<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{the bedroom door to harry's room is cracked open. peering through the cracked door, we see harry asleep on his pallet. his back is turned to the camera. it is dead silent. there does not seem to be any sign of life. on the floor is a plate that has water in it. it looks like it is for a dog.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{suzie is peeling potatoes and gideon is ironing.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{poor old harry, he really must have been worn out. he has been asleep all day.}
<A>__{without anyone being aware, harry has been standing in the doorway for some time.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{good evening. it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you should go back and rest.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, if i rest any longer, i won't sleep tonight. may i use your bathroom to wash up a bit?}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{man, act like this is your home.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's awful generous of you. i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{one can tell you are from back home. these people nowadays don't know what manners are.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{where we come from, you had to know how to act right. you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. you had to know your place.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{you had to tread softly.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings and gideon goes to answer it.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you remember that boy who lost his mind, joe? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. he wouldn't miss a one. make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. he would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{all those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call bottoms, have all been changed to drives and heights. everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.}
<A>__{gideon comes back with junior, pal and rhonda.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{harry, i would like for you to meet my oldest son, his wife and daughter.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{pleased to meet you. so you're from back home, too.}
<A>__{harry and junior shake hands, but rhonda gives harry only a nod of her head and a smile. pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with harry, but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{this boy must be turning over. oh, he just kicked me again.}
<A>__{junior feels her stomach. pat again tries to shake harry's hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. she finds a chair to sit down in. the sound of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look up.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{it's the boy next door throwing at his birds. i'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm going to wash up now. you all please excuse me.}
