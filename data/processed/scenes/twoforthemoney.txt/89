<A>__{two years i lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends? the sykes system's based on percentages the long haul.}

<A>__{no, that's called a mutual fund, jerry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{(to chuck) you gonna sit for this shit? chuck shrugs, finishes his muffin. jerry turns to walter }

<A>__{... he leads, i'm walking.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{he's leading. jerry unclips his microphone, stands.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{that's baby talk! you need a fucking rattle! sit down! (staring him down) you probably think you know what i'm gonna say... how everything you got i pay for. your apartment, your car, your kid's school and it's true. you'd be right. i do. now i don't know, jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't. i don't see you taking that chance. my gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet. and if you do, fuck it. i give a shit? the only reason i keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him (pointing at brandon) look good! now you got three fucking seconds to stop standing there like dog shit on my porch and sit down and shut the fuck up or you can kiss everything you have goodbye! the clock's started. beat. jerry sinks into his seat. walter turns to brandon.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{see that? he made the safe play. me, i would've walked, but i'm a fucked up human being. that's the difference between us. right there. jerry's a statistician, i'm a gambler. and you're not a gambler, not really until you bet more than you can afford to lose.}
