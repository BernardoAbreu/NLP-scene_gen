<A>__{all lights are out except the small bedside lamp on david's side. david sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands. jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over david's legs. david doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently... "train crash death toll confirmed at 131 dead. 1 survivor" beat. david slides out from under his son's legs. jeremy stirs but doesn't wake up. david moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. he opens a closet door. a naked hanging bulb goes on as david yanks a chain. david steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the light from the bulb doesn't}

<A>__{he pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. he opens the folder to reveal a young david in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. the word "champion" is written over his head. david flips through the top clippings all are images and stories of david and football. he turns the pile over. goes to the last clipping. this piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others. he opens it. it's a newspaper headline. it reads... "car accident leaves two injured" david puts the new headline next to the old one... they look like a set. even the font is similar. david stares at the old headline. stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... the bulb seems to flicker. david is utterly still. someone knocks at the bedroom door. david gets startled. he puts back the clippings. stuffing the new one inside with them. he replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet. another soft set of knocks as david moves across the bedroom. he opens the door. megan stands in the darkened hall. beat.}

<D>__{it won't affect me either way.}
<A>__{beat. david doesn't say anything. he just nods, "no." megan's face starts to tremble. she starts crying. tears roll over her very affected face. she tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. beat.}
