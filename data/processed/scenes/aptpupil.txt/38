<A>__{pockets the note. edward french, 40's, stands in the doorway. he wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{mr. bowden?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{mr. french, a pleasure.}
<A>__{there is a bit of hesitation on french's part, but they shake hands. dussander notices the shoes on french's feet, bright red converse high tops.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{my, those are some... colorful shoes.}
<L>__{interior high school french's office day}
<A>__{french makes his way around his desk. dussander stands by the door.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{to you, sir, i'm sure they seem quite out of the ordinary. but when it is your job to get confused sixteen year olds to open up to you, you take whatever steps you need. please have a seat.}
<A>__{they both sit.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{and the shoes work?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{they seem to help, believe it or not. well, i thank you for coming down, mr. bowden, but i will be frank with you...}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, please do.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{the fact that you're here and not todd's parents tells me a great deal.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i'm sure. my son and his wife asked me to come in and discuss this sorry business with you, mr. french. todd is a good boy, believe me. this trouble with his grades is only temporary.}
<A>__{dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then, thinking twice, puts them back.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<P>__{(pulls an ashtray from desk drawer)}
<D>__{there's no smoking on school grounds, but if it will make you more comfortable, i will never tell.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{a terrible habit, but thank you.}
<P>__{(lights up)}
<D>__{i suppose i should begin by informing you that my son and my daughter in law are having troubles at home. rather bad troubles, i should think.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{i appreciate your candor.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(leaning in)}
<D>__{the mother drinks.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes. the boy has told me that he has come home on two occasions and has found her sprawled out on the kitchen table. he knows how my son feels about her drinking and so on these occasions he has put dinner in the oven himself and forced enough black coffee down his mother's throat so that she will at least be awake when richard gets home.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{that's bad. has mrs. bowden thought about getting professional help for her problem?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{the boy has tried to persuade her, but she is far too ashamed, i think. if she was given a little time... you understand?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{of course. your son... todd's father...}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{he is not without blame, believe me. the hours he works. the meals he has missed. they take a toll on a family. i was raised to believe that a man's family came before his work or anything else. i tried to teach my son that... but }
<C>__{french}
<D>__{there's only so much we can teach our kids, mr. bowden. ...what about monica's mother or father? couldn't they talk to her?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{her mother, sabrina, lives in a nursing home in florida. i'm afraid after her husband died she lost her will to live.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{probably not the best person for monica to speak to.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{indeed.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{mr. bowden, i don't have to remind you, i'm sure, of todd's stellar academic record. national merit scholar finalist, academic all stars.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes. i keep his certificates on the wall of my store. i run a small bookstore in san remo.}
<A>__{a hint of skepticism crosses french's eyes.}
<C>__{french}
<P>__{(glancing at folder on desk)}
<D>__{yes, i see that. anyway, todd is, and i hate to phrase it this way, but he's one of the ones worth fighting for. he's a special kid, we both know that. but if todd's grades don't improve drastically and quickly... he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms. summer school would just be the beginning. his whole college acceptance schedule would be thrown way off course. the good schools won't know what to make of him. i'm sure he'd hate that and so would you.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{so let's get to the bottom line, shall we? what i'm proposing is some family counselling at the counselling center downtown. everything is in confidence, of course. a man in charge down there, harry shumacher, is a good friend of mine. i think todd and his parents should go see him together. it might be difficult for todd to go to his parents with this; i think you should do it. maybe we can get everybody on track by the end of the next quarter. it will be tough, but not impossible.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i'm not sure that would be the best thing for the boy. the parents might resent him if i took them that proposal right now. things are very delicate. to swing the scale too far in the wrong direction might cause more harm than good. the boy has promised to work harder in his studies. he is most concerned by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than you might expect. he has his mind set on attending stanford or berkeley next fall and does not wish to see his plans altered.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{yes, well }
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{also, the parents would resent me. monica already thinks i meddle too much in her affairs.}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{i have a great deal of experience in these matters, mr. bowden. and please understand that my interest in your son's marital problems begins and ends with the effect they are having on todd. and right now i think they are having quite an effect. i really think counselling is in order here.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{allow me to make a counter proposal. you have, i believe, a system for warning parents of poor grades?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{yes, interpretation of progress cards. iop cards. the kids call them flunk card. they only get them when their grades in a class fall below the seventy percent. that means a "d" or an "f". why?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{and they are sent out when?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{mid quarter. that's about three weeks into the new marking period.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{allowing for christmas break, the next time they are sent out will be in late january, correct?}
<C>__{french}
<D>__{yes, that's right.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{good. then what i suggest is this...}
