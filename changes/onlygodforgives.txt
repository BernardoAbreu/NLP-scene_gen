The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly he breaths in. Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall. Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist.}

It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing shapes and outlining fighting positions.

<ACTION>__{Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps back. Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut, connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed. Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt. Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back. Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off. He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot. Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back. Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs and punches to his upper body and face. Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him fall down. Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this enrages Julian. He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels, punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's down. But again no killer punch.}

Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels, using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.

Mai willing Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon... End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna. Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at but can't make it out. POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the fight - urging him to hit harder... Jenna then walks back to Gordon... On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the ring. Looking into the crowd. Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous. Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he knows... The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late. He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard. The Referee starts counting. Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful. Jenna holds her breath.

Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring. Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick - - which makes contact with Julian's draw. SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
