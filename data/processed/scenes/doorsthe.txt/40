<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{an old woman is beckoning to him from an opening in the face of the mountain... then she's gone. jim bounds towards the crevice.}
<L>__{interior rock palace day}
<A>__{he is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. the crone, muttering, leaving through another crevice. suddenly a mountain lion is visible, stretched hugely across a rock. it growls ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the cave. silence. jim, thunderstruck, gaping. a gallery of ancient indian petroglyphs surround him on all sides. curious, oblong figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities proclaiming the answers to the mysteries, the story of creation. camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities staring at him from the wall an eagle's face...}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{there's danger on the edge of town ride the king's highway weird scenes inside the gold mine ride the king's highway west, baby the sound of a rattle "shichishichi" he realizes he's being watched. by what? he whips his eyes everywhere. a large lizard perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... now the sound of the bull roarer, whipping the air, announcing the appearance of the shaman. jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient mysteries. he turns. the lizard is looking at him. the ghost of the dead indian is also looking at him. we are looking at jim from its point of view a blur of light, some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible spanish descent dialect or huararchi.}
<C>__{indian ghost voice}
<D>__{...you are a prince among white men, yet you are a warrior among us. you are ready now. go out "walk with the pain of the world, travel to the end of the wind" and change it for all men as you were born to do.}
<A>__{the voice, the pretense, the glow too quickly fades leaving jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen and once you have seen, it will never be the same again. his eyes.}
