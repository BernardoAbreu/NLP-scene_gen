<L>__{interior main floor continuous action}
<A>__{the group comes into the entryway. like an airlock, the outer door closes before the inner one will open.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i did mention i don't do windows, didn't i?}
<A>__{the walls of the entryway are lined with rare ancient documents in exquisite cases, archaeological treasures, recognizably priceless antiques. the group looks around, amazed. with fascination, arthur studies the text on the walls.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{latin...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yeah. that occurred to me.}
<A>__{with a huge smile bobby reaches for an ancient samurai sword on display. arthur catches him in mid act.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{in your dreams, kiddo.}
<A>__{they come to a great hall, a soaring open space with a large stained glass ceiling and, strangely, an equally large brass and copper floor. with only one other door at its opposite end, the room is a great glass cube.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{ohhh, cyrus. what did you do...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{okay. first rule. no throwing stones.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's marvelous, isn't it? a living work of art.}
<A>__{a few chuckles. but rafkin looks troubled. sweat beads on his forehead. his head is killing him, and he's rubbing incessantly on his temples.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{excuse me, the sooner you show me where you hid the basement the sooner i'm outta here }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i believe it's down the hall, second door on the right.}
<A>__{rafkin walks off, holding his head, leaving the others still examining the house. bobby's eye catches on the design in the floor made of a series of concentric metal rings. there's a brass disk in the center, two feet in diameter, with symbols etched into its surface, spinning slowly. bobby goes to place his foot on it, when arthur lifts him up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{don't touch anything. at least until we got some property insurance.}
<A>__{he places bobby down beside kathy and maggie.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{arthur, we have some papers to sign in the library. after that, i will give you a tour of the place.}
<A>__{arthur turns to the three of them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't want you guys to move from this spot. we'll be right back.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{dad }
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what happened to checking out our new digs?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you can see it all from here.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{dad... you're being paranoid and overprotective.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yeah... of all this stuff. i know you guys too well.}
<P>__{(points to spot)}
<D>__{stay. right. here. i mean it.}
<A>__{the three of them nod, appeasing him. arthur and ben walk off. after a beat, kathy, maggie and bobby slip away...}
