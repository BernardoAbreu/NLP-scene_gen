<A>__{elevator opens and john steps out into a lobby of concrete and glass. pretentious design screams money. lots of it. since trading is still a half hour away, the place is practically empty. across the room a stainless steal door hisses open. john looks the other way as a security guard exits. thick door glides closed, seals with another hiss. no way in. john notices the janitor down one hallway. it's nico from midnite's. he and john lock stares. nico opens a "security only" door, steps inside leaves the door open.}
