<A>__{one of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, nazi soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over indy. indy is struggling with a german's luger. indy presses the luger against his assailant and forces the nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. the bullet not only passes through the nazi, but passes through two other nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving indy to stare at the gun in disbelief. another soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs indy. they struggle and fall. indy sits up to see vogel standing over him. vogel wraps a chain around indy's neck.}
