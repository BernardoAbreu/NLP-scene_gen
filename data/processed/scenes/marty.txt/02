<A>__{new york city, west farms square. night west farms square is a big street in the bronx, filled with stores, bowling alleys and bars. cars push along between the pillars of the elevated subway structure. the noise of the subway trains roars by overhead every few moments. camera finds and establishes the stardust ballroom. it occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three story building. it is a hot june night, and the windows are open for ventilation purposes. music manufactured by dave greenglass and his band blends with the noises of the street. stardust ballroom. entrance vestibule stairs. music plays in the background. camera views clara, a plain girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, millie, prettier; millie's fiance andy, 30; and a second young man dr. keegan, also 30, who is a resident at fordham hospital. they are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street door.}

<D>__{all right, i'm having a fair time. it's just that i get one saturday night off in three weeks, and i wanted to wind up with something tonight.}
<A>__{they join the two girls waiting for them and start up the broad stairway to the second floor. they are halfway up, when two girls come in at the top of the stairs and start down. dr. keegan, who is holding clara's arm, looks up, nods. stardust ballroom, anteroom. this is a small, carpeted lobby with ticket taker in booth, a cloak room and rest rooms. painted posters on the walls announce coming events and caution against smoking. there are also large blow ups of musicians who had played this ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. about six or seven people congregate in the lobby, engaged in various indifferent activities. camera angles include the swinging doors, as clara, andy, millie and dr. keegan come in. as they enter, the doors to the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a girl in a black dress, quite pretty, comes in. she starts across the anteroom toward the cloak room, when dr. keegan calls out suddenly to her.}

<D>__{that's a girl used to know.}
<A>__{ballroom, lounge. a fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the other by cheap leatherette booths. it is brightly lit and crowded. there is a constant movement in and out of the lounge. at the far end of the lounge, there are two large iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out. dance music from dance floor. clara, dr. keegan, millie and andy come into the lounge and form a little group in the midst of moving passersby around them. a kind of strange excitement has begun to enter dr. keegan. he stands with the others, but his attention is devoted to ogling the passing girls, occasionally looking back to the doors leading to the anteroom.}

<B>__{ballroom.}
<A>__{the dance floor is fairly dark. a romantic effect is achieved by papier mache over the chandeliers. around the walls are the stag lines the men and waiting girls. they stand singly or in small uneasy groups. there is constant flux and movement. camera dollies slowly past the stag line, moving past faces, short, fat, tall, thin stags. some pretend indifference. some exhibit patent hunger. camera holds angling to include marty, angie near the end of the stag line. they are freshly shaved and groomed.}

<A>__{reverse angle past marty and angie across the dance floor toward the wall opposite, where three girls are standing. two are leaning against the wall. the third is facing them with her back to the dance floor. this last girl is the one angie has in mind. she is a cute little kid about twenty and wears a bright smile.}
<B>__{marty and angie.}
<A>__{they stare off toward the three girls across the room.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah, she looks all right from here.}

<A>__{the girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her hand languidly to dancing position and awaits angie with ineffable boredom. marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{excuse me, would you care for this dance?}
<A>__{the short girl gives marty a quick glance of appraisal, then looks quickly at her remaining friend.}

<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{you here stag or with a girl?}
<A>__{marty's attention is on the passing couples, so he doesn't seem to hear. angle widens to include the doctor standing on marty's right. suddenly aware of the doctor, marty turns his head.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you say something?}
<C>__{dr. keegan}
<D>__{yeah. i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.}

<D>__{i'm stag.}
<C>__{dr. keegan}
<D>__{well, i will tell you. i got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and i just met an old girl i used to know, and i was wondering how i'm gonna get rid of the girl i'm with. somebody to take her home, you know what i mean? i'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dr. keegan}
<D>__{i will take you over, and i will introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then i will cut out. because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and i will pay you five bucks.}

<P>__{(stares at the man)}
<D>__{are you kidding?}

<D>__{no, i'm not kidding.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you can't just walk off onna girl like that.}
<A>__{dr. keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. marty turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. the doctor approaches three stags and obviously broaches the subject with one of them. this stag seems more receptive to the idea. dr. keegan takes out a wallet and gives the stag a five dollar bill. the stag detaches himself from the wall and, a little ill at ease, follows the doctor. marty stands against the wall, watching the doctor and the stag, who come in and move past him. concerned and curious, marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning position, following in their general direction. marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the area around the dance floor.}

<B>__{lounge.}
<A>__{clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. dr. keegan and the stag stand over her, talking to her. she is looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a coca cola glass. dr. keegan is obviously introducing the stag to clara and is going through some story about being called away on an emergency. the stag is presented as her escort to be, who will see to it that she gets home safely. clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying hard not to seem affected. she politely rejects the stag's company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. dr. keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and the stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.}
<B>__{archway.}
<A>__{from where marty stands, he can watch clara, as well as dr. keegan and the stag. the doctor and the stag start past marty, and he catches their conversation.}

<D>__{look, mac, you paid me the five bucks. i was willing. it's my five bucks...}
<A>__{they move past and away and marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward clara off screen. clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the glass of coca cola in front of her. her eyes are closed. then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do. as she glances around, camera angles to include a sign over an exit that reads "fire escape." clara starts moving toward that door. marty is staring off screen toward clara. he slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape.}

<A>__{it is sizeable, almost a small balcony. it looks out onto the backs of innumerable five story apartment houses. clara is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her head sunk down. she is crying. marty watches her for a moment before moving a step or two forward. clara doesn't turn. marty tries to think of something to say.}

<D>__{excuse me, miss, would you care to dance?}
<A>__{clara slowly turns to marty, her face streaked with tears, her lips trembling. then, in one of those moments of simultaneous impulse, she lurches to marty with a sob, and marty takes her to him. they stand in an awkward embrace, marty a little embarrassed, looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, wondering if anybody is seeing them. he reaches back with one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of the heavy iron doors shut. he returns his hand around the girl's shoulders. he stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on his chest, as we...}
