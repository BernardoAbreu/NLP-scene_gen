<L>__{interior transporto day}
<A>__{goyal is seated at the communication station. on the monitor frank is settled in opposite cara.}
<C>__{goyal}
<D>__{he's not going anywhere.}
<A>__{ackerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going to see something different.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{put lipetti in. tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest escort him out.}
<L>__{exterior cipriani hotel, poolside restaurant day}
<A>__{cara looks all around. no sign of any suitor approaching. close on: the hands of the thin waiter, who sprinkles pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. he then platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{probably not. but i'm doing it anyway. alexander pearce nearly got me killed. it was his idea, right?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{he told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he?}
<A>__{frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{well i'm not playing the role anymore. i'm going to confront him. he's supposed to meet you here, isn't he? i'm going to tell him exactly what i think of him.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{wonderful. another macho idiot.}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{conto, per favore!}
<A>__{frank leans in.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the lure, cara? obviously not his character. is it the money? the luxury? what's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i'm leaving frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he's smooth, right? he probably has mistresses in every european city, too.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it's really a shame you've scared him off }
<A>__{she tosses some euros on the table.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{the two of you make a nice couple.}
<A>__{the thin waiter arrives with a platter. he sets it down in front of cara. the undercover waiter now moves toward the table with a grim expression... the thin waiter removes the platter. cara looks down. spelled out in salt and pepper on the plate is the following: "my villa. tonight. 8pm." cara no sooner reads it than the thin waiter, who we now see is the englishman... ...blows on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper granules to the wind.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{as frank looks up. the englishman has already turned away, but the undercover waiter is moving quickly toward cara's table. the undercover waiter picks up speed, changing course slightly. we see he's after the englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen... then frank steps in front of the undercover waiter, mistaking him for pearce.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{is this him?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{frank!}
