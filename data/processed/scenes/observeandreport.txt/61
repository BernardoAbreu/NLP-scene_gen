<L>__{interior department store day}
<A>__{brandi is behind the counter gossiping with bruce. ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance. he takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{brandi?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i came here to see you. and to present you with this single red rose. it symbolizes 'love.'}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{ronnie, that's really... uncalled for.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, after last night, i just wanted you to know that it wasn't just some fling to me. it meant something special and i felt it deep in my soul.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you fucked the security guard?}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{you are such a little slut!}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{oh, like you've never been drunk, bruce!}
<A>__{brandi grabs ronnie and pulls him off to the side.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{ronnie, look. i got to be honest with you. i barely remember last night.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i remember it for the both of us.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{okay, see here's the thing. i don't know how to say this, so i'm just gonna come on out with it. ronnie, i could never date you seriously. i mean, you're a security guard.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm the head of mall security.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{exactly. the point is, i don't really see myself being with that. like ever. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{brandi, i know exactly what you mean. and i just want to thank you for being honest. you're telling me i'm not living up to my full potential in life. it's funny, because i've been feeling like this for quite some time. i guess i just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle i've been stuck on. how can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{yeah, something like that. and just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i don't like it, brandi, but i do understand. i promise you this. next time you see me, i will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud. i will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{don't bet on it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i will though. i will bet everything i have on you. now i ask you for one favor. although i am unworthy, will you accept this rose from me anyway?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i can't do that. and tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit.}
<A>__{brandi walks away, leaving ronnie there holding his flower.}
