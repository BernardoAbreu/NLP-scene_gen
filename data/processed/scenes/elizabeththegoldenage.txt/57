<L>__{interior captain's cabin, tyger day}
<A>__{lose on pen and paper a letter being written in haste. raleigh at a ship's table littered with charts. he's writing a letter to the queen. calley enters.}
<C>__{calley}
<D>__{visitor for you, sir.}
<L>__{exterior deck, tyger day}
<A>__{the tyger is in dock. raleigh emerges from his cabin to find bess waiting for him.}

<D>__{the queen has sent you to me.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{yes }
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{tell the queen that i will trouble her no more. as soon as my ship's repairs are complete i will ask permission to sail.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{the queen asks me to assure you }
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i need no assurances. i'm no courtier and never have been. i've lost my appetite for playing games that it seems i'm too stupid to understand.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{that is unfair }
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{you call me unfair!}

<D>__{let me speak!}
<A>__{raleigh is taken aback by bess's sudden anger.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{the queen shouts at you once, and you sulk like a child. i thought you more of a man than that. and i thought you a better friend to the queen. her every move is watched by a hundred eyes. assassins plot to kill her. enemies prepare to overwhelm her country. and you say she's playing games?}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{very well. what is my queen's command?}
<C>__{bess}
