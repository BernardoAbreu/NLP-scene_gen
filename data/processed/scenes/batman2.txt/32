<A>__{he drops the shovel as the bird strikes, glancing off his head. before he can react, three more pigeons have swooped down at him, pecking at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. he lets out a howl and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. dozens of pigeons are pouring over the prison walls, shrieking hideously, descending on him. he falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... by the time the guards come racing across the courtyard, t bone's no longer even visible. there's just a swarming, man shaped mass of pigeons, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. covering their faces as they move in, the guards blow their whistles beat at the pigeons with billy clubs. all at once, the pigeons take off en masse leaving t bone's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. a guard notices the walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but rock music "surfin' bird" by the trashmen. bird bird bird, bird is the word...}
