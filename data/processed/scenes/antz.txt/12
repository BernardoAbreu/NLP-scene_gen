<L>__{exterior ant mound night}
<A>__{it's a starry, moonlit night. the shadows crowd around the panicked z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait a minute, there's been a mistake! i've got to get back to the colony!}
<A>__{z starts to fall out of line, but barbatus, looking concerned, stops him.}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{are you crazy, kid? they shoot deserters!}
<A>__{z swallows hard.}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{you just stick by old barbatus. he'll watch out for you.}
<P>__{(off z's look)}
<D>__{whatsamatter, kid? leave a girl behind?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{yeah. well no. she's kind of playing hard to get. as a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{so, what's on the schedule? a brisk walk? a foraging expedition?}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{no we're going to attack the termites!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{attack? but i hate attacking! it's so hostile!}
<A>__{around z and barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between barbatus and z to form a montage time cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital.}
<C>__{ant soldiers}
<P>__{(to the tune of "when}
<D>__{johnny comes}
<P>__{marching home")}
<D>__{we ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah! we slaughter termites just for fun, hurrah! hurrah!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects?}
<C>__{barbatus}
<P>__{(grim smile)}
<D>__{no such luck. those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads!}
<C>__{soldier ants}
<D>__{we ants go marching two by two, hurrah! hurrah! we'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah! hurrah!}
<A>__{montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen, fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, what exactly does our platoon do? serve beverages? process paperwork?}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{our platoon has the best assignment of all. we're the first into battle!}
<C>__{ant soldiers}
<D>__{we ants are marching three by three, hurrah! hurrah! dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah! hurrah!}
<A>__{...montage shot of z's column crossing a bridge composed of living ants all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as they're getting stepped on...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so we're going back for more armor, right? i mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{superior numbers, kid!}
