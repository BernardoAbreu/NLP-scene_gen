<L>__{interior reception area, putnam's day}
<A>__{the crowded waiting room. we close on a young woman we scarcely recognize. it is elinor. though less than a year has passed, she seems much older. sophisticated, poised. angle. a secretary leads elinor down the corridor to george's office. as they enter, george is pacing on the phone.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{because amelia invented the powder puff derby for female pilots. then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the rockies so they won't crash into the mountains!}
<A>__{listens, impatient.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i will tell you why it's a front page story. because amelia pulled every woman out of the race. so the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. you want me to write your headline?}
<A>__{he glances over. elinor in the doorway.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{call you back. i've got a very important guest.}
<A>__{he hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit. as she does...}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{wish i was important enough for you to manage.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, i've just got one client. and most days she's more than i can manage.}
<A>__{even elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the derby.}
<A>__{he grins back. you bet.}
<P>__{elinor (cont’d)}
<D>__{some of the gal flyers had their doubts about her...well, her skill level. but she's everyone's champion now.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and both of those things. are the reasons i called you.}
<A>__{strange words. he has her attention.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i think it would be huge for women flyers if amelia won the derby. the publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i'm not sure she has much of a chance, mr. putnam.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. we're thinking the lockheed vega.}
<A>__{the girl's shock. he really means this.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{sir, i've test piloted the vega. it's way more than she could ever handle. it wouldn't be safe, let alone successful.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's why i'm thinking of you flying with her. you could handle the cross country flying, the more difficult bits, and i'd pay you $75 a week.}
<A>__{elinor whistles low.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{well, i think that's the most generous opportunity i've ever been offered.}
<A>__{he stares at her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{there's just one thing. obviously, it has to appear that amelia did all the flying. so when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side.}
<A>__{her eyes narrow. he's completely serious.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{in that case, i will get my own plane and win the race myself.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you haven't changed.}
<A>__{no smile at all.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{unfortunately for you, neither have i.}
<A>__{the look in his eye is not to be ignored.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{you can't win if you can't get a plane to enter. let me predict that you won't.}
<A>__{the voice calm and low and riveting.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{in fact. if you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it. for a long, long time.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{that's a threat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm an intensely loyal person, elinor. and this is what my loyalty requires.}
<A>__{she's glaring. reeling. trapped.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{she's the one who said i shouldn't let anybody turn me around.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she probably meant me.}
<A>__{so honest, the words confuse her.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, sure she does.}
<A>__{a straight smile...}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{she just doesn't care.}
<A>__{...which silently fades.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{my job. is to care for her.}
