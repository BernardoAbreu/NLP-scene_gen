<A>__{music's loud. league night. every lane full. welles is with his team in bowling shirts. welles hoists his ball, preparing to bowl. he takes three steps, releases... down the lane, pins scatter. one pin remains standing. welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his rowdy, mocking teammates. he shouts back at them, laughing, grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return.}
