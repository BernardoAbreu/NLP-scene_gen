<L>__{interior haven's bedroom day}
<A>__{haven is lying on the bed, his arms under his head, his eyes on the ceiling. there is a sound in the hallway and then a hurried knock at the door. haven slowly rises, walks to the door. he stands there. the knock sounds again.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{mark's voice}
<D>__{it's me bristow let me in.}
<A>__{haven opens the door. mark enters swiftly, the little gun in his hand. haven shuts the door and locks it. he turns and faces mark, now pointing the gun. without a word haven walks over to the bed and lies down again, looking at the ceiling. mark follows him with the gun.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you going to shoot me, mark?}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{you double crossed me, haven.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i did?}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{i got the deposition back. i took it to them.}
<A>__{haven leans on one elbow, looking at him.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{it wasn't there! it was a piece of blank paper!}
<A>__{haven lies back with a short laugh. mark stares at him in fury.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{don't you laugh at me! i ought to kill you!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{they want you to, mark.}
<A>__{haven again leans on one elbow, looking at mark and the trembling hand that holds the gun.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{and it may be your only out, if you do. but i doubt it. you know why? because even if you took them my scalp, it wouldn't buy your life. you're in debt and you're broke and you're scared and you know far too much. there isn't any way they use you alive. can you think of one?}
<A>__{mark sits slowly back in the chair, beaten.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{they're going to do it. i know it. they're going to kill me }
<P>__{(his hand trembles)}
<D>__{why do they have to kill me?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{us, mark...}
<A>__{haven gets up slowly, reaches over and takes the little gun, smiles at it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{this must be hers.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{she's sweet.}
<A>__{he puts the gun on the table. mark's teeth are chattering. he is almost ready to cry. haven gets a bottle and pours him a drink in a dusty glass. he hands it to mark.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{there's one thing, mark.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(gulping the drink)}
<D>__{there is?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you might get out of town.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{there isn't a chance in a thousand.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if there's one in a million, it's the only one you have.}
<A>__{mark gets up waveringly. takes another hooker.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{yes we might get away with it. we might...}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<A>__{mark stares at him. haven smiles grimly back.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i have to stay.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{but you can't stay. you said yourself }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if you must do this, go straight to your horse. don't stop for anything.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{ i've got a lot of important papers }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you haven't got anything important left, mark except your life, and very little time to keep it. you do it very fast and you might be lucky.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(trying to pull himself together)}
<D>__{yes. i might be. i will try it.}
<A>__{mark hurries out into the hall. goes. haven turns back and looks at the room, picks up the little pistol, smiles at it. shrugs and then slips into his coat and exits, too.}
