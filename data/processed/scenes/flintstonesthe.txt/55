<A>__{up above barney dodging pyrite's renewed attack. now, barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. pyrite comes around the corner... barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under his legs! then, as pyrite stumbles, barney stamps his ass with the word "reject." pyrite looks back, sees this, reddens... raises his club.}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{reject, huh? whaddya say we reject your head?}
<A>__{he raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! pyrite drops the club, howls }
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{the alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked rejects and drops him. howling, pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective fibrerock goods.}
<B>__{barney}
<A>__{chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. camera adjusts and we see that piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate freds. worried, barney looks around, sees that he's just above the fibrefoam chute. without another thought, he jumps into it slides downward like a passenger on the magerock mountain log flume ride }
<B>__{below}
<A>__{piltdown is about to swing at the real fred when barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and fred! all three of them roll across the floor towards }
<B>__{the end of the building}
<A>__{where a squad of policemen has just appeared led by a dripping wet feldspar and gravel!}
<C>__{feldspar}
<D>__{all right! you're all under arr }
<A>__{wham! barney, fred and piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{whattya know. even got the spare again...}
<A>__{then he gasps as he looks over at fred, whose head has just fallen off! pause. fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and fibre shoulders. before he can extricate himself further, feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building.}
