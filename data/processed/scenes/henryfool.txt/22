<D>__{she's clinically depressed.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yeah, and what's that mean?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(thinking, then)}
<D>__{i guess it means it's not her fault.}
<A>__{henry wanders out to the road, checking his wallet, then...}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{you ever think of leaving?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{to go where?}

<A>__{simon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yeah, i guess.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(reciting)}
<D>__{'opportunity will step away and make room for a man to pass it by.'}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{is that from your book?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no. i found it in a fortune cookie.}
<A>__{he pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of his pockets and shows it to simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{can i read your confession?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no. not yet. soon. we'll see.}

<D>__{is it almost finished?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(puffing himself up)}
<D>__{well, you know, simon, a piece of work like this, it's... a vocation like ours... you can't put a fence around a man's soul. what i'm trying to achieve, it's... well, it takes a lifetime really. it's a life's work.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{but soon. don't worry. i'd appreciate your feedback. i gotta go. see ya.}
<A>__{he hurries away around the corner. simon walks back to the house and stops when he sees... a plain clothes policeman, officer bunuel, drive up and park before the house. simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on henry's door. he, of course, gets no answer.}
