<A>__{paul steps into the kitchen. nervously checking his blackberry. nothing. just then he sees the red light blinking on his answer machine. he presses play.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{paul? you home yet? can you pick up? i just don't want it to end like this.}
<A>__{paul's relieved. he picks up the phone. dials. we hear the ringing on the other end.}
<L>__{interior hospital morgue same time}
<A>__{two technicians, an old guy and his young pale assistant, push a naked body wrapped in plastic through the morgue. they jump as they hear the muffled sound of a cell phone. the ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on a table (we recognize it as anna's bag). the assistant walks over. takes out the cell phone.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{it's the schoolteacher's. from the car crash. should i answer it?}
<A>__{the ringing stops abruptly. it's suddenly very silent.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{someone's in for a surprise.}
<C>__{old guy}
<D>__{how many times do i have to tell you? you can't leave their stuff laying around. it should've been returned to the family.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{i've been busy, ok.}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{like she's really going to need her rollover minutes now.}
<A>__{as the assistant reaches for the bag, he notices a solitary shoe on the table. he picks it up.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{what shall i do with this?}
<C>__{old guy}
<D>__{where's the other one?}
<A>__{the assistant looks round. he can't see the other shoe anywhere. he turns to the old guy and shrugs.}

<D>__{just burn it. you can't send them back one shoe. it's not respectful.}
