<B>__{the tank}
<A>__{containing the vampire child has been smashed open. it's empty now, with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a widening pool and a trail of tiny bloody footprints leading back out into the main workshop.}

<A>__{karen scans the shadows, eyes alert. we hear a whisper, then a teasing, childish, giggle. whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over every inch of the room. and just as he's about to complete his circuit }
<B>__{the child}
<A>__{leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! karen screams. whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his hand the feral child lands atop whistler, hissing like a cobra. its macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque proportions. and just as it's about to strike zzzzing! whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden inside his cane. he lunges forward whoosh! the child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes and medical equipment crashing to the floor. it zips past karen }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{get it!!!}
<A>__{karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as whistler struggles to his feet karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses of the child as it darts through the workshop. she reaches a shelving unit where whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified pistols karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. she fires, misses, fires again she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the creature is moving closer and suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs bared! the child knocks karen back against the wall. it's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck. karen chokes, forcing whistler's pistol under the monstrosity's chin but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific little cherubim of a child and karen hesitates, because the child seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and hypnotic and suddenly whistler reaches in from behind, yanking the vampire child's head back, firing a pistol into its skull. the creature slumps karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. as it continues to writhe thunk! whistler swings his cane rapier down on the creature, brutally decapitating it. finishing the job. then he looks to karen, winded.}
