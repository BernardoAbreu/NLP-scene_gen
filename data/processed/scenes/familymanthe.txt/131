<C>__{jack}
<D>__{welcome to xanadu...}
<A>__{the place is incredible...marble floors, architectural lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture... its striking but not at all homey like the jersey house.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{pretty incredible, isnt it?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{its like a museum.}
<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(turning to jack)}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{for the week?}
<A>__{jack chuckles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this place is a perk, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{a perk for what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a company called p.k. lassiter and associates investment house uses it to attract new executives...}
<A>__{kates confused.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{youre talking to their new vice president of mergers and acquisitions.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what are you talking about, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{im going into arbitrage, honey. turns out i have a knack for it. ill be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and thats just to start. and, we can live in this apartment practically rent free for as long as we want.}
<A>__{jack measures her reaction. its not good...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{we can finally afford to move back into the city. in style.}
<A>__{kate just looks at him, in shock. then...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i dont think so. this is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. well put annie and josh in private schools...}

<D>__{annie goes to a great school.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{im talking about the best schools in the country here, kate...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{jack, what could you possibly be thinking? what about my job?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is new york city, its like the needy people capital of the world. those jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{i cant believe you want to move back into the city. i thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, this is the center of the universe. if i were living in roman times, i would live in rome, where else? today, america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself. john lennon.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{jack.}
<A>__{jacks starting to struggle...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, im detecting a kind of funky tension here...we dont have to live in this apartment. i dont need this...ill commute...ill drive to work...}
<A>__{jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked apart...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{in traffic? its over an hour each way? thats almost three hours a day. when are you going to see the kids?}
<A>__{hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather himself. then...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{kate. youre not understanding me. im talking about a great life. a perfect life. everything we pictured when we were young. the whole package. you said it yourself, life has thrown us surprises, and so we made sacrifices. but now i can finally get us back on track...}
<A>__{a sad chuckle from kate.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i can do that. i want to do that. for all of us. i need to do that as a man...}
<P>__{(imploring her)}
<D>__{think about it. no more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{then get a goddamn snow blower!}
<A>__{jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{dont get a new career without even telling me. dont take annie out of a school she loves. dont move us out of a house weve become a family in...}
<A>__{kate stands there, wounded...}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{dont do that...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, youre making this into something its not. this isnt a referendum on our lives, kate. its a step forward...}
<P>__{(appealing to her)}
<D>__{dont you see? im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.}
<A>__{silence. kate looks him in the eye a deep, piercing look...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{they already do envy us, jack...}
<A>__{kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.}
