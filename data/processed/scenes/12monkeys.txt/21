<L>__{interior art gallery night}
<A>__{a strikingly "real" world of bright colors. extravagant paintings adorn the walls. a poet, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an audience of thirty seated on folding chairs.}
<C>__{poet}
<D>__{still among the myriad microwaves, the infra red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "we are no other than a moving row of magic shadow shapes that come and go round with the sun illumined lantern hold in midnight by the master of the show."}
<A>__{as the poet reads, we study the audience, mostly yuppie culture junkies or bohemians. among them, a light haired woman of twenty eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. she's kathryn railly. and it's her beeper that suddenly beeps. beep! beep!}
<C>__{poet's voice }
<D>__{"the moving finger writes; and, having writ, moves on: nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, nor all your tears wash out a word of it."}
<A>__{beep! beep! scowling at the outrageous interruption, the poet looks up from the text just as railly, tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed. as she makes her way to an exit, the glaring poet continues...}
<C>__{poet}
<D>__{"yesterday this day's madness did prepare; tomorrow's silence, triumph or despair: drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: drink! for you know not why you go, nor where."}
