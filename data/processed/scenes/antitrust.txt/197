<A>__{alice pulls into a dress. in the kitchen continuous milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok. he grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another.}

<D>__{you look beautiful.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{yeah? give me a goodbye kiss.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...what?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i know you. you're gonna run back to work right after dinner. i want my kiss now.}
<A>__{either she's the most cold blooded woman in the world, or... he takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard as if his life depended on it. when he releases her, she pretends to swoon. she backs toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{be right back.}
<A>__{kitchen a moment later camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big bowl as alice spoons the food into it... she sprinkles on some final ingredient, also minced. dining room continuous milo's fingers drum the table top... kitchen continuous alice picks up the dish. we don't see her face. on the dish moving continuous (alice's pov) we hold the dish out in front of us. the food shines in the light, a poisonous yellow gleam. we move from kitchen to dining room, slowly, deliberately... milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile. we come all the way to the table with the dish, where alice sets it down. she sits. milo, still vamping, pours wine. he picks up his fork. stares at it.}

<D>__{don't we have any chopsticks?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{oh, right. hold on.}
<A>__{when she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the tines of his fork against it, making score marks, like those used by allergists to test for sensitivity. he dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. he stares at it.}
