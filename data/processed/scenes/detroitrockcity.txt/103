<L>__{interior smiley mart night}
<A>__{it's a stand off. prone customers look up at trip and the man with the long coat circling each other like sharks. the helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{gimme your gun, boy!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{no, you gimme your gun, boy!}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{don't tempt me, i will shoot!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{not if i shoot first!}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{i don't even think you have a gun!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{neither do i!}
<A>__{the man with the coat puts his shotgun against trip's head.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{now, for the last time, take the piece out and lay back down or your mom's gonna need the white tornado to get the brains outta your ski cap.}
<A>__{trip gulps. the jig's up. he slowly pulls out stretch armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts to laugh very loud. so loud, he throws his head back. when he recovers, trip's got stretch aimed at his head and pulled back to maximum tension.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{smile, you sonofa...}
<A>__{trip lets go. wzzmack! the man gets it right in the face and falls backward onto the hostess display, toppling a whole bunch of ho ho's, ding dong's, twinkies, and suzy o's to the ground. trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out. trip turns around and the cashier slams into him, nearly knocking him over. she throws her arms around him letting out relieved sobs. behind her all the customers rise from the floor clapping. trip did it. he saved the fucking store! the cashier looks into trip's masked eyes.}
<C>__{cashier}
<D>__{thank you! thank you!... who are you?}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(with confidence)}
<D>__{call me... dr. love!}
<A>__{she plants a thousand mega watt kiss on his lips and we zoom in on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine red. trip's eyes widen just before... kaboom... the shotgun he's holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling. the recoil from the blast jolts trip and the cashier apart. we now see trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick. a huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't move. the kiss hit him harder. i'm here for the girl and the car}
