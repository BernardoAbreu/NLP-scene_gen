<A>__{the suburban high school is teeming with morning activity. school buses pull up to the curb. kids arrive in droves and immediately find their cliques. the jocks and primadonnas make up the popular crowd. there's disco dudes, freshmen who look like grade schoolers, and geeks. at the smoking section hang the burnouts. hawk, trip, and lex stand amid the other long hairs.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{school. what a fuckin' waste of time.}
<A>__{two girls with tons of make up, hair so feathered it could fly, and tight clothes, saunter by snapping gum.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{stellas. i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{same species when you think about it.}
<A>__{their words say one thing, but their eyes say another. they can't stop gawking at the chicks' asses. girl #1 sneers back.}
<D>__{girl #1 don't stare too long, you'll go blind.}

<C>__{trip}
<D>__{you know what they say about a big ass... big shit.}
<A>__{they chuckle. just then, jam steps off a school bus in an unbelievably geeky outfit, white corduroy slacks, plaid shirt buttoned to the top, argyle socks and brown deck shoes.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{hey, that dork looks just like jam.}
<A>__{hawk and lex look and laugh when they see him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{shit, that dork is jam.}
<C>__{hawk}
