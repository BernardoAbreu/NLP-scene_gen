<A>__{lonnegan's in line at the betting window. there are four people in front of him this time, and they are moving rather slowly. the "last flash" call is heard on the speakers.}

<P>__{(getting impatient)}
<D>__{c'mon, let's hurry up there.}
<A>__{the man at the head of the line turns around and gives lonnegan a chilling look, as if he were beneath contempt. he puts down $25,000 on grand theft. the next man in line plunges down $30,000 on wrecking crew. just as lonnegan is about to step to the window, gondorff gives a quick signal to singleton. the speakers come on.}

<A>__{lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk.}
