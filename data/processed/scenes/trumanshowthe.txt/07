<L>__{exterior long, wide beach. day, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen. a sandy haired, seven year old truman, runs towards a bluff on the beach. the boy's father, kirk, late thirties, beer bottle in hand, flirts with two teenage girls at the shoreline. suddenly, the father remembers his son. he looks anxiously around. the sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him. the boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(out of breath, clutching his side)}
<D>__{truman! truman! stop!}
<A>__{truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his father. but the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the anger and distress on his father's face.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{come down now!}
<A>__{his father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more tantalizing. the boy considers defying his father. he puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side. one good stretch would do it.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(reading truman's mind, enraged)}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(sensing his father is keeping something from him)}
<D>__{why? what's there?}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{nothing's there. it's the same as this.}
<P>__{(trace of desperation)}
<D>__{come down, please!}
<A>__{truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other beachgoers have stopped their activities to stare at him. reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks. when he finally jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and drags him away down the beach.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i told you to stay close. don't ever leave my sight again. you gotta know your limitations. you could've been washed away by the tide.}
