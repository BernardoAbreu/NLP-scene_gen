<A>__{luke watches the distant tusken raider through his electrobinoculars. suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. before luke or threepio can react, a large, gruesome tusken raider looms over them. threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. he can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain. the towering creature brings down his curved, double pointed gaderffii the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. but luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. the terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. the sinister raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh.}
