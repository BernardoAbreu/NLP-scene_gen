<A>__{last few yards to the shack. inside shack same on beck sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments and suddenly, dejesus' gauges jump to life. we see the same countdown in progress on the shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{on dejesus he is forced into the lock, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit. his readout continues inside his helmet...5, 4, 3...dejesus screams.}
<B>__{on beck}
<A>__{dejesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. beck hits the elevator switch nothing happens. he hits it again harder and suddenly dejesus voice is drowned out by the screaming vacuum pumps of the elevator. it's moving! beck looks up at the monitor of the interior lift lock. inside lift lock we see dejesus's suit dripping wet. it stands inside the lift lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water. close on his eyes, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter. he's alive! the mess later the blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the mess features neatly stenciled letters that say: "days till pickup". the number scrawled on the chalk smudged board obviously changes daily. right now, it's a "3"... a clunk, clunk and a coke can rolls out of a compact coke machine. a big, sandy haired man, sixpack, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners: jones, black, athletic, 30's; cobb, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum; bowman, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them; willie, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. dejesus, latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience. the strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.}

<D>__{i'm telling you, it's the suits!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. it doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{and just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh?}
<A>__{sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the empty coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a huge belch.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{that would have been you, dejesus...}
<A>__{dejesus keeps his head down.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah...i was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the indian ocean...little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ...ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. they just buried his helmet.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i know all about implosion, man.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah, i bet you do.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i bet you were imploding in your pants.}
<P>__{(laughs then imitates a hysterical dejesus)}
<D>__{jonesy! doc!...help me! help me!}
<A>__{dejesus springs for sixpack's throat as we cut to: beck same beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{knock it off, sixpack! i know it's been a long month for every one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart...}
<A>__{beck glares, ready for an argument, but as we pull back we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters. apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{he turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his eastern establishment looking father. leadership "how to" books like the one minute manager , etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining. he opens his door to leave when suddenly a loud metallic groaning noise stops him cold. the entire shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.}
<B>__{mess}
<A>__{the noise stops the fight between dejesus and sixpack cold. all eyes go to the ceiling and walls.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck the suits man...this place is going to kill us first.}
<A>__{just as suddenly as it began the groaning noise stops and in its place we hear an intermittent rattle in the air system. only cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{there it is again...}
<P>__{(sitting down again)}
<D>__{two more days. i tell myself 'you can make it two more days '}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{what's the weather like up top?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{clear for pickup.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{let's hope it holds.}
<A>__{cobb looks up disgustingly.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{then what? huh?}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{then what? you folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems. well, it ain't.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{give us a break, cobb...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{a break? you folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists. 'know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now?}
<C>__{sixpack}

<D>__{eating pussy and drinking brew...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{eating pussy my ass. what about lines at the bank: what about getting stuck in traffic?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{wherever i can find it.}
<A>__{everyone laughs but cobb, we see he's serious.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{bullshit! i will tell you what you'd be doing! you'd be watching news on tv that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous. so you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it! that's what you've got to look forward to...}
