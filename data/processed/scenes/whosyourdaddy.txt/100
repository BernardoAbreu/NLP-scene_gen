<L>__{interior nelson grocery store day}
<A>__{dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{son, it's a simple fix. the only difference between my store and that magazine of yours is a bunch of zeros. now, have i ever told you the story about the can of peaches?}
<L>__{interior conference hall day}
<A>__{a "heaven" stockholders' meeting in progress. uncle billy stands at the podium.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{ladies, gentlemen. "heaven" has gone to hell.}
<A>__{behind him are charts, wall graphs. we quickly realize he is a complete and utter turn coat.}
<C>__{uncle billy }
<D>__{i loved my brother. i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. a son he never knew. a son that he and his wife gave away at birth. a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. nevertheless, i was there for the lad. i guided him as best i could. but he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. there is only one clear solution...}
<P>__{(gesturing to himself)}
<D>__{and i think we all know what that is }
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{ peaches! canned peaches!}
<A>__{ted bursts into the meeting with his dad. holding up a can of peaches. suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him. curious, bewildered. ted dashes to the podium, with passion in his soul and fire in his belly.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my job. back off, benedict.}
<A>__{uncle billy steps into the shadows as ted looks out at the crowd. he's petrified. but he takes a deep breath and finds the courage to explain...}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{the only man i called "dad" owns a little grocery store in xenia, ohio. he learned a lot of cool stuff from my grandpa, who was a peach farmer in his day. grandpa knew the right thing to say in every situation, and it usually involved peaches. my dad's a lot like him. and he taught me, you have to focus on the peachy side of life, not the pits.}
<A>__{dad's eyes are filled with tears. he's never been so proud.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest, greatest thing ever invented. it was like a little taste of summer, anytime you wanted. grocery stores couldn't keep them in stock, they were so popular. and even though other canned fruits like pears, plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want them. it's comforting, you know? it fulfills their expectations.}
<A>__{the stockholders are listening. uncle billy grins nervously. unable to believe ted is pulling this off.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{you're probably wondering if there's a point to all this and i guess it's just that i goofed last month. i not only moved the canned peaches, i restocked the shelves with kiwi, guava, and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup. i challenged people's expectations. and you can't do that to your customers. so, i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches.}
<A>__{the stockholders applaud enthusiastically, giving ted a standing ovation. ted turns to uncle billy.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{thanks for teaching me an important lesson. what makes a family is love, not blood.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{all is fair in "heaven," ted baby.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's right. and guess who's the new king of the unemployment line.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{aw, come on, kid. throw me a bone. i'm your uncle for gosh sakes.}
