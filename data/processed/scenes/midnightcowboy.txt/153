<L>__{interior x flat day}
<A>__{joe is seated in a straight back chair near the x window, a towel tucked around his neck as ratso trims his hair, almost as expert a barber as shoeshine boy.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{stupid bastard coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day. they buried him with gloves on. even the fag undertaker couldn't get his nails clean.}
<A>__{as if by conditioned reflex, ratso chokes on the cigarette in his mouth, coughing painfully. he crushes it out, opens the window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to remove the towel from joe's neck.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kee rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{you like it? take a look.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't rush me. how i do it, see, i get myself primed, like i was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and swing around! and there you are, you handsome devil.}
<A>__{joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed, faintly laughing at himself with ratso. the wall mirror has been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless overstuffed chair with burnt out cushions, a tasselled table cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new florida tourist posters, ratso moves to joe's side, arranging the neckerchief, nodding.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{not bad for a cowboy you're okay, you're okay.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what i'm gonna do, i'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. how about that? build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, rat stuff.}
<A>__{joe slaps his hat on ratso's head, tilts it, hooks ratso's thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of ratso's mouth. ratso laughs till he chokes for one instant, self consciously, mimicking joe then removes the hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{okay, you got yourself one handsome, sweet smelling cowboy, strut your stuff...}
