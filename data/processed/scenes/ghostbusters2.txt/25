<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior university day}
<A>__{dana barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. a sign identifies it as "the institute for advanced theoretical research."}
<L>__{interior university day (a little later)}
<A>__{dana is explaining the buggy incident to egon spengler, the soberly intellectual techno wizard and former ghostbuster, as he conducts an experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom are japanese, chinese, or korean. the device he is testing is a black box about the size of a sony watchman with both digital and graphic displays.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{did anyone else see this happen?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{hundreds of people. believe me, i didn't imagine this.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{i'm not saying you did. in science we always look for the simplest explanation.}
<A>__{an assistant interrupts.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{we're ready, dr. spengler}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(to the assistant)}
<D>__{we'll start with the negative calibration.}
<A>__{he picks up the device and prepares to test it.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{what are you working on, egon?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{i'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field. it's a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters.}
<A>__{an assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually a two way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. inside the waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated arguement.}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(to dana)}
<D>__{they think they're here for marriage counseling. we've kept them waiting for two hours and we've been gradually increasing the temperature in the room.}
<P>__{(checking a heat sensor)}
<D>__{it's up to 95 degrees at the moment. now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if they'd mind waiting another half hour.}
<A>__{as spengler, dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. they explode with anger both at him and each other while spengler monitors them through the glass. after recording his readings, he returns to his assistant.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{we'll do the happiness index nexterior}
<P>__{(to dana)}
<D>__{i'd like to bring ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{okay, whatever you think but not venkman.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{oh no.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(affectedly casual)}
<D>__{do you ever see him?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{occasionally}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{how is he these days?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{venkman? i think he was borderline for a while there. then he crossed the border.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{does he ever mention me?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{no. not that i can recall.}
<A>__{they move to another two way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(slightly disappointed)}
<D>__{well, we didn't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when i got married.}
<A>__{the assistant interrupts again.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{we're ready for the affection test.}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(to the assistant)}
<D>__{good. send in the puppy.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i thought of calling him after my marriage ended, but . anyway, i appreciate you're doing this, egon}
<A>__{they watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable cocker spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(handing him a card)}
<D>__{this is my address and telephone number. will you call me?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{certainly.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{egon, i'd rather you didn't mention any of this to peter if you don't mind.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she shakes his hand and exits.}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(to his assistant)}
<D>__{now let's see how she reacts when we take away the puppy}
