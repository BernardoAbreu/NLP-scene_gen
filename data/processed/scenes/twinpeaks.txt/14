<L>__{11. flashback: lil's dance}
<A>__{in slow motion. on lil's sour face}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{lil was wearing a sour face.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. they are not going to be receptive to the fbi.}
<B>__{on lil blinking both eyes}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up... the eyes of the local authority. a sheriff and a deputy. that would be my guess. two of the local law enforcers are going to be a problem.}
<B>__{on lil putting one hand in her pocket and one in a fist}
<C>__{desmond }
<D>__{if you noticed she had one hand in her pocket which means they are hiding something, and the other hand made a fist which means they are going to be belligerent.}
<B>__{on lil walking in place}
<C>__{desmond }
<D>__{lil was walking in place which means there's going to be a lot of legwork involved.}
<B>__{we see cole putting his fingers in front of his face and saying lil}
<A>__{is his sister's girl.}
<C>__{desmond }
<D>__{cole said lil was "his mother's sister's girl". what is missing in that sentence? the uncle.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{oh, the uncle is missing.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime.}
<A>__{on lil's red wig}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{a blue rose.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{very good, but i can't tell you about that.}
<A>__{stanley rides along quietly for a while.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what did gordon's tie mean?}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{what? that's just gordon's bad taste.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{why couldn't he have just told you all these things?}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{he talks loud. and he loves his code.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i see. he does talk loud.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it must be a high priority situation.}
