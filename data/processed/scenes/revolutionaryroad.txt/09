<L>__{interior dressing room night.}
<A>__{frank enters. the chair in front of the mirror is empty. a cigarette burns in the ashtray. frank glances at a standing screen in the corner. april's costume is draped over the top. he goes towards it, deciding what to say.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{april, sweetheart. you were great. i mean it.}
<A>__{the door to the bathroom opens. april enters in street clothes. frank's been talking to an empty room.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{hi. you about ready to leave? i've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go.}
<A>__{she sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at him. frank can see that her face is blotchy from crying. he puts his hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well... i guess it wasn't a triumph or anything, was it?}
<A>__{april looks at him in the mirror. she holds his look just a second. and from her expression, he knows he said exactly the wrong thing.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i guess not. i will be ready in a minute.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{take your time.}
<A>__{he removes his hands and lights a cigarette. april begins to take off her makeup.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{will you do me a favor? milly and shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. will you say we can't? say it's because of the baby sitter or something?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, the thing is, i already said that we could. i mean, i just saw them out there and i said we would.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{oh. then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? that should be simple enough.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't you think that's a little bit rude, april?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well i will tell them myself.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. okay. take it easy. i will tell them.}
<A>__{he backs to the door.}
