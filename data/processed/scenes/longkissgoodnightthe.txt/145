<L>__{interior chapel with charly}
<A>__{charly, semi conscious. rolls onto her back, gasping. stares at the gathered saints. swallows hard. sucking it up, preparing. rolls to one knee, plants her foot... she's got to make that truck. on her feet now. stumbling forward. one arm hugging her guts. cross eyed, so hard to focus... left foot, right foot, get it done, bitch, yes it's supposed to hurt that much, flings open the door and she's so brave that for a second we think she might make it. timothy kicks her in the head. charly flies back. hits and slides. fetches up against a bannister, wham ! timothy calmly shuts the door behind him. consults his tiny gauge 297 degrees.}

<A>__{he sheds his coat. stows his gun. removes a switchblade. drapes the coat on the bannister. flicks open the knife.}

<D>__{oh, honey. only four inches...?}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{you'll feel me.}
