<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{joel walks with his bags behind mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(not looking back)}
<D>__{how are you today?}
<P>__{(at lab)}
<D>__{here we are.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{joel enters. mierzwiak stands there with stan in his lab coat.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{ah, mr. barish. this is stan. he'll be in charge of your procedure tonight.}
<A>__{stan nods professionally.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{mr. barish.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{how exactly is this going to work tonight?}
<A>__{as mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{we'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards there is an emotional core to each of our memories as we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process by the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. like a dream upon waking.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{is there any sort of risk of brain damage?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. nothing you'll miss.}
<A>__{joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment. suddenly he gets it.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's happening now! i'm already in my brain.}
<A>__{mierzwiak looks at the fading room.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{yes, i suppose you are.}
<P>__{(back in his faded memory persona)}
<D>__{so, let's get started if we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.}
<A>__{joel is sitting in a chair. electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by stan. mierzwiak watches from the corner.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{we use the articles you brought to create a map of clementine in your brain. tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{but you're tracing and erasing now. it's already started. i'm home in my bed.}
<A>__{stan pulls a snow globe from one of joel's bags, shows it to joel. the equipment registers joel's reaction.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{stan pulls out a potato dressed as a vegas showgirl. joel studies it. the machines register his response.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{we'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. that way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.}
<A>__{stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of clementine printed on it. joel looks at the cup. the machines record his reaction.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{good. we're getting healthy read outs.}
<A>__{the room, stan, and mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.}
<C>__{stan's voice}
<D>__{patrick, do me a favor }
<A>__{joel is watching stan. stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues.}
<C>__{stan's voice }
<D>__{ and check the voltage levels, i'm not wiping as clean as i would like here.}
<A>__{joel looks up. stan's voice seems to be coming from above.}
