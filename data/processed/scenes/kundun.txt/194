<A>__{the boy sits at the table, writing. we can hear the crowd, shouting, outside the norbulinka walls. we see just a few words of the letter:}
<D>__{please do not resist. take refuge on the far side of the river.}

<L>__{interior altar room night}
<A>__{the chapel of mahakala. we are reminded of secret, sacred moments, from long ago. tenzin gyatso opens the heavy, creaking door. the dalai lama is in disguise. he is wearing the clothes of a khamba guerrilla dark, woolen chuba and tall black boots. monks sit on the floor, chanting. one monk stands by a large urn, ladling out butter for the lamps. tenzin gyatso goes to the front of the room. a monk begins to play the cymbals. another puts the tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long, mournful note. the dalai lama lays a white silk scarf a kata over the shoulders of this imposing statue. then, he sits for a moment. in the weak light, in the black room, tenzin gyatso is lost among the other praying monks.}
