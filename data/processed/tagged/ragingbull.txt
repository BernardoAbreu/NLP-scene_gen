<D>__{so there i am in the can... and not the one that says "gentlemen" on the door. i'm talkin' about jail! down south! i mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. and if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. especially if you're italian... you come from the bronx... and you're an ex champ. as soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... i know i'm in trouble. to me, they got an accent, and to them, i got an accent! you gotta get the picture i'm big, i got small hands, i walk like i'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever i get the chance, i read a lot. so naturally, takin' all this into co sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing i'm queer! now i didn't mind too much when they called me "queer" or "mr. tough guy" or "yankee punk"... but one day these screws got to me... i was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. all of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. i'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! this screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, "well, champ pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?"! they got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! so i look up at him and say, "oh, this tree... it fell on me." and he says, "oh, i'm sorry... if i'd have known, i would've yelled 'timber'" i said, "hey, look... it hurts. i think maybe i broke somethin'!" he says, "well, whaddaya know... champ pimp's got himself a boo boo." then i got as stupid as him. i said, "if i'm champ pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?"! then another screw comes over and says, "this yankee creep givin' you trouble?" what kind of trouble? what am i gonna do hit 'em with the tree? now anybody else in their right mind would've said, "no sir, i wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... i just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as i can." that's anybody else. when i said it... it was a little different. "you stupid cracker... take your hands off me or i will get up and kick your brains out but first you gotta bend over so i can find 'em!" next thing i know i'm in the hole. solitary confinement. all my life i had guys in my corner yellin' "go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! you're the greatest." now there's nobody rootin' for me. but it wasn't so bad. i learned things there. i learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. i never knew how to do that before. now i know. monday is one scratch. tuesday is two scratches. wednesday is three scratches. and so on. except for sundays. sundays is no scratches. sundays rested.}

(slow motion) s) jake wins over cerdan. joey, overenthusiastic, hits jake on the back of the head a little too hard. jake gives joey a quick look, but joey just embraces him. t) on a bed, a girl is going down on joey. the girl turns and looks up at jake. it's linda, the waitress from his club. jake stares. u) jake's fist hits linda's face. v) vickie playfully bends jake's hand back, pretending to break it. w) jake hits linda again. she cries. x) repeat image n: dr. pinto injects novocaine into jake's fists. we see again the image of jake's face as he sits in his cell. the montage continues: y) vickie is in her underwear in a bedroom. a pair of black arms come in and embrace her body. z) close up of jake; he reacts to this. he's in the ring with sugar ray. he knocks sugar ray out of the ring. aa) vickie again. jake approaches her from behind, pulls her head back by her hair, and slaps her. bb) the announcer points to sugar ray as the winner.

'kid, this ain't your night. we're going for the price on wilson.' you 'member that? 'this ain't your night!' my night i coulda taken wilson apart! so what happens? he gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark, and what do i get? a one way ticket to palookaville. i never was no good after that night. it was like a peak you reach. then it went downhill. it was you, charlie. you was my brother, charlie. you shoulda looked out for me a little bit. you shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so i wouldn't have to take them dives for the short end money... you don't understand! i coulda had class. i coulda been a contender. i coulda been somebody instead of a bum, which is what i am. let's face it. it was you, charlie."}
