<A>__{scene #12, interior, day, dining room}
<L>__{1 exterior day w}
<A>__{something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun tains of tennessee, and the camera takes its point of view. rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest. creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path. the tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.}
<L>__{2 exterior day car}
<A>__{near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain. the road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks. from behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard. it is a large logging truck headed south. moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap pears in the distance. from where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 oldsmobile comes into view.}
<L>__{3 interior day car}
<A>__{inside, five people can be seen. they are couples ashly and linda, scott and shelly, and cheryl, ashly's sister. both scott and shelly wear "michigan state" t shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer sity. scott is driving and shelly sits next to him up front. ashly, linda and cheryl are in back. they listen to an old "baby moses and the thrillers" song on the radio, and shelly is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(singing with the music)... together,}
<D>__{forever...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ash, where are we?}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i will tell ya in a second. now we're still on seventy five just past the county border...}
<L>__{4 exterior day w}
<A>__{once again, the camera takes the point of view of the dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge to peer downward. its view focuses upon the 1973 olds mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.}
<L>__{5 interior day car}
<A>__{ashly traces a route on the map with his finger.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{...which would put us...which would put us...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{jesus christ, just tell us already will ya?}
<A>__{ashly zeroes in on the map with his finger.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{...right...}
<A>__{scott is growing impatient.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{...right...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks from scott's hand.}
<L>__{6 exterior day car}
<A>__{the car screetches out of control into the opposite lane. a large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming races toward the car on a collision coarse.}
<L>__{7 interior day car}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{scotty, watch out!}
<L>__{8 exterior day car}
<A>__{the truck races closer.}
<L>__{9 interior day car}
<A>__{their steering wheel is locked.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{turn!}
<L>__{10 exterior day car}
<A>__{at the last possible instant, scott's wheel again can be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its own lane.}
<L>__{11 exterior day car}
<A>__{the truck speeds harmlessly past them.}
<L>__{12 interior day car}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{damn it scott, what the hell was that? you trying to kill us?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{don't yell at me, it's your lousy steering wheel. the damn thing jerked right out of my hand.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i can't understand it. i just had this thing in for a tune up.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{radio's dead too, ace.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{and i just had 'em tune up the whole thing yesterday.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well, then take it back 'cause the damn thing don't work. only thing that works on the whole car is the lousy horn.}
<A>__{scott honks the horn.}
<L>__{13 exterior day car}
<A>__{several local men walking down the highway respond to the horn by waving.}
<L>__{14 interior day car}
<A>__{scott yells out the window at them.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{aw, go to hell, i'm not waving at ya!}
<A>__{he looks in the rear view mirror. the men are still wav ing in the distance. scott turns back to drive.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{shelly turns around in the front seat and holds up a pint of scotch.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{well, i'd like to make a toast. to scott who almost killed us.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{aw, eat shit and die will ya?}
<A>__{shelly and the others laugh.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{okay, okay then to a wild week end in a wonderful cabin with good friends,}
<P>__{(she glances at scott) provided we}
<D>__{live that long.}
<A>__{shelly cooly drinks from the scotch and passes the bottle back to ashly and linda. ashly pours linda a drink in the bottle cap and keeps the bottle. they raise their drinks.}
<D>__{ashly and linda ...with good friends.}
<A>__{they toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ashly tries to hide his reaction to the scotch in front of linda, since shelly had reacted so calmly. ashly passes the bottle to cheryl who stops him with a polite "no, thank you," then back up front to scott.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey scotty, what's this place like anyway?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place, little run down, but it's right up in the mountains totally secluded. (he takes a drink from the bottle) best part is, we get it so cheap.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why are we getting it so cheap?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i don't know, might be in real bad shape.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you mean nobody's seen this place yet?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{might not be too bad.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{actually, it might be very nice.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{it's probably a real pit.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i can't believe that we're renting a place for a week end that nobody's seen.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself) jesus christ,}
<D>__{not this again...}
<C>__{cheryl}
<P>__{(turning to ashly) you know, mom and}
<D>__{dad would never let us go up to a place like this if they knew }
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{ which is exactly why they don't know. i will tell you who i am gonna call. the guys that fixed up this car.}
<L>__{15 exterior day car}
<A>__{the car approaches an exit along the highway.}
<L>__{16 interior day car}
<A>__{ashly glances at the map again.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{hey, i think this is where we get off.}
<L>__{17 exterior day car}
<A>__{the car turns off the main highway and follows several back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that winds upward along a twin set of mountains.}
<L>__{18 interior day car}
<A>__{scott glances up to the peaks.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{these mountains seem familiar.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what do they remind you of? some thing majestic? adventure?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah, more like adventure.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{any adventure in particular?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{shelly's sweater.}
<A>__{ashly and scott laugh out loud. linda laughs quietly, and cheryl lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(teasing) oooh, you're gonna get it}
<D>__{scotty, when you least expect it, you're gonna get it good.}
<L>__{19 exterior day b}
<A>__{finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending over a great chasm. carefully, the vehicle crosses.}
<L>__{20 exterior day cab}
<A>__{it is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their destination. the small wooden cabin is surrounded by thick dark woods. scott shuts off the car but it contin ues to sputter and backfire.}
<L>__{21 interior day car}
<A>__{ashly reacts to his car.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i...i sent 'em a check for the tune up. but i'm just not paying for it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{this place is perfect.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{the woods come awfully close to the house don't they?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{so what's wrong with the woods, they can't bite ya.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{it's just a little claustrophobic that's all.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{well, i think it's beautiful.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{me too, it's gonna be a bomb week end.}
<L>__{22 exterior day cab}
<A>__{scott moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the door. ashly unloads the car to the others.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{it's supposed to be one of these on here.}
<A>__{after trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.}
<L>__{23 interior day m.r.}
<A>__{the interior of the cabin is completely dark. scott opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway for a moment, then enters to find the light switch. the illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings made of cedar. there are two small bedrooms, a kitchen, and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set into the wall. an old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. a door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall. located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar. this catches scott's eye.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hey, this place has a dungeon.}
<A>__{cheryl puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over to scott by the trap door. he unlocks a chain securing the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring to shelly.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{put these back will you?}
<A>__{shelly leaves with the keys, and scott tries to open the hatch but cannot.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{they nailed it shut.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{good, i don't like cellars. probably just some garbage down there anyways.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{cheryl, they don't nail garbage in cellars. i mean it's not going to try and get out or anything.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{well, what's down there?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well, could be any number of things. old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead bodies }
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey, look at this!}
<A>__{linda is standing in the corner next to the old grand father clock. she repositions a balance weight, and it begins to tick.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{ta daaaaaa!}
<A>__{the others applaud and whistle. linda smiles.}
<L>__{24 exterior twilight cab}
<A>__{the cabin is seen from the outside. twilight has come.}
<L>__{25 interior twilight m.r.}
<A>__{cheryl sits alone in the living room near the window. she is drawing sketches of the old clock. as she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly. cheryl puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock. it stands silently in the cor ner with its hands frozen in position. there is a rust ling from the woods. cheryl looks out the window but can see only the trees. something is moving outside, yet re mains hidden within the forest. a gust of wind fills the room. cheryl glances down at her hand. it turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably. she stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad. the wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing. whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them. her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more. cheryl picks up her pad of paper. the likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched. she looks to the woods which are now silent. a snapping of wood is heard from the cellar. cheryl quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. pos sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it. another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar.}
<L>__{26 interior twilight k m.r.}
<A>__{ashly and linda enter from the kitchen. ashly is drink ing a beer and moves over to cheryl. he stands between her and the trap door.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what're you drawing cheryl?}
<A>__{he picks up the piece of paper. linda looks over his shoulder to glance at it.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i...i don't know.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{is it a bible?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{no, no it's no bible. (she glances again at the cellar, knowing some thing is down there) i don't know what it is.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{well, this one of the clock's not bad.}
<A>__{linda picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away. she stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to cheryl and ashly. she is only a few inches from the trap door, and cheryl wants to call out in warning when ashly kneels in front of her to speak secretly.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(in a whisper) i got it right here.}
<A>__{he taps something in his shirt pocket. cheryl is looking past him paying no attention. she watches only linda's feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them. linda looks at the drawing in comparison.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{cheryl, this is really good. i like how you did the numbers in that wood ish style.}
<A>__{ashly produces a small box from his shirt and opens it quickly to show cheryl. it contains a gold pendant on a necklace. linda takes a step closer to the clock. she is now standing almost upon the trap door. although nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with it. cheryl gasps. ashly is pleased with her response.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(still in a whisper) i knew you'd}
<D>__{like it.}
<A>__{quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup rise. linda returns with the sketch and places it back on cheryl's small drawing table.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{it's really good cheryl. very close to the origional.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<P>__{(in a relieved whisper) yes, very}
<D>__{close.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm gonna check dinner.}
<A>__{linda returns to the kitchen and ashly turns to cheryl.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you better get washed up. i will see ya in there.}
<A>__{he winks, then follows linda into the kitchen. cheryl again looks at the cellar. slowly, from her point of view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait ing...waiting.}
<L>__{27 interior twilight k}
<A>__{a blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen. shelly shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.}
<L>__{28 interior twilight d.r.}
<A>__{she joins the others who are now seated at the dinner table and serves the mixture. scott sits between linda and cheryl. he leans over to cheryl.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(in a whisper) dead bodies in the}
<D>__{cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{will you stop it?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{scott, leave her alone will ya?}
<A>__{scott turns toward linda.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{will you relax, i'm just kidding around. she can take a joke }
<A>__{he stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. he turns to see cheryl finish pouring a glass of water in his lap. the others laugh. scott is silent for a moment, then begins chuckling to himself. he turns to cheryl.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(jokingly) i will get ya.}
<A>__{with a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i will get ya for this cheryl.}
<A>__{ashly stands with his drink and raises the glass.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i'd like to make a toast for all here this evening. as a greek friend of mine once said, "nis hat nis fert dis ruben tu tar im."}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{which means?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{party down!}
<A>__{the laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of wood heard from the main room.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<A>__{all stand from the table and hurry to the main room.}
<L>__{29 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{the nails that held down the trap door have been ripped out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open. they stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to what could have done this. cheryl is slighly more nervous than the others. ashly is the first to speak.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(slowly) what is this?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{whatever it is, it's still down there.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i don't like cellars, let's close it up. (she does not want to deal with it) it's probably just some animal.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{an animal?! an an...ha ha ha ha ha that's the stupidest thing i ever heard in my life. jesus christ.}
<A>__{scott locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. he traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{maybe it is just some animal.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah, probably right. it's probably just some animal. uh...cheryl, why don't you make sure.}
<A>__{he hands the flashlight to cheryl who quickly gives it back.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{scotty, i'm not going down there!}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{okay, okay you cowards, i will go.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{scotty don't. you're crazy if you go down there. why don't you wait until morning.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{look, i will be all right.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what melodrama! what courage! a kiss my brave hero.}
<A>__{scott kisses shelly and with flashlight in hand, he descends the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{i, your virgin queen eagerly await the precious moment when you will ascend.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{virgin queen?! ha ha ha ha ha }
<A>__{he disappears below the floor. shelly, cheryl, linda and ashly wait above.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(calling down) hey scott, see any }
<D>__{thing?}
<A>__{there is no answer.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{hey scott!...scott!}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{he's just kidding around.}
<A>__{there is silence.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{isn't he?}
<A>__{no sounds come from the cellar.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{linda, get me a flashlight.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's the only one we brought up.}
<A>__{ashly spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{then get that lantern.}
<A>__{linda brings it over. ashly opens the kerosene valve, lights the wick, and descends into the basement.}
<L>__{30 interior night c}
<A>__{down below, ashly moves quietly past the old stone walls and wooden beams which support the main floor above. in front of him stands an old door which leads to another section of the cellar. cautiously, he moves toward it. before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with a moan. ashly moves through the doorway and deeper into the cellar. condensation from water pipes above turn the cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow pools on the dirt floor below. as ashly scans with his light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{scott?}
<A>__{ashly breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from the area where the shadow passed. he backs sqarely into a pair of arms which grab him.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{it is only scott behind him.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing down here, jerkin' off? how come you didn't answer me?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{just now, i mean upstairs.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh well, did you find anything?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{scott sweeps his light to another corner and reveals several items atop a small table. beneath a dusty cloth, he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the cover. along with this book, scott and ashly uncover a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.}
<L>__{31 exterior night cab}
<A>__{it is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.}
<L>__{32 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{the group sits huddled around the fireplace talking quietly about school. the same bottle of scotch is passed around. ashly is rewinding the tape recorder, and once this is done, he turns it on. the voice of an old man is heard. ashly turns to the others who are talking.}

<A>__{ashly walks to a chair near the other window.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{no. it's not scott. scotty's okay. it's just that ever since we came up here, things have been a little too tense. (he sits) all these crazy things going on. and look at that window we're gonna have to pay for that window now.}

<A>__{lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the small cottage. through the outside window, ashly and linda can be seen embracing. this force watching them moves around the house to another window. the silhouette of scott and shelly undressing can be seen. the force continues around and arrives at cheryl's window. inside, she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window. she stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks at it, then out to the dark woods.}

<A>__{suddenly, cheryl becomes chilled. she folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening. there is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees. cheryl steps into the forest a few feet then stops. a cry deep within the woods can be heard. she freezes. whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard like that of something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth again. cheryl is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her. she stops. no sound. nothing moves. several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. she turns but there is silence again. the winds die down, leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. then, all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement. snake like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs. tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her. the force is now moving through the woods toward her. cheryl is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin. she emerges from the woods and into the clearing. the force is still following.}

<A>__{he is concentrating on the tape.}

<A>__{shelly does not respond.}
<C>__{ashly}

<D>__{did you see her eyes? i'm scared. what's wrong with her?}
<A>__{ashly begins to speak when scott and shelly enter.}
<C>__{scott}

<A>__{cheryl's hand clutches the pen tightly.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{look at her eyes.}
<A>__{scott's hand reaches for cheryl's eyes to inspect them, but they blink open. the pen in her hand races upward, then slashes down, ripping into linda's achilles tendon. linda screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied pen is raised again. ashly grabs cheryl's arm stopping her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining arm at linda who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor. cheryl then clutches ashly and, almost lifting him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight. shelly stands screaming as cheryl now advances toward ashly's face with the bloody pen. he struggles to pull himself out but cannot. cheryl is almost upon him when scott grabs her from behind. effortlessly, she tosses him off and moves toward ashly again. scott climbs to his feet and grabs the axe. cheryl raises the pen above ashly's face, and scott gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle. cheryl stumbles past linda and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. she begins to climb out but scott slams the trap door shut upon her hand. it won't close. cheryl starts to push the trap door open from below. scott climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. demented screams and moans are heard from below as cheryl's hand is finally pulled back and scott manages to secure the chain across the hatch.}
<L>__{57 interior night lb}
<A>__{later that evening, linda is seen in her bed, sleeping. ashly covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks to the door, closing it quietly behind him.}
<L>__{58 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly joins scott and shelly who sit near the fire in the main room. from the cellar, strange moans, sobs and laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from cheryl's breathing. through the next sequence of dialogue, her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{she'll be okay ash, she just took a bad bump.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(quietly) yeah.}
<A>__{scott and shelly listen to the strange noises from below as ashly looks out the window to the woods beyond.}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{i don't know.}

<A>__{ashly and scott are quiet.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{what about her eyes? (desperately)}
<D>__{for god's sake what happened to her eyes?!}
<A>__{cheryl patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the trap door. her head is slightly tilted as she watches and listens to what is said above. from her point of view we hear scott speak to shelly.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{everything's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{cheryl's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow liquid drools out between her teeth. she grins.}
<L>__{59 exterior night cab}
<A>__{outside, the forest is very dark. the unseen force moves from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs as it advances. the cottage comes into view and the evil entity glides up to it. the figure of a girl in the cabin window can be seen looking out. the force stops and moves behind a bush.}
<L>__{60 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{inside, shelly is studying the woods.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{scotty, i...i think there's some thing out there.}

<A>__{shelly heads to her bedroom. scott walks back to the fireplace and sits. he slices twigs from a branch with the sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ashly glances at the book of the dead, then to the old clock. it stands silent.}
<L>__{63 exterior night cab}
<A>__{again, the evil entity watches from outside. it sees shelly leave one room and turn the lights on in another. she begins to undress near the window. the force now moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous speed to shelly who is looking out her bedroom window. she sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.}
<L>__{64 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{a noise is heard from shelly's bedroom. scott drops the small stick he was whittling and looks up. he places the dagger on the floor and walks toward shelly's room.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{shelly, are you okay?}
<A>__{she does not answer. scott approaches her door and turns to ashly.}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{shelly?}
<A>__{he pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. scott turns back to the bedroom when shelly steps into the doorway, posessed. with a scream, she latches upon scott. her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at scott's face and clothes with her nails.}
<L>__{67 interior night s.b.}
<A>__{screaming, scott stumbles through her bedroom with shelly still upon him biting at his throat.}
<L>__{68 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{they stagger into the main room where scott manages to knock shelly off himself and into the fireplace. she remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot coals. scott rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her out. shelly's face and hair on one side of her head are seared and blackened. she blinks her eyes open, turns her charred head to scott, and speaks in a rasp.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{thank you. i don't know what i would have done if i had remained on the hot coals burning my pretty flesh. you have pretty skin give it to us!}
<A>__{cackling, shelly clutches scott's neck and begins throttl ing the life out of him with a vice like grip. he tries to break the hold but cannot. ashly also tries but with a backhand blow, shelly knocks him into a cabinet, smash ing it to bits. a garbled cry for help escapes from scott's frothing mouth. shelly reaches down, picks up the sumarian dagger, and holding scott by his throat with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other. ashly, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. scott grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings his camping knife from its side sheath and slices deep into shelly's raised wrist, almost severing it. a murky black ooze pumps from the wound. she emits an ear splitting howl and tightens her grip on scott's throat. he drops the hunting knife. ashly watches terrified, unable to move as shelly raises her dangling hand (still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and bites it off. the useless part falls to the floor with the dagger still firmly in its fist. scott, now almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming the blade into her spine. shelly screetches along with cheryl in the cellar, the old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all at the same instant. shelly reaches around with her remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife protruding from her own back. a thick black ooze pours from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ashly stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move. black ooze runs from shelly's mouth as her body writhes about spasmatically upon the floor. gradually, the move ments cease and she is dead. as scott slowly stands to his feet, shelly's arm grabs his leg.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hit it!}
<A>__{scott screams this as he backs toward ashly who stands with the axe, paralyzed. gurgling black ooze, shelly advances toward them with one remaining arm. scott grabs the axe from ashly, pushes him away and slams it into her. lightning flashes, thunder booms, and cheryl screams from the cellar. scott brings his axe down again and again in a frenzy. then, after the final chop, there is silence. shelly's body remains on the floor for quite some time until ashly can cope with the fact that she is dead and something must be done.}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah.}

<L>__{74 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly closes the door and turns back to the main room. he sees cheryl's eyes through the crack in the cellar. she has been watching all of this through a space be tween the trap door and floor. ashly walks past her to linda's room.}

<D>__{is shelly okay too ash?}
<A>__{ashly can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. he speaks in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.}

<C>__{linda}
<P>__{ash, i love you. (she turns over)}
<C>__{ashly}

<A>__{ashly closes the door behind him and the fear from a few hours ago engulfs him once more.}
<L>__{76 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly moves into the main room and stops dead in his tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you lied to her. you lied to linda. shelly's not sleeping. she's dead. don't you know the difference? you killed her. you and scott cut her up with the axe. she's dead ha ha ha ha ha ha }
<A>__{ashly picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap door. cheryl is silent from below for a moment, then the hatch opens an inch or so. (the length of the chain securing it) cheyl's white eyes can be seen again.}

<D>__{ha ha ha ha ha ha }
<A>__{ashly takes the axe and steps outside.}
<L>__{77 exterior night cab}

<L>__{81 interior night l.b.}
<A>__{she is still asleep. quietly, so as not to wake her, ashly pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. he re moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. as he does this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in credible speed. ashly looks up to see if linda is still sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. she lets out a low growl.}
<L>__{82 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly jolts backwards out of her room to escape through the front door. he steps outside and stops to look back in. he can see the main room, but finds it difficult to see in linda's room, being lost in the shadows. something ragged and bloody grabs him. it is scott's mutilated body ripped and torn to shreds. he is still alive. ashly looks behind him through the door to linda's room. he can barely make out linda who sits on the bed watching him with glaring white eyes. ashly helps scott to the couch so he can sit. scott is in agony and can barely speak.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ash, i think i'm dying. jesus, i can't feel my legs.}
<C>__{ashly}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<A>__{he looks off into linda's bedroom again, but she is gone. she is now sitting in the corner of the main room where ashly is, watching him. scott begins to cough with hor rible rasping sounds.}

<A>__{his sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain. blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over grabbing his stomach. linda begins to laugh. ashly looks to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{she continues to laugh. cheryl in the cellar joins in the laughter. ashly walks to linda and slaps her but she continues. he grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety and places the barrels against linda's head.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{god forgive me linda.}
<A>__{the laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. it is linda again. ashly puts down the rifle.}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{cheryl?}
<A>__{there is no reply from the cellar. ashly looks through the crack but sees only darkness. he reaches for the chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something wrong, he stops.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{cheryl?}
<A>__{he puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight est sound. cheryl's arms rip through the floor boards and grab ashly's head. he breaks away and her hand reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. slowly it withdraws beneath the floor.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<P>__{(a little too sweet) ash, what are you}
<D>__{doing? this is your sister cheryl. don't you recognize me?}
<A>__{her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from the celler.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(crying and yelling to the cellar)}
<D>__{you bastards! why are you doing this? why?}
<A>__{there is silence for a moment. laughter from behind him begins again. it is linda. her eyes are white once more, and she laughs at ashly.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh...linda.}
<A>__{with newly found courage, ashly angrily grabs linda by the legs and drags her outside.}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{please ash, please.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you'll get better you'll see.}
<A>__{linda's laughter is faintly heard outside. ashly moves to the window and pulls back the curtain. linda is no longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear ing, watching ashly with her glowing white eyes.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be better and we'll both get out of here tomorrow.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{there is no tomorrow! you you've got to kill her and cut cut her up your sister too.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{no, that was only with shelly. you had to with shelly. you linda loves me. you're delirious i...i will get you some water.}
<A>__{ashly places a glass to scott's lips.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{now, now the sun will be up in an hour or so and we'll get out of here ...together. you, me, linda, shelly n no not shelly, she we'll all go home together. wouldn't you like to be going home? you'd like that i'd bet, wouldn't ya?}
<A>__{there is no answer from scott. the water runs out of his mouth.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{...scott.}
<A>__{scott is dead. linda's laughter is heard again. ashly walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. there is nothing there. he turns and she is there! with the sumarian dagger, linda rips into ashly's shirt, cutting his arm. he screams and watches in horror as she runs her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it. she turns her attention toward ashly again but he grabs her and they struggle. linda backs ashly up against scott, knocking his body to the floor. cheryl's gnarled arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and grabs at ashly's foot. he manages to turn linda's arm so the knife is behind her back. forcefully, ashly pushes her over the body of scott and she falls back ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. the blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach. lightning flashes, thunder roars, and linda screams in a deep growl once, then all is quiet. ashly drags linda's corpse past the crumpled body of scott, past cheryl, who watches all of this from below, through the back door and out to the work shed.}
<L>__{85 interior night w.s.}
<A>__{he lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body to it with a number of chains which hang from nails along the wall. he rips down a tarp hanging on the wall to reveal a chain saw. he starts it up and moves toward her. buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a position several inches above linda's neck. ashly looks into linda's face. her eyes have gone back to blue. he turns off the saw.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(in a whisper) linda...}
<A>__{he drops the saw and breaks down crying over linda's body.}
<L>__{86 exterior night cab}
<A>__{an evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ashly carries linda's body outside for burial. he lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel. harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ashly digs linda's grave. she lies on her back during the digging. one of her eyes opens. it is white. ashly drops the shovel and looks at her. she appears to be dead.}
<L>__{87 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{inside the cabin, cheryl begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again. she wants out. the screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen.}
<L>__{88 exterior night cab}
<A>__{ashly places linda's corpse in the grave, oblivious to cheryl's pounding. he begins to cover her with dirt.}
<L>__{89 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{cheryl has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact.}
<L>__{90 exterior night cab}
<A>__{ashly glances to the grave and sees linda's necklace on top of the dirt mound. he reaches down to pick it up when linda's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him! she pulls herself up out of the grave scream ing and clutches ashly's leg with a black and bloodied hand. he twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go. by now, linda is almost completely out of the grave. with her fingernails, she rips into ashly's leg, tearing his skin. screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. she grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws ashly log and all, away from her. ashly hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with. thick black ooze pours from linda's nose and mouth as she turns toward ashly sprawled on the ground.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{stay back.}
<A>__{his hand gropes for the handle of the spade. linda advances toward him, laughing.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{linda please, if you can still hear me. keep away.}
<A>__{his fingers tighten on the wooden handle. with a scream, she lunges toward him. from the ground, ashly swings the spade upward, lopping off her head. the head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk ing about spasmatically. thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ashly manages to pull himself out from underneath the body. he backs away in disgust and falls. he picks himself up again and sees linda's necklace upon the ground. ashly stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin.}
<L>__{91 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{inside, he looks to the main room beyond scott's body.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh.....}
<A>__{it is a moan from deep inside him. the trap door is open and cheryl is gone. ashly walks over and kicks it shut. a slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing shelly's bedroom door to creak open. ashly picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.}
<L>__{92 interior night s.b.}
<A>__{he enters. the room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze. ashly moves toward it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. only clothes are inside. he turns toward the other end of the room and cheryl pops up in the window right by him. he swings and fires, shattering the window. cheryl backs away and spots the open front door.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{the door...}
<A>__{he makes a mad dash through shelly's room.}
<L>__{93 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{in the main room, ashly races for the door.}
<L>__{94 exterior night cab}
<A>__{outside, cheryl is almost upon the door.}
<L>__{95 interior night mr}
<A>__{ashly arrives in time, but cheryl has already started reaching in. he slams the door on her fingers and rams his gun butt down upon them. horrible screams are heard as cheryl withdraws her hand. ashly is able to slam the door and bolt it. he runs to the back entrance lead ing to the shed and locks it also. on his way back to the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. it is his last shell.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(to himself) more shells. where did}
<D>__{i see that box of shells?}
<L>__{96 interior night c}
<A>__{from the basement, the trap door lifts open and ashly decends. the bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his weight, and ashly sprawls to the floor. slowly, he picks himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway beneath the water pipes to a small table. on it, he finds the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun. he ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.}
<L>__{97 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{the sound of ticking catches ashly's attention. he looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back wards. he watches and waits tensely. turning carefully, ashly tries to monitor all the windows. the ticking grows louder. a shadow passes in the window before him and he fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor. ashly waits, leaning against the front door for something to happen. he is tense and more determined than ever to survive. he whispers to himself.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{c'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this?}
<A>__{placing his hand to his side, ashly discovers something in his pocket. he lifts it to his eyes. it is linda's necklace.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{...linda. (he whispers)}
<A>__{the ticking stops. he tilts his head for the slightest sound. all is silent. from behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him. ashly tears away and falls to the floor. the necklace is tossed away in the confusion. cheryl's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door. from the floor, ashly raises his rifle and fires at her head.}
<L>__{98 exterior night cab}
<A>__{clutching at her face and screaming horribly, cheryl is jolted from the door.}
<L>__{99 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly places a dresser and chair against the holes in the door. behind ashly, scott's corpse sits up and opens its white eyes. it stands and moves toward ashly. he turns with the gun, but scott knocks it out of his hands. desperately, ashly grabs a table lamp and shatters it across scott's head, then jams the exposed socket into his face, shocking him. scott staggers back several steps, then continues after ashly.}
<L>__{100 exterior night cab}
<A>__{outside, cheryl is now pounding against the front door.}
<L>__{101 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{ashly picks up a small table upon which are the book of the dead, and the professors journal. he throws it at scott. this does not affect him, and he advances closer. the book of the dead lands near the fireplace and edges of the paper darken from the heat. scott picks up ashly and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. the front door begins to give under cheryl's pounding. ashly brings his hands to scott's eyes. with a crash, cheryl breaks through the front door and begins to push the dresser away. pages from the book of the dead are smolder ing now. ashly jams his fingers into scott's eyes and slips from the grip. scott clutches his eye sockets and his back begins to smolder. ashly now sees the book. its pages burn at the edge. cheryl topples the dresser and enters the room. her face is partially torn away from the shot gun blast. ashly rushes to throw the book onto the burning logs, but cheryl, smoldering also, gives him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent sprawling to the floor. she grabs a fireplace poker with her crushed fingers and turns back to ashly who is crawl ing toward the fireplace. when almost in reach of the book, scott grabs his leg and begins to pull ashly back ward. cheryl approaches with smoke pouring from her clothes and slams ashly across the back with her poker. ashly screams. a glitter catches his eye. it is linda's necklace. grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp toward the book. it slides off the cover. scott pulls him back once more as ashly swings the necklace in a last desperate attempt. cheryl raises the poker for the final blow. the necklace drapes over the book and as ashly is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls the book with him. with a yank, he seizes the book and tosses it upon the blaze. cheryl and scott freeze. the book of the dead burns in a bluish green flame. smoke pours from scott and cheryl as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods. the fireplace poker slips from cheryl's hand and sticks into the wood scarcely an inch from ashly's head. the bodies of scott and cheryl then begin to cave inward upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering heaps. finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies once were. the old clock begins to tick again, normally. ashly slowly climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. open ing his hand, he looks down at linda's necklace. the force retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the darkness from which it emerged. gradually, the natural sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as autumn colors return. the first rays of sunlight gleam over the woods beyond the cabin. daybreak has finally come.}
