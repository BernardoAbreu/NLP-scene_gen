<A>__{sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying the philosophy of time travel book. it's quiet and peaceful, and everything's bathed in golden light.}
<L>__{exterior lookout, vietnam tom's squatting ground sunset}
<A>__{she comes upon tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area near the lookout, and looks around before approaching. when she sees the handmade bunny mask lying among his things, she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up. she runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and jagged teeth... she doesn't realize that tom is standing close behind her. when she senses his presence she's startled.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry...}
<A>__{she sets the bunny mask down where she found it. tom says nothing. he seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her there. he walks up beside her and sits, facing the view. after a long beat, sam sits down beside him. to her surprise, tom begins to speak:}
<C>__{vietnam tom}
<D>__{my mom told me someday everybody would understand. she said it was my job to look out for the town... so that's what i do. that's what i always do.}
<A>__{sam listens to him intently.}
<C>__{vietnam tom }
<D>__{they don't know why. they don't even want me here, but i still have to protect them.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they're lucky to have someone to protect them.}
<C>__{vietnam tom}
<D>__{i'm used to it... i'm lucky to have a job to do. some people don't have any reason to be here at all.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know what you mean...}
<A>__{tom turns and looks at her strangely.}
<C>__{vietnam tom}
<D>__{you're more important than all of us.}
<A>__{sam peers into tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask. without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask... when she starts to pull it off tom grabs her hand, stopping her not too rough, but forceful. sam's scared for a moment, but tom lets her go. his eyes drift down to the philosophy of time travel book by her side. sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him. when tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with emotion. sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{do you like to read?}
<A>__{tom says nothing.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you can borrow it...}
<A>__{again, tom does not speak. after a beat, sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving tom with the book.}
