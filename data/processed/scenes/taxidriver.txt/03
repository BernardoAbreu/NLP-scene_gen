<A>__{to ongoing conversation between the middle aged personnel officer and a young man standing in front on his desk. the young man is travis bickle. he wears his jeans, boots and army jacket. he takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette. the personnel officer is beat and exhausted: he arrives at work exhausted. travis is something else again. his intense steely gaze is enough to jar even the personnel officer out of his workaday boredom.}
