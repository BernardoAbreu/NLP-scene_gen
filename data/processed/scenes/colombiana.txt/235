<A>__{cat walks through the house like it could be a trap, a silencer in her hand. her senses are keening, she is that alert. and then she finds the first body. mama. dead. a bullet in her head. cat has all she can do to keep it together. then she finds pepe, a bullet in his head. it is almost too much for her to bear. and then she finds emilio, tied to a chair, tortured. to death. this is too much for her to bear. cat cuts emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently takes him in her arms. and begins to cry.}
