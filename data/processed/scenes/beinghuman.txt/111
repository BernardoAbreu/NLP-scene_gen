<L>__{exterior dunes morning}
<A>__{hector is enjoying the freshness of the day. we see him climb over a dune and then as he nears the summit duck and retreat down the slope again. cautiously he crawls up the dune and looks over to the other side. he is watching a young girl and the boy nuno. they are twelve or thirteen years old. they are coyly in the early stages of making love, the boy lying close to the girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. their love making is poised oddly between child's play and eroticism. it's their day of discovery and it is like a dream of love. the boy is just about to discover some more and is fumbling with the girl's clothing, when he looks up and catches sight of hector. hector ducks down but knows he has been seen and decides to brazen it out. he stands up in full view of them.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{stop that... leave her alone... get back to the camp... or i will tell your mother... how can you play like this when there are people needing your help back there...?}
<A>__{the boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. he walks off back to the camp. the girl remains sitting in the sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise her head to hector. then hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop in the boy's shoulder or the girl's lowered head. hector realizes he has broken something precious and in their circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. he feels like an oaf. he calls after the boy.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{come back... i didn't mean it... it was a joke... you come back... she's still here... i won't say anything...}
<A>__{but the boy walks on, turning around now and then to look at hector, who feels foolish and mean. hector calls down to the girl.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{but she doesn't look up, still fumbling with her buttons. hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes, angry with himself. then he sees the procession of the native king and his people, some cattle, and porters carrying baskets. hector runs off towards the camp.}
