<A>__{the beefy "arms" of plant 42 undulate overhead as chris and his companions look for an exit.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{th this thing was no accident. it was cultivated!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{and it didn't rip out the ceiling for the fun of it. stay alert.}
<A>__{the plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. the pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals. chris spots a doorway.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{as the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in front of rebecca, and doesn't withdraw. it hovers there. its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers of cartilage that look like teeth. inside, a pulsing calyx emits a pistil that twitches and swells.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{my mother made me eat vegetables. i know 'em all. this ain't one of 'em.}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{aiken...}
<A>__{another pod swoops down on sullivan's back. its beak clamps onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. it's pistil shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within the blink of an eye, sucks out every ounce of the man's blood. his skin turns the color of parchment, flaking off him like powder, as he dies.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{sullivan! jesus, sullivan!}
<A>__{aiken rushes to his buddy's side.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{get out of the away!}
<A>__{chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one of the gardens. leaping up, he grabs one of the sparking conduits and pulls it down.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{get outa there, aiken!}
<A>__{chris ends up having to shoulder aiken out of the way. tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but chris manages to jam the semi rigid conduit into a pool of sprinkler fed water around the plant's roots. a bright current stutters through every vine. the plant shrieks, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to squirt from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms", and into its blood sucking pods...which flop, lifeless, to the floor, with the same sort of liquid smacks that human skulls might make.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{they.. .they killed sullivan. the bastards... whoever did this shit... they killed sullivan!}
<A>__{enraged, aiken draws a long bladed knife and wildly attacks the remains of plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs, not stopping until he cuts into... ...something that looks like a vine...but bleeds red! aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's coiled in high tree branches. it's the oversized body... ...of a copperhead, with a belly six feet in diameter. as aiken gasps, spellbound, he's stuck from behind. the snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the greenhouse, but its head is on the other. with the power of a dozer shovel..jaws like the open hood of a cadillac... teeth the size of windows...clamp onto aiken's mid section, instantly crushing his ribs. chris finds a skein of rope. he throws the long end over a ceiling beam, then instantly makes a lasso out of the piece in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head . aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss. chris throws again. in the seconds between tosses, the snake has slurped aiken into its mouth. the rope encircles the beast's head. chris pulls. the noose slips down over the snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. chris uses all his strength. with the ceiling beam as a pulley, the snake's head is slammed against the rafters.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(to rebecca) hold this.}
<A>__{rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{get in here, soldier!}
<A>__{in this crisis, chris finds himself sounding a lot like wesker. it sobers him. it sobers rebecca, as well. she rushes in and takes hold of the rope. moving fast, chris rushes to where aiken's knife dropped on the floor. he grabs it, turns back, and sees... ...something moving inside the snake's beaded torso. it's aiken... still alive. chris charges, plunges the knife into the beast, hacking through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody cavity. aiken is curled within, like jonah in the whale. his chest has been crushed to half its normal size. acids from the monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands, his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze out words.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{k kill me. s sullvan said...i'd be.. .better off dead. that...ain't never been truer than now. kill me!}
<A>__{the snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the ceiling. rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's lifted, bodily, off the floor. the rope snaps, cut by the steel beam. rebecca falls. the trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. it delays the snake for two seconds. those fragile seconds give chris just enough time to reach into the open belly of the monster...and pull the pins on two grenades that dangle from aiken's vest. the giant copperhead snaps at chris from behind, missing him by inches. he dives, like a wide receiver reaching for a pass. what he catches is... ...rebecca's arm. his momentum carries her down to the floor. they roll behind another stone wall that contains tons of earth, which protects them from... ...boo booooom!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow aiken... and yards of the snake's mid section...into eternity.}
