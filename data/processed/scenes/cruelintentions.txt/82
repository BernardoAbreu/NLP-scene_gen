<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know. that's the amazing part of it. i mean, it wasn't like cirque du soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. i'm going to sound like a hallmark card.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{no, tell me.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.}
<C>__{kathryn}
