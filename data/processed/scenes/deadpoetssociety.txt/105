<D>__{read!}
<A>__{as cameron begins to read, keating looks out at todd as he puts his scarf on. todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{"understanding poetry by dr. j evans pritchard, ph.d. to fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)..."}
<A>__{the door squeaks as keating shuts it behind him. cameron pauses.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{"... how important is that objective? question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. and once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. if the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph "}
<A>__{keating passes by todd and the others and gets to the back of the classroom before todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.}
