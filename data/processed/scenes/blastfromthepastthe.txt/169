<A>__{lights are low and warm. adam is attempting to swab the abrasion on eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat pants.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{she reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip, revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other. it stings and she flinches.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{steady. steady. it's going to be all right in no time.}
<A>__{he leans down and blows on the wound. cu of that. cu of his hand on her calf. cu of her looking down at him, watching as he blows gently on her knee.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i went to sophie's and she was very hospitable.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{is that what you call it?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but it just wasn't where i wanted to be so i left as politely as i could and found a taxi. but i asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. there's a song mister como sings called "on the street where you live." you know it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{sing it to me.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(softly, saying it as much as singing it)}
<D>__{"all at once am i several stories high knowing i'm on the street where you live." it's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.}
<A>__{she reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length. then:}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{adam...dumb question, but humor me. have you ever had sex before?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she sits up.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{how is that possible?}
<A>__{during the following speech camera pushes past him and lingers on her as she gradually realizes that adam is mental.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{in 1962, when the bomb was dropped on los angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. that's where i was born. we only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. my father worked on it secretly for years. when he had to, he used contractors, but always from out of state and always for just a portion of the job. he told them it was a secret government experiment done through caltech. my dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty five years. that's also why i have no brothers or sisters. the air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. what i'd like to do eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. we could live there with my mom and dad. my dad said if i found a healthy girl i should "bring her on down". and you look plenty healthy to me.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{uh huh. adam?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, eve?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i want you to go back to the hotel now. i will call you a cab.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{of course. i shouldn't be over here at this hour.}
<A>__{he rises. she gets up and leads him to the door.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's right. and i will see you in the morning in the lobby. do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{not at all. and eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. my first.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it was at least as good as the sky.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{really? okay!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{and i think better than the ocean. i'm serious!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{neat. goodnight!}
