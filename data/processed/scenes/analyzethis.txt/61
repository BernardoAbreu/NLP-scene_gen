<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{my father. he was a big man in the neighborhood very well respected. everybody loved him, god rest his soul.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he passed away?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no, i just like saying 'god rest his soul.' yeah, he passed away. he died when i was about twelve.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{heart attack. sudden thing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{were you and your father close?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{close? yeah, you know, pretty close. i guess we weren't getting along that great right then.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why was that?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i was hangin' out in the neighborhood. i had a borghata like a kid gang hooligan shit, nothin' big. but my father didn't like it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you fought about it?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{he slapped the shit out of me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and then?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{and then that night he died.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how did that feel?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{it felt great! how did it feel?}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, think about it. were you angry, were you afraid? sad?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, i guess.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{any feelings of guilt?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{about what? i didn't kill him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm just speculating, but maybe in some way you wanted him to die.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{why would i want my father to die?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, you said you were fighting. you were rebelling against his authority. there may have been some unresolved oedipal conflict.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{english.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oedipus was a greek king who killed his father and married his mother.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{fuckin' greeks.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's an instinctual developmental drive. the young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{are you saying i wanted to fuck my mother?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's a primal fantasy }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{have you seen my mother? that is the sickest fucking thing i've ever heard.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's freud.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{well, then freud's a sick fuck, and you are too for bringing it up.}
