<A>__{a man in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. he finds andy's package, rips it open. pulls out the black ledger and files. scans a cover letter. holy shit. he dashes to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the glass: "portland daily bugle editor in chief."}

<L>__{int shawshank prison day (1966)}
<A>__{norton walks slowly toward his office. dazed. the morning paper in his hand. he goes wordlessly past the duty guard into his office. shuts the door. lays the paper on his desk. the headline reads: "corruption and murder at shawshank." below that, the sub headline: "d.a. has ledger. indictments expected." norton looks up as sirens swell in the distance.}
