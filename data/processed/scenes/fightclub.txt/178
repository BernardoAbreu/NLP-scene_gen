<L>__{interior kitchen moments later}
<A>__{jack sits at the table, sips coffee. he's pale, dazed, seems broken. he hears the faint sound of sawing and hammering, unsure of where it's coming from. marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter. her back is to jack as he looks at her. she pours ccffee and lights a cigarette. a beat of silence, then:}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{i will be out of your way in a sec.}
<A>__{she seems to be as weak as jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you... don't have to... leave.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{really... i mean it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{have you been going to your groups?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{chloe's dead.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{do you care?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{it was the smart move on her part.}
<A>__{marla turns to face jack, a grim expression on her face. there's a bruise on her arm. jack gets up, moves closer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why are we both... caught up like this... with... ?}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i came so close to saying tyler's name, i could feel it vibrate inside my mouth.}
<A>__{marla looks a him, waiting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't understand. why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{what do you get out of it?}
<A>__{faint sound of sawing and hammering. jack can't quite figure where it's coming from.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you hear that?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{hear what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that... sawing and hammering.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{have we been talking too long? must we change the subject?}
<A>__{jack turns through the crack of the open basement door, tyler's staring at jack from the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(harsh whisper)}
<D>__{you're not talking about me, are you?}
<A>__{jack reacts, turns back to marla.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to marla and tyler)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{that day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(still a whisper)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to marla and tyler)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{nothing? i don't think so.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{this conversation...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this conversation...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{... is over.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{... is over.}
<A>__{marla comes to touch jack's hair. jack closes the basement door. marla sees the kiss scar on jack's hand, grabs his hand. jack tries to pull it back, but marla keeps a grip.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{what is this? who did this?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{... a person.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{guy or girl?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{why would you get bent if i asked?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let go of me...}
<P>__{(pulls his hand free)}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you're afraid to say.}
<A>__{marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with frustration. she leaves out the back door, not looking back. jack leans against the wall. after a moment, he opens the basement door, heads downstairs...}
