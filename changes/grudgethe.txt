<ACTION>__{on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The sound of wind, and rippling cloth. Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly. Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed? No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her. Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.}
<CHAR>__{MARIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey.     Are you okay?}
<ACTION>__{Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward towards an OPEN WINDOW. There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly, almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles. Maria gets out of bed, concerned.}
<CHAR>__{MARIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Peter?    What's the matter?}
<ACTION>__{He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her. His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank. Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window. Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below. Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL -- -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head has burst open, his body broken and twisted. ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see -- -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS. A translation appears over them: "The Grudge."}

<ACTION>__{A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas. Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.}

<DIAL>__{Karen!}
<ACTION>__{She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American) approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand -- -- and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.}

<ACTION>__{He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on. She sees the smile on his lips a moment before -- -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all. It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But then she pulls away, shy.}

She looks underneath the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything. She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around. Nothing. Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining... She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small cut on her finger.

She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence. Then -- SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from. And then she notices something strange about the closet door: It's been sealed shut with duct tape. The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby. And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there? Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside -- The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf. Karen reaches inside and picks it up. Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her. Karen slides the door the rest of the way open -- -- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.

Nothing but darkness beyond. Doug closes the door and turns away from it, wondering why he's here, what he's looking for. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone. Speed-dials Karen's number. As he raises it to his ear -- -- he doesn't notice the door to the rear room SLOWLY SWINGING OPEN BEHIND HIM --}

<DIAL>__{Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm still at school...}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(under his breath)}
<DIAL>__{Guess your mom's late, huh?}
<ACTION>__{Then Toshio suddenly looks up.   Right at Karen. Following Toshio's gaze, Peter quickly turns to face Karen. But even though she's right there, he doesn't see her: She's seeing something that happened three years ago. As if sensing her presence, Peter walks right to the edge of the stairs, looking down. Then: A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway. Peter turns towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall.}
<LOC>__{129 INT. THE HOUSE - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something near the door -- -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's personal work space. Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS. Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT. KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one. Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet. He opens it. HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words... ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we recognize, that she's written repeatedly -- -- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it. Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl, KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading. Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces. A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet. Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up. THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA. It's clear they're having a great time with one another... ...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face. And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face. Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards, against the wall. In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way. She can't understand how this could be happening. As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters down from above, landing on the floor in front of him. It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn- out photographs. Peter slowly looks up to see -- -- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES. And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them. It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces. Karen watches, terrified, as Peter reaches out a hand -- -- and slides the door open. He immediately recoils.    A terrible stench inside. The BUZZING of the flies is louder.    Coming from above. Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket.    Lights one. And looks up. HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open. Peter reaches up to open it fully -- -- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down. She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle. Peter backs away in horror --}
<LOC>__{INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard. Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD. It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before. Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Toshio!   We have to --}
<ACTION>__{He stops short at the door, as he sees -- -- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head, tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips. He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair. TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall.}

<ACTION>__{Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs.}
<LOC>__{131 INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door, passing a mirror -- -- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he passed. Something wrong. He takes a step back and looks -- -- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO. Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her. As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as -- A SERIES OF IMAGES, THE ORIGIN OF "THE GRUDGE", FLASH BY: -- TAKEO, looking down at THE JOURNAL, reading his wife's words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see KAYAKO, home from work, standing in the doorway... -- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her, he wraps his hands around her neck... -- KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO, her son, watching through the bars of the second floor railing as... -- TAKEO snaps Kayako's neck with an audible CRACK... -- KAYAKO, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as... -- TAKEO drowns a flailing TOSHIO in the bathroom tub... -- TAKEO tears apart TOSHIO'S CAT, still alive, in the bathroom sink... -- KAYAKO letting out a HORRIBLE CROAKING, the only sound her broken neck can emit, as TAKEO advances on her with a knife, his eyes filled with a manic madness... -- TAKEO in THE ATTIC, stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO, both very dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner... -- KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO'S ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS... Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm...}

<ACTION>__{We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR -- It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow. We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter. Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the revelation taking everything out of her. A beat.   Then:}
<DIAL>__{That came from upstairs.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THUMP.}

<DIAL>__{No more... please, no more...}
<ACTION>__{She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness-- -- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in abject terror -- -- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right next to her all along.}
<CHAR>__{KAREN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{DOUG!   NO!!!}
<ACTION>__{Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above, growing closer. But it's no use -- he's dead. And now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. A familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND, along with a strange SKITTERING, like the world's biggest cockroach. Karen turns to the staircase to see -- -- KAYAKO, crawling down the stairs. Still wrapped in the plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward -- -- her eyes locked on Karen, CROAKING horribly -- Karen sorrow turns to abject terror. She tries to lift Doug's body and pull it to the front door. It's too heavy. And KAYAKO is getting closer. Sobbing, Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front door, bumping into -- THE GAS CANS. The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER, spilling gasoline into the entryway. As Doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched HAND lands next to Karen. She sees something clenched in his fingers -- -- his ZIPPO LIGHTER. Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling onto her hands. The odor is unmistakable. Karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen Doug's grip on the lighter as -- -- Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. Her broken neck makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen. Karen finally gets the lighter. She pushes back against the door with legs too numb to stand. Her eyes drift up to see -- -- TOSHIO, watching from the railing above, as before, his cold eyes locked on hers. Karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off. She tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas. Kayako doesn't seem to care. She crawls over Doug's body and pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing inexorably closer -- Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUG'S LIGHTER. She flicks it.   Nothing. Karen tries the lighter again.     And again.   Nothing. Kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth -- The lighter CATCHES. Karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door -- -- just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE. Karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame -- -- but she can't pull herself free, as -- -- Kayako pulls herself closer, her CROAKING intensifying -- -- resigned, Karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can -- -- and ignites the gas!
