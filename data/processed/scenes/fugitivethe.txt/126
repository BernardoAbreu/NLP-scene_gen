<L>__{interior conduit day}
<A>__{biggs and renfro. sweeping his light as he advances. searching for splash patterns.}
<C>__{biggs}
<P>__{(into shoulder mike)}
<D>__{nothing yet.}

<A>__{gerard. probing a branch off tunnel with his light. about to pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the branch off tunnel. hand marks?}
<C>__{gerard}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{got a possible here. stand by.}
<A>__{he stows his light but hangs onto the glock. bracing with three limbs}
<L>__{interior downslope conduit day}
<A>__{gerard begins the tricky descent. slips once. recovers. slips again... ... and tumbles out of control. gun and radio clatter away. scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags an overhead pipe. gerard stabilizes. sweeps his light to locate his glock, lying down tunnel. he eases toward it. but another hand gets there first. it's kimble. face dark and desperate. dangerous. hand flexing on the pistol. they lock eyes for a beat.}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{i didn't kill my wife.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{so, you didn't kill your wife.}
<A>__{not my problem. an adrenal beat. for a moment they hold a look. then the silence is broken by gerard's radio.}
<C>__{biggs }
<D>__{gerard? you there?}
<A>__{gerard looks for his radio, then back at kimble he's gone. instantly gerard reaches for his ankle and pulls a back up piece.}
