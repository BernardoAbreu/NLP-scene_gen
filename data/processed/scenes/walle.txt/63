<L>__{interior captain's quarters same}
<A>__{the captain sits by his window to space. holds a toy axiom model over his globe of earth.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{[rocket noises] prepare for landing... [landing noises] we're here everybody! yeah, captain! [crowd cheers] captain we're home! it's so beautiful! [crowd cheers]...no it's nothing. i was pleased to do it. it's all about you people }
<B>__{on trash can}
<A>__{noises. eve bursts out from it, like an angel. blows the lid off. the captain is stunned by this vision. she opens her chest to reveal... ...the plant.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{how...? how'd you find it?!}
<A>__{eve hovers over to him. salutes. formally presents him the plant. he takes it in his hands. still potted in the old boot. gazes at it in wonder.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we can go back home...for the first time!}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what's it like now?}
<A>__{eve shrugs. doesn't know how to answer.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no, no! don't tell me! i want to see for myself!}
<A>__{he turns to his console. hits a button. a cylindrical device rises from a panel. the captain sticks it to the side of eve's head. a holographic screen projects from the device. plays back images of her time on earth. a collage of images rapidly scroll past. all displayed from eve's pov: ...being delivered to earth... ...flying above the devastated landscape... ...blowing up a rock... ...scans of numerous trash locations...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{wait...that doesn't look like earth... where's the blue sky...}
<A>__{he looks over to his computer screen. the beauty images of earth still on display. compares them with what plays on eve's screen.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{...where's the grass?}
<A>__{his face drops. slumps in defeat. the dream is over. on eve's holographic screen the hello dolly clip of poysc plays... it stirs the captain out of his funk. he looks up at the screen. leans in for a closer look.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{...i know that song...}
<P>__{(observes the dancers' feet)}
<D>__{and they're... dancing. yes, dancing!}
<A>__{a rueful smile grows on his face. he looks down at}
<B>__{his foot}
<A>__{it's tapping in time to the music. his gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands. he lifts it up. makes the boot dance.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{...you made it somehow, eh little guy? you didn't give up, did you?}
<A>__{as if in response, the plant wilts slightly. a leaf drops.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(gasp!) oh no, no (remembers)}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{the captain urgently hovers across the room. eve left alone. her recorded memories continue playing... ...the clip changes to it only takes a moment. eve recognizes the music. watches the lovers on screen hold hands. something familiar about the gesture... looks at her own hands. slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...eve's eyes go wide. this is what wall e was trying to say to her. her memories continue on the screen: ...a tap on the shoulder... ...wall e presents her the plant ...the screen goes black! then... ...security camera footage initiates. wall e's vigil for eve plays out: ...protecting her from the rain... ...the sun...the sandstorm... ...keeping watch night and day... ...trying to jump start her heart...}
<B>__{on eve}
<A>__{amazed at wall e's selfless dedication to her. realizes the meaning of wall e's love.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{wall e...}
<A>__{she looks at her hands again.}
