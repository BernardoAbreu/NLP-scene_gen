<A>__{neo reaches back and puts his hands on either side of smiths head. as hes being pummeled from the front, he squeezes and screams. his screams are mixed with smiths. the agents head deforms as were hear a sickening crack. suddenly, the body reverts back to that of the original owner, a security guard, and the head simply explodes. the hold broken, neo stumbles back over the body, with the three smiths in pursuit. he somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps to the left, putting one smith in front of the other two. he attacks, his killing blows destroying smith, smashing through his blocks. he falls, and neo takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of them away in one shot. as he comes down, a wall of smiths converges from all sides. they stop, leaving a circle around him. we pan back to view a sea of black suited smiths flooding the plaza. cu: neo as his hand passes over his face, it is refreshed, anew, perfect again. he surveys the wall to wall smiths. smith talks with his voice, times a thousand.}
