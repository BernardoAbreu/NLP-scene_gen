<L>__{interior q's lab night}
<A>__{a scot in a kilt plays the bagpipes badly. he spins round, drops the pipe from his mouth, simultaneously fires bullets from one pipe and a jet of flame from another. the target is a realistic dummy now a molten, bullet ridden mess. we're in q's laboratory. he's walking bond through.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{scottish heavy metal, q?}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{oh pipe down, 007.}
<P>__{(irritated, hands over a watch)}
<D>__{your 29th. try not to lose this one. it has dual lasers and a miniature grappling hook with fifty feet of high tensile micro filament, able to support 800 pounds.}
<A>__{in the background, we see a man in a sleek black jacket. the man pulls a string...the jacket becomes an airbag...it envelopes him, he gets impossibly tangled in it. q ignores it, handing bond a new pair of glasses.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{new refinement. sort of x ray vision. for checking concealed weapons.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{and other uses, no doubt.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{abuses in your case. you destroyed my hydro boat in less than seven minutes, as no doubt will be the case with this...}
<A>__{he presses a button and a section of ceiling lowers to reveal a bmw z7. a man in a white coat is loading a missile into one of the headlamps, then steps off the platform. q gestures to him.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{007, my deputy assistant. i'm grooming him to follow me.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(to man)}
<D>__{that would make you..."r"?}
<C>__{r}
<D>__{ahh, the rampant 007 wit. i, of course, am laughing inside. but i dare say you've met your match in this machine.}
<P>__{(touring the car)}
<D>__{the absolute latest in intercepts, surveillance and countermeasures. titanium plating and armor, a multi tasking heads up display. completely indestructible. all in all, rather stocked.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{'fully loaded' i think is the term.}
<A>__{"r" pats the fender, he's pretty damned fond of his machine.}
<C>__{r}
<D>__{do take good care of her.}
