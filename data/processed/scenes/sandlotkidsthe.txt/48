<T>__{dreamy dissolve to: the story of the beast:}
<L>__{exterior "mertle's acres" day}
<A>__{a legendary place... benefitting from years of kid embellishment: a gothic, scrapyard fortress oddly designed to keep something in not out.}
<C>__{squints }
<D>__{the beast belongs to mr. mertle, the guy that used to own mertle's acres junkyard. and nobody's ever seen him since the day it happened...}
<L>__{interior mertle's acres day}
<A>__{blurbling pockets of super heated muck.}
<D>__{burned out shells}
<A>__{of twisted vehicles strewn carcasses. a battlefield.}
<C>__{old appliances}
<A>__{that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses.}
<C>__{squints }
<D>__{mertle's acres was a bitchin' place, that had everything you could ever imagine.}
<C>__{other stuff}
<A>__{like savaged shopping carts. a school bus graveyard. scrap motorbikes. cargo ship buoy balls. the gutted shell of a fighter plane.}
<D>__{squints (v.o.) (cont'd) and the stuff was worth a fortune. so, one day mr. mertle got him this new pup from the pound. they were glad to get rid of him, on account of while he'd been there, he'd killed three dogs bigger than he was.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that was exactly what mr. mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard, 'cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn't around.}
<B>__{we drift through}
<A>__{a maze of dark, grimy junk passageways.}
<D>__{squints (v.o.) (cont'd) so he bought the beast, and set him loose in mertle's acres.}
<B>__{something lopes by}
<A>__{at the end of a passage. (note: we never fully see the beast.)}
<D>__{squints (v.o.) (cont'd) the beast was still just a pup of six months, but he already weighed a 150 pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.}
<B>__{a trash bag}
<A>__{full of meat hits the ground disappears. slifftht! it spits back into frame... empty and tattered.}
<D>__{squints (v.o.) (cont'd) he threw the beast a trash bag full of meat every night, and just left him alone. all alone in the whole place by himself... to grow.}
<C>__{an eyeball}
<A>__{among a pile of broken headlights. as big as the headlights.}
<B>__{fleeting glimpses of more stuff}
<A>__{like mannequins, with bite chunks missing. plastic flamingoes, brutally mangled. a decapitated "lawn jockey." a plastic cow, legs gnawed off. and breathing... amongst the artificial "life" forms.}
<B>__{a gargantuan footprint}
<A>__{in the center of an old truck tire. the beast's shoulders moving powerfully as tall as a burned out vw.}
<D>__{squints (v.o.) (cont'd) and so, in a few months, the pup grew into the beast. and he grew big as a car. and he grew mean, 'cause nobody liked him, and he didn't like nobody either.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and so he only had one thing on his mind... to kill.}
