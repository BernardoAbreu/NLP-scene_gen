<A>__{early morning. the branches of the trees are encapsulated in ice. the snow piled ten inches on every surface. maurice, buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around. his breath materializes with every step. he forces a weak smile at the magical landscape before him. white. pure. peaceful. the sounds of a volvo station wagon urges maurice to the side of the road. as it passes a little girl waves from the passenger window. maurice puts on a brave face and waves back. another car enters the picture a dark blue firebird rises over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast. slow motion as the firebird skids over the ice and the snow the driver desperately trying to gain control... the mother in the volvo hits the brakes as the firebird spins into her lane... maurice yells out.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the cars impact with a sickening crunch back to real time: the firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow. the volvo isn't so lucky. it flips from the impact... sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the road... it comes to a rest a hundred feet away. silence. stillness. the entire event took only seconds. maurice runs frantically after the volvo. the windows are shattered. snow has packed into the over turned car. no one can be seen inside the vehicle. maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand. his arm disappears up to the shoulder. his face grimacing with the strain. his arm comes out slowly... a few muffled sobs are heard before the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window. she lets out a desperate gasp for air as maurice pulls her out by the wrist. maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.}

<D>__{it's okay. it's all over.}
<A>__{maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to the other side of the car.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{is she okay?}
<A>__{maurice looks up to see the driver of the firebird walking towards him. he looks dazed. maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in the snow... deeper than before. his cheek pressed against the snow, almost laying flat on the ground.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{oh no... she's wearing a seat belt.}
<A>__{maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... he lets out a powerful grunt as he pulls back with all his strength a woman's wrist appears first, then the tangled hair and then the body spills out onto the road next to maurice. the driver appears over the woman and maurice and loses it when he sees them.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{it wasn't my fault. it wasn't my fault.}
<A>__{maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth no movement. no sound.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{come on... please...}
<A>__{maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth...}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{please...}
