<D>__{boy, it stunk in there.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i believe it. you've ruined a nine hundred dollar suit my dad gave me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{guys like me, huh. well, listen, even though i've been celibate lately, i'm not gonna force myself on you. i've never done that in my life.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you wouldn't have time anyway. we come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{if they get set up in time, which i doubt. and even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a ford.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.}
<A>__{more bumps. then picking up speed as the road smooths out.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{who, buddy? yeah. he's a good guy. back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail. she's a born again christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{buddy. that's his given name?}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(woops, beat)}
