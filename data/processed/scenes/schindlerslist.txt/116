<L>__{interior goeth's villa night}
<A>__{the rosner brothers in evening clothes, leo on accordion, henry on violin, playing a strauss melody, trying to keep it muted, inoffensive. few of the guests pay attention, which is fine with them. an ss officer chats with schindler.}
<C>__{leo john}
<D>__{ she's seventy years old, she's been there forever they bomb her house. everything's gone. the furniture, everything.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(well aware the man is lying)}
<D>__{thank god she wasn't there.}
<A>__{schindler, with yet another girl on his arm, endures the officer's lies while sweeping the room with his eyes.}
<C>__{leo john}
<D>__{i was thinking maybe you could help her out. some plates and mugs, some stew pots, i don't know. say half a gross of everything?}
<A>__{schindler looks at him for the first time, knowingly.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{she run an orphanage, your aunt?}
<C>__{leo john}
<D>__{she's old. what she can't use maybe she can sell.}
<A>__{schindler's girl excuses herself to get a drink.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you want it sent directly to her or through you?}
<C>__{leo john}
<D>__{through me, i think. i'd like to enclose a card.}
<A>__{schindler nods, done. both watch his date across the room getting a drink. as usual, she's the best looking on there.}
<C>__{leo john}
<D>__{your wife must be a sainterior}
<A>__{whatever tolerance schindler's had up to this point with john leaves his face; the looks he gives him now is pure contempt.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{she is.}
