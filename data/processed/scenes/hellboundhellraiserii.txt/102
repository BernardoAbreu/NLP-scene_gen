<L>__{interior the centre of hell}
<A>__{malahide and julia are at the end of a corridor. they turn into an open space. a vast open space. it is desert like in its expanse, almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest reaches. it is criss crossed by catwalks, on one of which malahide and julia now stand. beside these catwalks, the ground falls away into mile deep, dark, abysses. above the catwalks, dominating the huge space, is the master of the labyrinth. the master, leviathan, is a monumentally huge, white, multi faceted diamond, spinning on its own axis, entirely unsupported by any physical means, above its territory. apart from its very immensity, the most unsettling thing about leviathan are the beams of black light that shine out from the corners of all its many facets. due to the fast spinning, these beams shoot and swoop around the chamber, like a negative laser display of dazzling complexity. the sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified. it is the sound of leviathan's breath. malahide has walked the last few yards like a man in shock. now a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash before his eyes at almost subliminal speed. his face suddenly crumbles into an expression of incredulous terror, he makes a noise halfway between screaming and retching, and drops to his knees by the edge of the catwalk. unfortunately, this allows him to look down into leviathan's pit. looking down with him, we are given a sudden and vertiginously sickening realization of hell's immensities. there is a drop of miles visible down the pit and, all the way down, as far as the eye can see, there are other catwalks cutting across the pit at various angles. malahide looks back up, his scream renewed by his sight of the pit. two or three of the beams of black light flit across his face, filling his eyes with more subliminal images of horror as they pass; a child, a knife, and a dead animal; a naked woman whose private parts are made of sharp, oily, metal; perfect hands ending in crumbling, leprous fingers. suddenly, leviathan stops spinning. effortlessly. instantly. two more beams are projected at malahide but, as they come within a few yards of him, they become writhing pink limbs that fly out, sieze malahide and lift him into the air. he screams out.}

<D>__{no! no! julia! help me!}
<A>__{malahide is held in the air as julia replies.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{but you wanted this. you wanted to see. you wanted to know. and here it is. the heart of hell. leviathan.}
<A>__{as she says this two of the thing's facets part to reveal a raw and gaping cavity lined with angry, sore looking purple flesh directly behind the dangling malahide. the purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart and open in various places to reveal blades, hooks and needles at the end of various vestigial limbs. the limbs holding malahide draw him back inexorably into this cavity. he has one last moment to meet julia's eyes.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why do you think i was allowed to go back? for you? no, it wanted souls. and i brought you. and you wanted to know. now you're both happy.}
<A>__{malahide is now held within the walls of the gash. he opens his mouth for one final scream but one of the tiny needle topped limbs flies at his mouth and sews his lips together with heavy blue wire before he can utter it. his eyes widen in both agony and horror. julia smiles.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{goodbye, doctor. it's been real.}
<A>__{the gash heals itself, closing malahide within. despite the gash having closed over malahide, the leathery flesh that covers that area is a mass of movement, ripples and bumps. small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface, allowing us occasional and partial glimpses of malahide and what is happening to him. at one stage malahide's hand and forearm appear. a long deep, running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peeled and folded back, revealing the meat and the muscle beneath. as we watch, two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps of flesh, still folded back, to the rest of the arm, leaving the wound open and un healable. another gash opens and malahide's face is visible. here too the needles are at work, diving into and out of his flesh in a complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled together beneath one ear, leaving malahide's features permanently pulled out of shape and decorated with running stitches of metal wire. again, malahide's torso appears, naked. two large triangular blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest. two different limbs appear but these have sucker like tips rather than metallic ones. they fasten onto the new cuts, as if battening. instead they are injecting as becomes apparent when malahide's skin turns blue. the blueness, the conscious disfigurement, and the almost decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what is happening to malahide is not simply torture; he is being transformed into a cenobite. julia watches with avid interest.}
