<L>__{exterior elias and barnes' jungle day}
<A>__{barnes moving, stops, listens. something is running towards him. but it's hidden by the bush. he brings his rifle up smooth and quick, waits, then as the bush parts, elias is standing there. looking at barnes. barnes sees him, starts to lower his rifle, but then stops. he raises it back an inch, sights it. pause. a cold searing look of hatred coming over his face. in that moment, elias understands. quick as a deer, he makes his move, trying to plunge back into the bush. barnes fires. once, twice, three times the blast rocking the jungle. elias jerking backwards into the bush, mortally wounded. bird cries. a crime against nature. barnes calmly lowers his rifle, and walks away from it.}
