<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{five more minutes. hear me? and you'd better not }
<A>__{a sound behind him. butterfield wheels round. on the ground beside the open car door, the instruments.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{what the fuck are you playing at?}

<A>__{butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. the track is silent, but for butterfield's shallow breath. he reaches out to touch nix^s fingers... closer... closer... he touches the hand and the wall of sand comes down with a roar! he jumps back as nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the mask rolls into view.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{oh christ! oh christ!}
<C>__{butterfield}
<P>__{(reverentially)}
<D>__{it's him... it's him.}
