<L>__{interior ecker's crusader day}
<A>__{the ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam. ecker checks the altimeter: 150 feet. a small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up like tree limbs. the crusader rockets over it. ecker checks his instruments. out the window, the other crusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin cruisers, the small craft traffic outside key west. the speed sucks the breath away.}

<D>__{shit! me too!}

<A>__{two of the crusaders pull up, away from the water.}
<P>__{pilot #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{oh, god damn. got it restarted.}
<P>__{pilot #2 (o.s.)}
