<A>__{they're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep. the only light in the room comes from the open windows. he rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her adoringly. he slips off the chain with the gold coin. slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it rest there. she opens her eyes and looks at him, wondering if he senses something.}

<D>__{i'm putting you on the coin... your essence... that way you'll always be with me when i dive.}
<A>__{she smiles, closes her eyes. he swings the coin over her face gently, some kind of private ceremony. she looks just a little intimidated. the coin is now dangling in front of her mouth. she hesitates then opens her mouth, jacques lets the coin slide into it.}
