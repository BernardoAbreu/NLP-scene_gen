<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the reliquary is dangling. anya reaches up to grab on to it but her aim is off and she hits it. the reliquary flies and smashes against the side of the tower, shattering. rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away in terror.}

<A>__{who climb back up to the platform.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{of the eiffel tower as the evil spirits from the reliquary burst out. the spirits take on all the forms we've seen earlier: bears, minions, snakes, and combinations of all. they grow and swirl, with hideous moaning noises. anya and dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.}
<B>__{on rasputin}
<A>__{as the spirits begin to swarm around him, a tornado of horrid beings. re screams as they pull him off the ground.}
<B>__{on anya and dmitri}
<A>__{as the force of the tornado increases, they have to hold on to the girders and each other in order not to be sucked in. bartok is thrown against the side of the tower and slithers to the floor.}
<B>__{on rasputin}
<A>__{suspended over the eiffel tower in the maelstrom. he screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment him and explode pieces fly and disintegrate in mid air, in wild colors and smoke.}
<B>__{on dmitri and anya}
<A>__{who hug each other in relief. they stand, looking out. the smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.}
<B>__{on bartok}
<A>__{who rises, patting his chest he's about to let out a bartokism... but all the emerges are little bat squeaks. he's surprised as first, then thrilled. the spell is broken and he's just a bat again.}
<B>__{dmitri and anya}
<A>__{as he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off her head in the fight. he hands it to her.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{come on... i will take you home.}
<A>__{anya looks lovingly at dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i am home.}
<A>__{"hone is where you are" (the love duet for anya and dmitri). a simple emotional ballad for two people who realize at last that their hearts have led then to each other, to "home". this will work within the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but can also be re recorded as a pop single. the song continues over various scenes:}
<B>__{the empty stage}
<A>__{tatiana smiling, knowingly. sophie & vladimir sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party. xenia and estelle look at each other with their stone faces.. . and smile.}
<B>__{bartok}
<A>__{hanging from the rafters of the eiffel tower, no sure what to do next then a cute female bat flies up next to his and "bats" her eyes. anya & dmitri walking over the river bridge with meetoo following behind them... a family going home together.}
