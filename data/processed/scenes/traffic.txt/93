<L>__{exterior wakefield house night}
<A>__{a large, well maintained colonial on mockingbird valley road, an upper middle class neighborhood in the wealthy east end of cincinnati. leaves fall on the saab wagon in the driveway.}
<L>__{interior robert's study night}
<A>__{robert is looking at caroline and he's not happy. barbara is there, at a neutral distance from both of them.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{caroline? how well did you know this boy who overdosed?}
<A>__{she looks up beseechingly.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he didn't hang around us. he's like one of those hippie kids. i'm not part of that group. it was a party in all these rooms. his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical... he's blue, he's puking... we didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, what would you have done if you had been us?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{how well do you know this boy, seth, who was driving? you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he's a friend. he's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation. he'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive. we didn't know what else to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it wasn't my pot.}
<A>__{she searches her parents' faces. it has been a convincing performance and she expects victory.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{okay, honey. we understand. you're mother and i have to talk.}
<A>__{caroline is confused by this reaction.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{honey, we'd like to talk alone.}
<A>__{caroline stands abruptly }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{like always.}
<A>__{caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than necessary. robert and barbara look at each other, raising their eyebrows and breathing deeply }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i think she's lying.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{me, too.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(reaching a decision)}
<D>__{we'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. school and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. this has to be handled delicately. dan kelly, in the district attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. christ, this could be embarrassing.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. i tried }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{stop. you experimented in college. i don't want to hear about that.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{this is different.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{to begin with, she's only sixteen years old.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i think she has to find out for herself, on her own. we have to allow her space }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{space for what? to o.d. like that other kid? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents. because it isn't. correct?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we don't want to push her away. these are growing experiences.}
<A>__{robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{how long have you known about this?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{how long have you known?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{six months. i found some marijuana, that's all. and a little pipe about two inches long. i talked with her. she said her friends smoked pot and drank }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{explain to me how you could think that i shouldn't know about this. explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me. as a parent.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{she asked me not to.}
<A>__{he leaves the room.}
