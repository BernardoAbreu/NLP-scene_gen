<L>__{exterior gas station afternoon}
<A>__{a can of coke clatters down the chute of a drink dispenser. jenny picks it up and, with the star man hovering at her shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. he watches a quarter disappear into the slot and when jenny picks another one out of her purse, he points to it.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{money.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she inserts the quarter and makes her selection. a reese's peanut butter cup drops from its position into the pickup bin.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{candy.}
<A>__{using the change from this and another quarter, she selects an almond joy.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(as it tumbles into the bin)}
<D>__{money... candy.}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(to the star man)}
<D>__{that'll be fifteen fifty, sir.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{she hands him a twenty.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he goes to make change.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{jenny pops the top on the coke can and on the way to the car takes a sip.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what is...}
<P>__{(reads off the can)}
<D>__{...coke?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{a drink.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(holds his hand out for it)}
<D>__{i...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you want to try it?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i want to try it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this stuff could kill...}
<P>__{(changes her mind and smiles)}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<A>__{the star man fills his mouth, swirls it around and swallows.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(after a loud burp)}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{he hands the can back to jenny. she looks at it and knows there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to meet.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{eh... you keep it. i've had enough.}
<A>__{the star man takes another drink. he stops dead when he lowers the can. jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes he isn't with her. she looks back over her shoulder. her eyes go immediately to where he is looking. the license plate pxv 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the mustang. jenny decides to brazen it out.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(throws the can to the ground)}
<D>__{shit!}
