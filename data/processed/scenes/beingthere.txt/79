<L>__{interior rand's bedroom day}
<A>__{rand is in bed. eve, chance and allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side. they all watch the president's address to the financial institute on tv. chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. rand is looking weaker. every so often, allenby casts a concerned glance his way.}
<C>__{president's voice}
<D>__{... and there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. and there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. well, let me tell you, gentlemen, i have been conducting multiple level consultations with members of the cabinet, house and senate. i have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. and this very morning i had an in depth discussion with your founder and chairman of the board, mr. benjamin turnbull rand and his close friend and advisor mr. chauncey gardiner...}
<A>__{rand perks up a bit at this mention. allenby manages a smile, once again looks at rand, checking his condition. eve looks proudly at chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.}
<C>__{president's voice }
<D>__{... well, gentlemen, i found this to be a most rewarding conference... to quote mr. gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'as long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'}
<A>__{rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside. allenby shoots a quick look to eve and chance.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(motioning toward door)}
<D>__{excuse us, please.}
<A>__{eve and chance leave the room as allenby administers aid to rand.}
<C>__{president's voice}
<D>__{gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer. as in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit.}
