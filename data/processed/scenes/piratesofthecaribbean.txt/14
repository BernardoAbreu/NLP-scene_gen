<D>__{i believe thanks are in order.}
<A>__{jack takes norrington's hand gingerly. they shake and norrington tightens his grip, yanks jack's arm toward him, then tears back the sleeve of jack's shirt exposing a brand on jack's inner wrist: a large 'p.'}

<D>__{i half expected it to be made of wood.}
<A>__{he slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to mullroy.}

<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.}
<A>__{gillette snaps the manacles closed on jack's wrists.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but it seems to be enough to condemn him.}
<C>__{norrington}
<P>__{(smiles)}

<A>__{now that jack is safely chained, norrington nods to his men. all but one stow their weapons, and two step forward }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{finally.}
<A>__{lightning quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks. the pistol sails into the water. before anyone can react to that, jack has the manacle chain wrapped around elizabeth's throat. pistols are drawn again, but now elizabeth serves as a shield. norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.}
