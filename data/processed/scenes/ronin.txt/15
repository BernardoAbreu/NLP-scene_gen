<T>__{a time cut to:}
<L>__{interior the bar later}
<A>__{the bartender is wiping out a last glass. when this is finished he looks up at a table in the back where our five guys have relocated. now the bartender and vincent exchange a look, and then the bartender takes out a set of keys and tosses them through the air and they smwack into vincent's hand. the bartender and vincent speak in rapid fire french, and then the bartender is gone. sam turns to vincent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he trusts you to lock up?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{let's just say he knows who i am.}
<A>__{vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them around the table again, nobody takes on. vincent seems really disappointed by this.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting for?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(lighting his cigarette)}
<D>__{the question isn't what we're waiting for... it's who.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and who the fuck is that?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{whoever hired us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i got this gig through a contractor. and he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...}
<A>__{there's a kind of general look around the table a nod or grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men were hired the same way.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing his thought)}
<D>__{so none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. for all we know, we're working for different people.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{now that is an interesting proposition.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.}
<P>__{(with great meaning)}
<D>__{your orders might be different from mine.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what're you talking about, man? i don't understand.}
<C>__{swede}
<P>__{(quietly, but loud enough to be heard)}
<D>__{what a surprise...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i got a surprise for you, blondie...}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(sharply, as if he's used to giving orders)}
<D>__{why don't both of you shut up? larry & swede}
<P>__{(to gregor at the same time)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{knock it off!}
<A>__{there is a beat. gregor, swede and larry look at sam, who glares them all down. lastly, sam turns and looks at vincent. the two men nod at one another, acknowledging a kind of mutual respect.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the point remains: we could be working for different people. there's a chance for one of us...}
<P>__{(looks around the table)}
<D>__{maybe more than one of us has been paid to cross the others. i don't know about you guys, but i like to know who i'm working for. it can help prevent a great deal of...}
<P>__{(finding the right word)}
<D>__{...unpleasantness.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(patting the gun inside his cheap suit)}
<D>__{anybody tries to unpleasant me i will put two between his eyes one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.}
<A>__{from off screen we hear a new sound: laughter. another angle deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last exchange.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{it's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(staring at larry)}
<D>__{the name is deirdre, and i'm running this show.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{who are you? ira?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(with a brittle laugh)}
<D>__{not likely. once, yeah, i was but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and i'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. i'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.}
<A>__{deirdre hands out several thick envelopes. larry and swede open theirs and stare at the wads of franc notes stuffed inside. even gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his money. but neither vincent nor sam takes a look.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{from here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.}
<P>__{(a quick beat, then she looks at gregor)}
<D>__{you. what do you do and what should we call you?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{these days they they call me gregor and i'm a tech. i do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.}
<A>__{deirdre turns to sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam. i'm a weapons guy.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you were a soldier, were you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{once.}
<A>__{deirdre gives sam a look and he returns it. finally, deirdre turns to larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i drive and my name is larry. larry from the states.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(she turns to vincent)}
<D>__{and who are you?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm vincent. and i coordinate.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{coordinate what?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{things. this is my country, you know.}
<A>__{the two men exchange another look. a pecking order is developing among the group: vincent and sam are both natural leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.}
<P>__{(vincent doesn't respond for a moment)}
<D>__{are we in sync on this, vincent?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{deirdre waits a beat, letting vincent know what she isn't any more intimidated by him than he is by her. finally, she turns to swede.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{they call me swede.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who's they?}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{everybody.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{and what is it you do?}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{me?}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{i kill.}
