<L>__{exterior gary's house night}
<A>__{the music echoes from inside. push past a line of cars and limousines in the lit up drive, milo's car at the head of it. milo and alice get out. as they go inside, she pulls a tag from the sleeve of his just bought dinner jacket.}
<L>__{interior gary's house entrance hall continuous}
<A>__{as milo and alice enter, he sees a balthus painting re digitize to a mondrian.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{they called the house to ask who's your favorite painter.}
<A>__{alice smiles, milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to sneak away, now. they pass a doorway where a houseman stands, to keep guests from entering residential rooms (the ones milo must pass through to get to gary's workroom). a guy in a pretentiously hip tux tries to peek in.}
<C>__{houseman}
<D>__{sorry, sir, this part of the residence is restricted.}
<A>__{milo looks a little more tense... party room a moment later the room is full of people. a long windowed wall has been opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more guests drink and chat, and an orchestra plays. a giant mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest id card. milo sinks a little more. across the room, gary, his wife (a blandly pretty blond) and two men are grouped around a monet set on an antique easel (thus clearly the real thing; mrs. boyd has prevailed.) gary notices the giant digital mondrian. milo takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. he hands one to alice as gary et. al. approach.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{alice, i'm gary. this is my wife, clarissa.}
<P>__{(handshakes, etc.)}
<D>__{milo, this is barry linder, who's visiting from hollywood.}
<A>__{linder is a short, tan man of 50.}
<C>__{linder}
<D>__{i hate being the hollywood guy. it's so limiting. meet my friend, ricky.}
<A>__{ricky is 25 years old; he looks like a polo model.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{hi, guys.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{barry's studio's gonna help fill the skywire pipeline, thought you guys should meet.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(his mind elsewhere)}
<D>__{cool.}
<A>__{angle: the orchestra, playing. angle: a group of society types chatting.}
<C>__{society woman}
<D>__{he's a sweetheart. he gave 10,000 pc's to the library association.}
<C>__{society man}
<D>__{all 10,000 of which will be signed onto his browser, no doubt.}
<C>__{society woman}
<D>__{and so what?!}
<C>__{another man}
<D>__{wait'll all the books are on line.}
<C>__{society woman}
<D>__{and so what?}
<A>__{angle: milo, alice, gary, barry linder, clarissa, ricky. milo looks utterly preoccupied...}
<C>__{linder}
<D>__{the merchandising implications are epic. a kid's watching the movie, he points and clicks at the laser blaster before the reel's even over he's ordered the toy.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{but, i mean devil's advocate won't that influence the content? won't the artists complain? the directors or writers or whoever?}
<C>__{linder}
<D>__{artists? darling, the only art left in america is business. you're in picasso's house!}
<A>__{gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except milo; he hasn't heard any of it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{where's the bathroom?}
<C>__{linder}
<D>__{the irreverence!}
<A>__{laughter. track milo as he wends his way through laughing, chatting guests, dread and determination on his face. he moves away from us, enters the}
<B>__{entrance hall}
<A>__{speaks to the houseman who guards the residential rooms.}
<C>__{houseman}
<D>__{you'll have to use one over there.}
<A>__{he indicates an area on milo's side of the door.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{there's like eight women waiting in line. they take forever.}
<P>__{(winces: painful bladder)}
<D>__{please?}
<C>__{houseman}
<D>__{right here.}
<A>__{he points to a door immediately behind him. as the houseman watches, milo goes into the}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{he stands there a moment, breathes deeply. he cracks open the door. the houseman is turning away another guest; milo makes his move. den like room continuous looking over his shoulder, milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room, silently cursing the mondrian that inevitably appears. the houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom door, assumes milo's still inside.}
