<L>__{exterior george nelson's beach shack day}
<A>__{george is shirtless in his front yard, hand hewing a twenty foot beam. one strong, long pull and a thin shaving flutters to the ground; guster nabs it and starts to chew.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you'll crap real logs if you keep eating wood.}
<A>__{guster appears unconcerned as he awaits a new shaving.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{hi, mr. nelson.}
<A>__{george glances up, wipes the sweat from his forehead as alyssa walks toward him in white shorts and a tee shirt.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{sorry i got you into trouble.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will survive.}
<A>__{george goes back to works and guster taste tests shavings as alyssa searches for something else to say.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{does sam have any friends?}
<A>__{george stops and looks up; he has no idea how to answer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he must.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{he seems lonely.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{are you his friend?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{marilyn manson...and i guess he's into guys. i hate nose rings. and the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.}
<A>__{george is totally confused, unsure most of the answer, but before he can question her, a police car pulls to a stop; officer kurt walker steps out.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{thought i'd run over the list.}
<A>__{officer walker removes a pad from his pocket and flips through to find his place.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{this is such a street of whiners.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{from tuesday to yesterday, not including monday or today. okay...mrs. dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn. the corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{ipo's caused the rat population on this street.}
<A>__{officer walker focuses on alyssa.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{and of course the beck's, with the...}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it could have been a squirt gun.}
<C>__{kurt}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{you've been good this week.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you forgot david dokos and tom and barbara.}
<A>__{kurt stuffs his pad back into his pocket.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{mr. dokos calls animal control for guster and i was out here on the other.}
<P>__{(pointing to the plane)}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<A>__{george hands him the plane and kurt begins to work the wood.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{are you guys' friends?}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{we've known each other since grade school.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? listen to music? masturbate together? talk on the phone?}
<A>__{george doesn't answer and kurt keeps working.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{hunted rabbit in the hills.}
<A>__{alyssa stares at george, disappointed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i aimed high.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{we just weren't very much alike, i guess. i don't know.}
<P>__{(casually; to george)}
<D>__{i liked your dad more than i liked you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i wouldn't want you as a friend.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{george just never really...aimed that high. even with not hitting a rabbit. i knew you were doing that, by the way. that's why i stopped doing it with you. you were no fun. it was always like you were frightened. quiet and boring.}
<A>__{kurt is beginning to perspire as he shaves food off the beam for guster.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{he builds models for architects. his dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. designed and built the coolest houses i've ever seen.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{left you this place.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{do you know what i'd give to have this! forget how i got it! i can't afford dirt in this town. i live in riverside, goddammitt and you get to piss in the ocean.}
<A>__{kurt stops working and steps back.}
<C>__{kurt }
<D>__{your kid was down around diver's cover again, smoking pot. i didn't write him up...told him i wouldn't tell you...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thanks for telling me.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{at least your father tried, george.}
<A>__{kurt walks to his car and drives off. there's a moment of awkwardness with alyssa. george walks into his house leaving alyssa with guster.}
