<A>__{pete drives through the night up ventura boulevard with the "cruisers". he looks in the other cars and looks at the girls on the street. he drives past "tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows. he turns off the boulevard and drives through san fernando valley neighborhood streets. he pulls up in front of sheila's house and honks his horn. he lights a cigarette while he waits. in a few minutes sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window.}
