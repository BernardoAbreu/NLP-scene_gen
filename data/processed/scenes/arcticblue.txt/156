<A>__{eric and corbett wearily trudge through the woods. corbett has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth. as he walks, he sniffs at one of eric's eskimo potato roots and takes a tentative nibble.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{nome? i figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{told that's what our old man was. planned on going to sea, me and bob, 'til i read jack london. started trapping when i was ten. mailed the furs to sears. eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.}
<P>__{(off eric's look)}
<D>__{that was fine money.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.}
<A>__{they walk in silence. corbett tightens the tarp against the cold air and looks at eric.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't judge me. you're a joke, coming here from a fucked up culture, telling us what to do!}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yeah, it is fucked up but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(temper flaring)}
<D>__{all you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to. you don't understand shit! trappers, hunters we're part of the environment. who's protecting us?}
<P>__{(sourly)}
<D>__{i've seen plenty like you. so more }
<C>__{corbett }
<D>__{full of yourselves there's no room for other people's way of life.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what do you know about people? you live like an animal! a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{i'm real sad you don't approve of me.}
<A>__{he shoves eric with his handcuffed hands.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tell me what i should do, professor. you got all the answers. i shouldn't hunt? fine, i will just phone up and have a salad delivered.}
<A>__{livid, eric backs away and knocks corbett's hands away from him.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{don't push me..!}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{cowardly bastard. i'm in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you.}
<A>__{eric smashes his fist into corbett's face. corbett reels back, more surprised than hurt. eric moves in, furiously throwing punches. corbett plows his clenched fists into eric's midsection, doubling him over. gasping, eric rams his head into corbett and they fall into the snow. despite the handcuffs, corbett gets a few blows in. they wrestle fiercely, and eric ends up on top of corbett. he's about to throw another punch when corbett looks up at him.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{first you save my ass, now you want to kill me. make up your goddamn mind.}
<A>__{eric lowers his fist and climbs off of corbett. corbett gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence.}
