<A>__{rebecca opens the front door and dulaney barges into the room.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you lied to me!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i just left joanne braslow. she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marsh's house!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{she's mistaken.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{that's not good enough, goddamit!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it isn't true. you have to believe me.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no, i don't have to believe you. the jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't use cocaine anymore. if she says she saw me doing it she's lying.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why would she lie?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know, frank but don't you think that's something we should find out?}
<A>__{dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.}
