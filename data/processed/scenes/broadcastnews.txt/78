<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{...once again: the libyan government has disavowed any prior knowledge of the flight. this has been tom grunick reporting from washington.}
<A>__{the special report ended, jane breathes a breath she and blair momentarily grasp hands. the first talk concerns tom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he was brilliant. i've never been as proud of one of my decisions.}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(calls back to jane)}

<A>__{she nods... totally depleted.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, there were no major gaffs anyway.}
<A>__{ernie scoffs in her direction.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{thanks, everybody.}
<A>__{she exits the scene.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to the usher brothers)}
<D>__{this was important for tom there's that bonding thing that happens with the public and an anchorman during a crisis. it's not the conventions anymore; it's this kind of moment.}
<A>__{tom enters. he is exuberant.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{what a baptismal. congratulations.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thanks. with all the help you get, it's sure easier than local.}
<A>__{paul and ernie exchange a glance.}
<C>__{tom }
<D>__{where's jane? i'm still juiced.}
<A>__{ernie points off... as tom exits. the usher brothers hover.}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(to the usher brothers)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{we're here to play the new news theme.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{new theme? you don't need me for this.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{stay. why should i be the only one to feel silly?}
<C>__{man one}
<D>__{we need a synthesizer but this will give you an idea.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{wasn't he great?}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{it worked.}
<A>__{man two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective news theme: a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering composition the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact that the two men vocalize other instruments over the keyboard.}
