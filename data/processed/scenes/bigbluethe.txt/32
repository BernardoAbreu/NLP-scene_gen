<A>__{johana emerges from a down sleeping bag. she's wearing a big sweater and a wool hat. she is not sleeping. intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and walks over to the frozen window. jacques and frank are loading their luggage onto the snowmobile. outside, lawrence is saying "goodbye" to jacques. unseen, johana also waves from behind her curtain. jacques senses something: he turns around toward the cabin and smiles, waving his hand at johana. she hides behind the curtain and shyly waves back. jacques gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the frame. we are left with an endless array of snow caped mountains.}
