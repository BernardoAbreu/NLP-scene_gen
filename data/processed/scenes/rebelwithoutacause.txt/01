<A>__{a deep night sky. matte shot. camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight. on the final note of the bell, camera is full on the milky way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of easter singing to arise. the hymn is sung by the crude, unmatched voices of children. camera pans down to include: spire of a church. camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing. camera pans off window to show long shot. city. night. suddenly revealed crisp and sparkling with lights. camera pans down and over: a lonely street full of parked cars. the singing diminishes but a thread of it remains. a car has just parked. the headlights snap off. a man emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat. he slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows. he must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights. as the man walks by the lot, still whistling, a group of figures rises silently from the grass, figures who have been lying in concealment until now. they step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the man. at the sound of their boots the whistling stops. the man glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him, filling the pavement. a street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young. the man moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases. he begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too. suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures. they are upon him and around him quickly. nobody speaks for a moment, then one of the boys grins. his name is buzz. he is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity.}
