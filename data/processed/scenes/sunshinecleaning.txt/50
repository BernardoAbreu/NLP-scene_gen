<A>__{rose turns into the trailer park, heads past a row of trailers, and parks. rose and norah get out of the car and approach a particularly run down trailer.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{how long is this gonna take?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{all we have to do is go in and throw everything away. cake.}
<L>__{interior trailer home day}
<A>__{rose and norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of decayed flesh splashes them in the face. they lift their t shirts up over their noses and walk inside. old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. piles of trash lean like snowdrifts against the wall. cat food encrusted plates. norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. flies buzz. she darts to another room and retches.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{great, now we're gonna have to clean that up too.}
<A>__{rose walks into the bedroom, blanches and stifles a gag reflex. norah storms past rose and out the door.}
