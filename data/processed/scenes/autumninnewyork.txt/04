<L>__{exterior another central park walkway later}
<A>__{still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no, i see how you could feel this way. of course i do. it's human. but what i don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. i mean, we just met. feelings change. you don't even know me.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<A>__{she is amused by his confidence }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the minute i laid eyes on you. it's the saddest thing about getting older. you know people so quickly. i even knew you'd end up hating me.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, you're wrong. i don't.}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(with a weary smile)}
<D>__{give it time.}
<A>__{she laughs. then he stops. he hears something. she stops. she hears it, too. it's a girl's voice. he casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. he takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees two dozen people sitting on the grass and on folding chairs most are middle aged or older with a distinctly intellectual bohemian look to them. standing and addressing them is charlotte fielding, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. she wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ and for weeks i sat by her bed and cried. i told her i loved her and i begged her not to leave me. all i could think about was what i'd lose if she died. and then one night... she was in really bad pain... i stopped thinking about myself for a second and i thought about her.}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{i stopped crying. i said goodbye. and in less than an hour ella was gone.}
<A>__{the woman whispers in wills' ear }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it's so sad.}
<A>__{but wills ignores her. he watches charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. that's what i did to ella and i will never do it to anyone else again.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i hope no one ever does it to me.}
<A>__{she looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. a tear runs down her cheek. she smiles and wipes it away. the woman, seeing wills' interest in the girl, whispers }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{so what do you know about her?}
<A>__{he knows a great deal. or at least he thinks he does. but his answer is nonchalant }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that she's just a kid.}
<A>__{he takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. he steals one last look back. charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices wills. their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. meanwhile an old man has risen from his chair }
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i met ella at city college in 1938...}
<A>__{wills slowly turns and walks away.}
