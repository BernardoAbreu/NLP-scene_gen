<L>__{interior large ward day}
<A>__{kirsty and tiffany enter the ward at a run and then slow down to a confused and horrified walk. every bed in the ward is occupied, some by men, some by women, and every patient has in their hands, and is busily working on, a}
<B>__{lament configuration.}
<A>__{despite this collective work in, the boxes obviously still have the vicious characteristics they have previously demonstrated when used individually as is witnessed by the ten or so patients who are struggling on with their work despite having one or two hooks and chains connecting their flesh to their box. kirsty and tiffany move slowly down the room, a look of incredulity on both their faces.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh, christ. this isn't just personal anymore.}
<A>__{tiffany nods slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth across the ward. suddenly, the wheelchair patient from the earlier scene in this ward, who has been between two of the beds on one side of the ward, cuts across the girls' path. he too has a box on his lap. as he passes in front of them, he looks at them, giggles in an unmistakably insane fashion, and gives them a conspiratorial wink. then he simply proceeds to the other side of the ward. a second or so after this, as the girls edge down the middle of the room, they hear a rushing sound behind the double doors they are heading towards. suddenly, the doors slam open and revealed in the doorway is}
<B>__{malahide.}
<A>__{but he is not standing there. he is hovering about two feet off the floor. the umbilical limb that connects him to leviathan is still at the back of his skull. his face is contorted in a grin of manic glee as he floats three or four feet into the ward.}

<D>__{the doctor is in!}
<A>__{he laughs, and the sound is far from human. kirsty and tiffany stare at him.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{kirsty looks sharply at tiffany for a second, as if she is about to comment on her re found voice, but instead simply nods. she takes her friend's hand and the girls begin to walk very slowly backwards to the far end of the ward. malahide is too enraptured of his new power to pay attention to specific victims and so makes no move to stop the girls' slow retreat. suddenly his palms erupt into a writhing mass of tentacle like limbs as his head tips back to emit a wide band of leviathan's black light at the ceiling, accompanied by, renewed inhuman laughter. taking this as their cue, the girls turn and bolt for the doors at the far and of the ward and exit through them. the limbs extrude from malahide's palms only twelve inches or so and are all quite thin, but they all have independent movement and they all have various surgical like, gleaming tips. malahide floats over to the nearest bed. he looks at the patient and then looks at the bladed tips of his new limbs and, as if addressing them, speaks.}

<D>__{i recommend amputation.}
<A>__{there is another burst of laughter as the limbs fly at the patient, writhing, twitching, slashing, and slicing.}
