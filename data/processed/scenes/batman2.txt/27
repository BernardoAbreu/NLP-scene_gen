<L>__{interior warden's office day}
<A>__{mr. boniface and his attorney sit at a long table across from the warden and the members of the parole board.}
<C>__{parole officer}
<D>__{you want to return the money you stole.}
<C>__{boniface}
<D>__{intact. the map will show you where it's buried.}
<A>__{the parole officer stares skeptically at a hand scrawled map.}
<C>__{parole officer}
<D>__{all of it. forty two million dollars.}
<A>__{mr. boniface stares down humbly at the table as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear.}
<C>__{parole officer ii}
<D>__{why this sudden change of heart?}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{gentlemen, i want my debt to be repaid in full. i want to be a part of civilized society!}
<P>__{(oozing sincerity)}
<D>__{prison life is not for me. the guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people.}
<C>__{parole officer ii}
<D>__{sure, but forty two million dollars??}
<A>__{mr. boniface nods plaintively. it's quite a perfomlance. he dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type...}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{his record's clean. thirteen years without an incident.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{i'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. a student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals...}
<A>__{the parole officer thumbs through a stack of magazines: bird world, ornithological review, beaks and feathers, nest egg.}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{birds, yes. my only source of solace.}
<C>__{parole officer}
<D>__{in light of this rather extraordinary gesture, i see no reason not to endorse your application for parole.}
<C>__{boniface}
<D>__{thank you, sir. you won't regret it.}
<A>__{mr. boniface shakes hands with the members of the parole board. as the guards escort him out, a black mynah bird squawks loudly from its cage in the corner of the office:}
<C>__{mynah}
<D>__{crime does not pay. aawwk!! crime does not pay.}
<A>__{chuckles all around. on his way out the attorney gestures toward the mynah and beams at the parole board:}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{personally trained by my client.}
