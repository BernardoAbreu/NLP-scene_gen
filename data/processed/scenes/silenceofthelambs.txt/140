<B>__{night}
<A>__{close on a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried by pembry, as he approaches dr. lecter's cell.}
<C>__{pembry}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{ready when you are, doc!}
<B>__{in the cell}
<A>__{the bach is issuing from the cassette player. beside it, on the table, the pile of dr. lecter's drawings. the top one is an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of clarice. beyond the table, we see lecter's shadowy form, seated behind the paper screen. he calls out from there.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{just another minute, please!}
<A>__{pembry grunts, sets the tray down. boyle joins him, handing him a riot baton and a mace cannister, which pembry fastens to belt clips. boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring of keys.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{sumbitch demanded lamb chops for dinner, extra rare.}
<C>__{boyle}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what you reckon he'll want for breakfast some fuckin' thing from the zoo?}
<B>__{inside the screen}
<A>__{dr. lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet swaying slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in his cheek. suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of metal protrudes from his lips. he plucks it out, opens his eyes.}
<B>__{in extreme closeup}
<A>__{he is holding the pocket clip from prentice's disassembled pen a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar at one end, a square edge at the other.}
<B>__{dr. lecter}
<A>__{lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. he pushes down, hard, using both hands for leverage. after a moment he smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his eyes.}
<B>__{in extreme closeup}
<A>__{the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.}
<B>__{outside the cell}
<A>__{pembry and boyle turn as the toilet flushes, and dr. lecter reappears, looking jaunty.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{okay, doc, grab some floor. same drill as lunchtime.}
<A>__{dr. lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles backwards. he stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his hands.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i'm ready when you are, officer pembry.}
<A>__{pembry comes around the cell to squat behind dr. lecter. he tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his wrists. he shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods to boyle. new angle at cell door as boyle picks up the dinner tray, and pembry crosses around. pembry takes the keys from boyle, unlocks the cell door, and pushes it inward. boyle goes inside with the tray.}
<B>__{dr. lecter}
<A>__{watches as boyle approaches the table, above five feet from him. boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear off some of the mess of drawings. the music plays on.}
<B>__{very close on}
<A>__{...dr. lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift key, held between the tips of his right index and middle fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. and finds it. new angle favoring boyle as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards dr. lecter, stooping to pick up the tray. boyle's right hand is just inches from the tray when dr. lecter's hand darts}
