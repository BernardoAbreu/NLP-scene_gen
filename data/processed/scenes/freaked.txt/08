<A>__{thud! stuey misses the haystack by a few feet. he hops to his feet and dusts himself off.}

<L>__{exterior santa flan airport day}
<A>__{we see the airliner lowering its landing gear as it makes its final approach to the runway.}
<C>__{rick }
<D>__{here we are ernie, santa spam. world famous for loud music and hot sex!}
<C>__{ernie }
<D>__{it is?}
<C>__{rick }
<D>__{give me a few hours.}
<A>__{ka blooey! the plane explodes in a fireball. swish pan to reveal...}
<B>__{rick and ernie}
<A>__{standing just outside the airport. a porter follows with their bags.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{sure glad that wasn't our plane.}
<A>__{ernie nods. they're distracted by the sound of chanting. they squint into the distance, where they see a group of chanting protesters young "save the earth" types, latter day hippies, kids, seniors, etc.}
<C>__{protesters}
<D>__{ees mustn't stay! take your toxic crap away! ees mustn't stay!}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<A>__{some of their signs read "say no to noxon!", "coogan go home", "ees is killing our earth!", "ricky coogan sucks shit" (this one held by a nice little girl), "i like ike" (held by a confused old man, shuffling around aimlessly), "drink pepsi" and finally... "free nelson mandela" we widen to reveal the subheading: "inside specially marked boxes." we keep widening to reveal that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal some guy is eating as he watches the protest.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{jesus! we better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts.}
<P>__{(he spots the limo)}
<D>__{there it is.}
<A>__{off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo with tinted windows (and plates that say not ees) awaits. kevin, an ees exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly at ricky. the stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras out the back window invitingly. ernie tries to grab ricky by the arm, but he resists. he's looking at the protesters.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{wait a second...}
<A>__{his pov...}
<B>__{a beautiful young woman}
<A>__{standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a megaphone to her mouth and chanting. she puts down the megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully beautiful, in a no nonsense feminist kind of way. this is julie. rick is smitten.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{let's go, rick. they're waitin'.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{forget them. i got a better idea. if i can just find the right disguise...}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{coog, those hippies'll tear us apart.}
<A>__{rick spots a heavily bandaged man limping out of the airport on crutches. rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hey, how'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks?}
<A>__{the man mutters something weakly. ernie puts his ear up close to hear him better.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{he says the pants don't usually come off for less than two fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception.}
