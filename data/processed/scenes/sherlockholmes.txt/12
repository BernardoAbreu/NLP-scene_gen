<L>__{9a interior cathedral crypts}
<A>__{the second hooded figure moves back and melts into the shadows. still kneeling, still hooded, blackwood chants softly, latin incantation repeating and repeating. on the woman as her lips start to move in time with the incantation. this is spooky, real, powerful stuff. holmes and watson leap from the stairs to blackwood's level. blackwood simply ignores them. the latin incantation never stops. holmes is closer to the girl, watson closer to blackwood.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the girl.}
<A>__{the girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to plunge the point into her heart. holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and pulls her out of the pentacle. she collapses. simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a rush of air departs the tunnel. blackwood throws back his hood. we finally see his face. his eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark and cruel. holmes and watson are shocked at his identity.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{lord blackwood?!}
<A>__{blackwood applauds softly, strangely.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{well done, holmes. and watson as well.}
<A>__{watson raises his gun, trains it on blackwood.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{stay right there.}
<A>__{blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before i'd finished the first incision.}
<A>__{that's more than watson can take. he moves in to pistol whip blackwood is stopped suddenly by holmes' hand grabbing his collar.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{watson struggles forward against holmes' grip.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{holmes seems to be pointing at blackwood. watson looks, sees nothing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide. inches from watson's right eye is the needle pointed end of a quivering piece of high tensile wire, almost invisible the other end held between blackwood's hands. a really nasty concealed weapon. one more step and watson gets impaled in the eye.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{what a shame. that would've been fun.}
<A>__{we hear heavy boots on the balcony, as lestrade and his men finally appear. policemen flood the area.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{impeccable timing, lestrade.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<P>__{(vis blackwood)}
<D>__{is that ?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(re: girl)}
<D>__{we've gone for the doctor...}
<P>__{(re: blackwood)}
<D>__{and one for the rope.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{you should've waited for my help.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if i had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the yard.}
<P>__{(a wry smile)}
<D>__{i can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance.}
<A>__{lestrade turns, frustrated. he watches his men yank blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. she's still mouthing the incantation. lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them. grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to holmes.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{what do you make of that?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{some kind of ceremony. five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon.}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{the double circle's for his own protection.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{london will breathe a sigh of relief }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{ at the excellent work of scotland yard. as usual.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{bravo, lestrade. have a cigar.}
<A>__{holmes sticks the villain's cigar in lestrade's pocket and a police photographer lifts his massive camera. flash! an explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops. the scene is frozen bright for a split second and then it fades. credit sequence begins, music and titles over }
