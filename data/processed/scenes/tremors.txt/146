<L>__{exterior nancy's house day}
<A>__{nancy and mindy huddle together on their roof. the upraised scoop blade of the bulldozer comes into shot with val riding it. he helps them step across into it.}
<L>__{exterior burt & heather's house roof day}
<A>__{burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical pipe to which his tv antenna was anchored. heather works with the sections burt has already cut off. she is filling them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering the ends shut they're making bombs. then they hear rumbling. what is it, more creatures? they're surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption approaching.}
<C>__{burt}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{god damn! armored transport!}
<A>__{val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even with heather and burt. a creature occasionally slams into the underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{let's go you two. we're headed for the mountains.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{in a minute.}
<A>__{he grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse. he cuts off a length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs during:}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{come on, burt, we can't hold still long. they're damn smart and getting smarter by the minute.}
<A>__{burt hefts the finished bomb.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{that's fine. we've got some new things to teach them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{damn it! they'll sink this rig just like a boat!}
<A>__{just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures digging dirt away beneath it. earl guns it forward out of the depression they're making.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{see that? they're doing it now! they try it every time we hold still.}
<A>__{burt and heather are impressed. they rush around the rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs, handing them to impatient val who hands them down to people in the semi trailer during:}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{jesus christ, we're only going nine miles. be there in two hours, tops!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?}
<A>__{he holds up to rifles to heather, the hk91 assault rifle and another elephant gun.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{what do you think? max firepower or...?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'd go for penetration. the 458 shooting solids less ammo to carry anyway.}
<A>__{burt nods. everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:}
<C>__{townsfolk}
<P>__{(adlib)}
<D>__{come on! who cares! forget it! let's go!}
<A>__{dust flies up. the bulldozer tilts. earl guns it forward again. heather and burt grab a few more things and leap down into the semi trailer.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{give me a gun! i will take one!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{i wouldn't give you a gun if it was world war three.}
<A>__{earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the desert. burt and heather watch their fortress home recede.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{food for five years. a thousand gallons of gas. air filtration. water filtration. geiger counter. bomb shelter...}
<P>__{(looks heavenward)}
<D>__{...underground goddamn monsters?!}
<A>__{heather puts a consoling arm around him.}
