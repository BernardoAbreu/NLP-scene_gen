<L>__{interior kale's bedroom night moments later}
<A>__{kale quietly enters and shuts the door. he's hiding something behind his back as he sits on the bed next to a sleeping ashley. she stirs, opens her eyes, peers up at him, smiles.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{hey... where have you been?}
<A>__{kale holds up a folded piece of paper, hands it to ashley. she curiously eyes kale, then takes it, opens it to reveal a printed out picture of a long stem red rose. ashley smiles.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{if would have gone to the flower shop, but }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{ashley pulls kale in for a kiss. she pulls away, falls back to the bed. her eyes glance down at kale's ankle bracelet.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{so how much longer?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take.}
<A>__{a beat as the two peer into each other's eyes. then:}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{you know the other night... when you said you thought i'd be more messed up...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{...for a guy who killed his teacher.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i didn't kill my }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{shhh.}
<P>__{(kisses him again)}
<D>__{i know. i know.}
<A>__{we get the impression she knows a lot. kale leans in for another kiss. but this time, as they lock lips, ashley's eyes shoot open. her pov the first hints of daylight out the window.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{oh my god, what time is it?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{three thirty.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i've gotta go.}
<A>__{ashley scrambles out of bed for her clothes, getting dressed, searching for her shirt. kale spots it behind the bed. as he gets up to retrieve it, he hears a noise o.s. kale peers out the window his pov giles is dragging a heavy blue plastic bag down the stairs leading to the garage.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{you better see this.}
<A>__{ashley throws on her shoes, joins kale at the window. their pov giles pulls the bag into the garage next to what we presume is the mustang that's now been covered with a tarp. (note: the woman's car is still in the driveway.) kale grabs the binoculars. binocular pov we catch a glimpse of a few crimson red smears on the blue bag as giles heaves it behind the mustang.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{look, quick }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kale gives her the binoculars. ashley looks over.}
<C>__{ashley }
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{that's normal.}
<A>__{giles' garage door closes.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: woman's car)}
<D>__{her car... still hasn't moved...}
<A>__{ashley pauses, peers out the window again. she can't help but be a little concerned. then }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{so what do you wanna do?}
<A>__{off kale }
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(prelap)}
<D>__{you want me to do what?}
