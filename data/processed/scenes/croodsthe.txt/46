<C>__{guy}
<D>__{so the bear says, "your cave?" i've been dumping my bones here since last week.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{last week, haha. that's a funny story!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's not a story! it's a joke.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{what's a joke?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you know, just making something up... to make you laugh.}

<L>__{exterior tufa maze afternoon}
<A>__{the croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive}
<B>__{maze.}
<A>__{guy is handing out shells to the croods.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{here you go, one for you, and this ones for you.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{okay. okay. that's enough. i don't see why the kids need their own shells.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{so if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{wait you're saying we should split up?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we can try more paths at once. it's the fastest way through.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{croods stick together.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{your way isn't safe.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{they can handle it.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{we can do it, dad.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no no no no no. it's my job to keep you safe. i'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.}
<P>__{(seeing eep and guy together)}
<D>__{except for you two. and that's final.}
<A>__{grug sits down like a silverback gorilla. just then, a huge rumble. the earth starts to shake violently. the croods and guy are knocked down into the maze each `falling' into a separate entrance. they disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a drain. as grug and guy slide passed each other. frustrated grug, tries to punch guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{oh, hello.}
<B>__{inside the maze}
<A>__{the shaking comes to a stop. everyone (now separated) gathers themselves. on grug finding himself alone.}
<C>__{grug}
<P>__{(very frightened)}
<D>__{hello? is everyone alright?}
<C>__{ugga}
<P>__{(trying to calm him)}
<D>__{we're okay, grug.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{dad? i'm freaking out a little bit. just tell me what to do. just what do i do right now?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{stay where you are. i will find you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no. too slow. everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{grug}
<P>__{(almost hyperventilating)}
<D>__{yeah. okay.}
<B>__{on thunk}
<A>__{looking very frightened.}
<D>__{grug (o.s.) (cont'd) remember never not be afraid.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you can do this.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{it's gonna be okay. i'm gonna pass out.}
<A>__{thunk picks up his shell, and tentatively makes his way, alone, into his branch of the maze. on eep (or guy?) in another part of the maze. she puts her hand on the giant wall to her left. pull back and see that they are actually in parallel `channels' but with the huge wall between them. on gran and ugga encountering carnivorous flowers. on thunk encountering a croco pup. on eep finding a flower dropped on her path. on grug reaching a fork. ugga and gran don flowery camouflage. thunk throws his shell at the crocopup, misses. to his surprise the crocopup returns the shell. thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him the way through the maze. eep picks up the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds a more flowers dropped on her path. she playfully begins hunting for guy. guy and belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers in eep's path. grug pops out of a passageway he's back where he began. he chooses another tunnel. ugga and gran pass unharmed through the flower grove the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant. eep surprises guy and belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto eep's path.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{you dropped these.}
<A>__{guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. he smiles up at eep. they share a moment before eep shyly vanishes again. grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. he grumbles and enters a different tunnel. on the maze exit guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. guy is amazed that he and eep are both doing the same thing. he is smitten. guy goes over to eep. guy takes her hand.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{eep and guy turn to each other, just as thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the croco pup to fetch.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{here boy, catch!}
<A>__{a shell note signals ugga, gran and sandy's arrival. there is an obvious change in the ladies.}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{gran?}
<A>__{ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{belt}
<P>__{(approving)}
<D>__{raaah raaah.}
<A>__{a loud shell blast interrupts. it is followed by two others.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug?}
<A>__{grug lets out another blow on his horn.}
<C>__{ugga }
<D>__{i will go get him.}
<A>__{on grug still stuck in the maze. he holds his head in defeat, and tosses the shell down. truck in on grug.}
