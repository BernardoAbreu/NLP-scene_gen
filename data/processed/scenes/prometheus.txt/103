<L>__{interior magellan engineering deck bilge}
<A>__{the lowest deck, just above the gravity generators. condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water. card and vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready.}

<D>__{who would hang out here?}
<C>__{vigoda}
<D>__{the signs lead here.}
<A>__{a wet splatter behind them: they spin. but it's only a trickle of condensate from a drainpipe. they move on. behind them, from an eight inch diameter pipe, a white mass oozes, almost gelatinous. silently as a liquid it pours itself into the stagnant water and stands up. it is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. boneless and flexible and monstrously strong. a threshing eel's tail. its blunt head dolphin like and elongated. it opens its mouth. a pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly far, hungry and demonic. the alien strikes. card is gutted in an instant, torn up like a paper doll. he screams hideously and drops. the alien, whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness. stillwell and downs dash in with pistols and lights. vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. stillwell ducks. beside him, downs arches backward into the foul water. dead. for one moment downs's flashlight beam illuminates the alien. a nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. backlit, it shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull. a mockery of holloway. and then it's gone.}
<C>__{vickers's suite}
<A>__{vickers sits at her holography station. she's watching the video feed of stillwell's headset: horrific images of downs. radio chatter between stillwell and brick is faintly audible. vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. strides to her communications console.}

<D>__{david. david. answer me.}
<A>__{she gives up. pacing. hands shaking violently.}
