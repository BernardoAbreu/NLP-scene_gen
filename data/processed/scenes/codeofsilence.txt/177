<L>__{interior pool hall day}
<A>__{the place is busy. everybody in sight is either mean or ugly. eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him. the pool players not connected with this confrontation take one look at him, hang up their cues, and split. eddie heads for the back of the room. a pair of heavyweights fall in behind him. one of them grabs eddie.}
<C>__{heavy}
<D>__{hey, you ain't got no business back there.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i want your opinion i will beat it out of you.}
<A>__{eddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid step and they go down like gut shot rhinos. he heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path. he steps up to the door in back and kicks it in.}
