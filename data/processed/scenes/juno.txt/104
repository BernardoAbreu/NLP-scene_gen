<L>__{exterior dancing elk school track morning}
<A>__{juno waddles toward the field. the guys on the track team, ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. they stare at her quizzically. bleeker spots juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{did you put like a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah. that was me.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(blushes)}
<D>__{because they're your fave. and you can never have too much of your favorite one calorie breath minterior}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{well... thanks. i think i'm pretty much set until college on the tic tac front.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you know, i've been thinking. i'm really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you. you didn't deserve that. you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you know it's okay.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{also, i think i'm in love with you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{what, you mean as friends?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, for real. i think you are the coolest person i've ever met. and you don't even have to try.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i try really hard, actually...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, you're naturally smart. you always think of the funniest things to do. remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class, and it was addressed like, "junebug macguff, row 4, third seat from the blackboard"? and it said, "i'm having fun in barcelona wish you were here"? that was hilarious.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i was just bored. i only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. you actually look at my face. and every time i look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{it does?}
<A>__{juno presses bleeker's hand against her belly.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{wizard!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i think it's because my heart starts pounding when i see you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{mine too.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{basically, i'm completely smitten with you, and i don't care if i'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{well, yeah. you're the best friend i've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{that's all i need from you. that's more than i could ever ask for. you're just golden, dude.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{can we make out now?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{bleeker and juno kiss, oblivious to the gawking track team guys in the background. in the distance, near the school entrance, we see steve rendazo (the kid who always torments juno) regarding the makeout session with a sad, envious expression. leah passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the fence, rolling her eyes.}
<C>__{leah}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{you know, you can go into early labor sucking face like that!}
<A>__{juno gives her the finger, not breaking the clinch with bleeker.}
