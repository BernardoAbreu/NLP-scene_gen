<L>__{12 a series of shots a distant globe (miniature) 16}
<A>__{we see a strange and distant planet. at first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen; but with each new view it comes closer and looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent. the topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. much of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue. we can, however, make out a few narrow "green belts" and a patch of blue water. in the final shots of this sequence we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet. it appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. the water is blue black, the pinnacles vermillion. (this is the lake powell location, at lone rock.)}
