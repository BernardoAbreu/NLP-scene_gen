<A>__{we un freeze on lyn as he whirls and shrieks towards the insurgent. bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{of course, lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so i still think what he did was kinda...reckless.}
<A>__{the insurgent, understandably startled, flinches backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass. lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to pound the fallen man with it. the young iraqi moves to intervene but lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle. the blindfolded iraqi in the truck manages to open the door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand. the second insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victim's flight. when he turns back lyn has scooped up the insurgent's gun and is aiming it at him. beat. nobody moves.}
