<L>__{interior airport security checkpoint day}
<A>__{molly is coming through kirk's lane again. mr. fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through.}
<C>__{fuller}
<D>__{ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{she does. fuller is leering at her stellar body. she's about to go through when he stops her again.}
<C>__{fuller}
<D>__{why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it.}
<A>__{molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt. she starts to move through but again fuller stops her with a raised palm. he then motions to her breasts and crotch.}
<C>__{fuller }
<D>__{any piercings you'd like me to know about?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine.}
<A>__{molly steps through. the machine does not go off. she gathers her things and mouths a silent, "thank you" to kirk as she walks on. fuller glares at kirk but before he can say anything, randy, a young agent, calls out from the office.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{kirk buddy! phone call!}
<A>__{kirk walks over to take the call.}
<C>__{fuller}
<D>__{you best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister!}
<A>__{kirk takes the phone from randy.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{this is kirk kettner.}
<A>__{kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in.}
