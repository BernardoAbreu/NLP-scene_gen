<L>__{interior a hospital room, paris, france day, 1954}
<A>__{we see benjamin coming into the hospital room in france...daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital bed...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{and her leg was crushed...}
<A>__{she's still, her eyes closed. sensing him, she stirs. and then she sees him.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{hello, daisy...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{your friend wired me.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{that was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that i was alright.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{you would have done the same for me...}
<A>__{and her first reaction, to how young he is...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{my god, look at you. you're perfect....}
<A>__{which she isn't... she's quiet, and she suddenly says:}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i wish you hadn't. i wish you hadn't come here.}
<A>__{he's dead still.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i don't want you to see me like this...}
<A>__{she turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be there... before he can say anything... a nurse comes in saying something in french... she pulls the curtains around the bed... benjamin waits...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{her leg had been broken in five places.... and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk...}
<A>__{the nurse leaves... benjamin comes into the circle of curtains... it's reminiscent of when they sat under the table... the sheets over them... in their private world... but this time she lays in the hospital bed her back to him...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i will get a room... and once you can leave you'll come home with me to new orleans. where you can be with people who love you.}
<A>__{she suddenly turns...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{what home? who's we? i'm not going back to new orleans. new orleans is your home... i don't have a home... i haven't been home for five years... i'm not going anywhere with you...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{alright, i will stay here in paris... i will help you with anything you need...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{benjamin...! i know i'm feeling sorry for myself... but it wasn't supposed to be like this...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{do you understand, i don't want to be with you... i tried to tell you that in new york... you just don't listen...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{you'll change your mind.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{we're not little children playing under the table... remember, when you came to new york. you didn't belong there. i didn't want to be with you then, i don't want to be with you now! i want you to leave! i'm not going anywhere with you! i want you to stay out of my life!}
<A>__{and she turns away from him again...it's dead still... and we look at her staring at the curtains... and after some moments she turns back to look at benjamin... and there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze... benjamin is gone...}
