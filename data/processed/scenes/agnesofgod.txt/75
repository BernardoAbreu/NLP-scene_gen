<L>__{interior convent chapel day}
<D>__{father martineau is saying mass. all the sisters are there}
<A>__{singing together. father martineau places the host in the sconce, incences it and raises it}
<D>__{up. close on individual nuns at prayer including agnes.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior barn day}
<D>__{mother miriam is kneeling in the doorway of the barn, praying}
<A>__{when martha enters. mother miriam pauses.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her. mother miriam makes the sign of the cross and stands up.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{and my permission?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'd like yours too. mother miriam grabs a bucket and moves across the barn.}
<A>__{martha follows her.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{we'll see about that.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{don't deny it!}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i haven't decided yet.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{the woman's health is at stake.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{her spiritual health.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't give a damn about her spiritual health.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i know you don't. mother miriam starts shovelling grain into the bucket.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and i...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i am saying (distorted) a beautifully simple woman...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{an unhappy woman...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{she's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{then why did you call the police in the first place mother, huh?}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{because i am a moral person.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{bullshit yourself!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{catholic church doesn't have a corner on morality...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{who said anything about the catholic church...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{you just said...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{nothing...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{what have we done to hurt you? and don't deny it, i can smell an ex catholic a mile away. what did we do? burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? that was in the days when the church was a ruling body. we let governments do those things today. so what did we do to you eh? you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin? this time it is martha who walks away and mother miriam who}
<A>__{follows her.}
<C>__{mother miriam }
<D>__{so instead of questioning that one rule...}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(halting)}
<D>__{it wasn't sex. it was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said? she died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{stupid woman... and that's all?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{that's all? that's enough! she was a beautiful little girl.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{and what has that to do with it?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i wasn't. i wasn't. she was the pretty one. she died, why not me? i never said my morning prayers. and i was ugly, i was scrawny, i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, sister mary clitus, called me polkadot livingston.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{so you left the church because you had freckles?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{no, because i... yeah, yeah i left the church cause i had freckles. they both cannot help laughing at this absurdity.}
