<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{you'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...}

<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i wanted to come home, grandmama and i did. i came back to my home with you.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{you can't go back to find your home. your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.}
<C>__{anya}

<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{and we have found each other nothing will ever change that! i am your family, dear child, but i may not be your home.}

<A>__{anya looks up at the booming voice. anya's pov sees rasputin. back to anya: flashes, rapid images: rasputin from the last night at the palace young anastasia terrified orange flash of gunshots young dmitri leading them out the wall panel, then the face of the young dmitri superimposes over the zombie who is coming toward her.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{dmitri ... look at me! it's anya! it's anya!}
<A>__{dmitri stops. his eyes glazed and frightening.}

<C>__{anya}
<D>__{dmitri?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{anya... where are we?}
<A>__{we hear a howl from above and suddenly rasputin jumps down. the reliquary tied to his waist, he's more furious than we've ever seen him his face literally consumed with rage and hatred. anya is terrified but holds her ground as she did when she was a child.}

<D>__{i guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!}

<A>__{rasputin turns to anya climbing up a girder.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{that's only going to make you fall farther.}
<A>__{anya turns suddenly and kicks rasputin in the face, which has the same effect as kicking a brick wall. anya is thrown off balance and falls. rasputin pushes her with his foot and she slides across the floor to dmitri. anya and dmitri exchange a quick look as rasputin, chuckling, advances on them. anya reaches up and grabs rasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that dmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch. the blow does little but enrage rasputin. he reaches out and with one huge hand, picks anya like a rag doll and takes her to the ledge.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{anya!}
<A>__{dmitri throws himself against rasputin several times only to get batted away like a fly. realizing this is futile, dmitri slips through the floor girders and scurries towards the edge... below tem. dmitri pov: rasputin's large boots above him, heading for the edge.}

<A>__{rasputin reaches the edge, playful dangling the struggling anya over the side.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{my curse is now complete! good bye, babushka!}

<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{she manages to spin around, gripping his hand.}

<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{what a touching sentiment...}
<A>__{they look up to see his right above them. rasputin's boot smashes down on dmitri's hand, which grips the girder. dmitri screams out in, but doesn't let go. he looks down at anya and pulls her up while rasputin begins to pry off dmitri's fingers one at a time.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{this little piggy had a palace... this little piggy had a throne...}
<A>__{anya swings to another beam and now has firm footing as rasputin continues.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{this little piggy missed the firing squad..}
<A>__{dmitri is literally holding on with two fingers.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{and this little piggy wanted a home... and this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way... down!}
<A>__{as dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but his grasp on anya's hand is firm and she pulls him onto where she is standing. rasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet from anya.}

<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the reliquary is dangling. anya reaches up to grab on to it but her aim is off and she hits it. the reliquary flies and smashes against the side of the tower, shattering. rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away in terror.}

<A>__{of the eiffel tower as the evil spirits from the reliquary burst out. the spirits take on all the forms we've seen earlier: bears, minions, snakes, and combinations of all. they grow and swirl, with hideous moaning noises. anya and dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.}
<B>__{on rasputin}
<A>__{as the spirits begin to swarm around him, a tornado of horrid beings. re screams as they pull him off the ground.}
<B>__{on anya and dmitri}
<A>__{as the force of the tornado increases, they have to hold on to the girders and each other in order not to be sucked in. bartok is thrown against the side of the tower and slithers to the floor.}
<B>__{on rasputin}
<A>__{suspended over the eiffel tower in the maelstrom. he screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment him and explode pieces fly and disintegrate in mid air, in wild colors and smoke.}
<B>__{on dmitri and anya}

<B>__{on bartok}
<A>__{who rises, patting his chest he's about to let out a bartokism... but all the emerges are little bat squeaks. he's surprised as first, then thrilled. the spell is broken and he's just a bat again.}

<A>__{anya looks lovingly at dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i am home.}
<A>__{"hone is where you are" (the love duet for anya and dmitri). a simple emotional ballad for two people who realize at last that their hearts have led then to each other, to "home". this will work within the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but can also be re recorded as a pop single. the song continues over various scenes:}
<B>__{the empty stage}
<A>__{tatiana smiling, knowingly. sophie & vladimir sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party. xenia and estelle look at each other with their stone faces.. . and smile.}
<B>__{bartok}
