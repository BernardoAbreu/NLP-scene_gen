<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior a deck promenade aft sunset}
<A>__{painted with orange light, jack and rose lean on the a deck rail aft, shoulder to shoulder. the ship's lights come on. it is a magical moment... perfect.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{so then what, mr. wandering jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{well, then logging got to be too much like work, so i went down to los angelas to the pier in santa monica. that's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{a whole ten cents?!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<A>__{yeah; it was great money... i could make a dollar a day, sometimes. but only in summer. when it got cold, i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(looks at the dusk sky)}
<A>__{why can't i be like you jack? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it.}
<P>__{(turning to him)}
<A>__{say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{alright, we're going. we'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side saddle stuff.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{you mean one leg on each side? scandalous! can you show me?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{sure. if you like.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(smiling at him)}
<A>__{i think i would.}
<P>__{(she looks at the horizon)}
<A>__{and teach me to spit too. like a man. why should only men be able to spit. it's unfair.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{they didn't teach you that in finishing school? here, it's easy. watch closely. he spits. it arcs out over the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{your turn. rose screws up her mouth and spits. a pathetic little bit of foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{nope, that was pitiful. here, like this... you hawk it down... hhhnnnk!... then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and plooow!! you see the range on that thing? she goes through the steps. hawks it down, etc. he coaches her through it (ad lib) while doing the steps himself. she lets fly. so does he. two comets of gob fly out over the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{that was great! rose turns to him, her face alight. suddenly she blanches. he sees her expression and turns. ruth, the countess of rothes, and molly brown have been watching them hawking lugees. rose becomes instantly composed.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{mother, may i introduce jack dawson.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{charmed, i'm sure. jack has a little spit running down his chin. he doesn't know it. molly brown is grinning. as rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear...}
<C>__{old rose }
<A>__{the others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. but my mother looked at him like an insect. a dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{well, jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot they all jump as a bugler sounds the meal call right behind them.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{shall we go dress, mother?}
<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<A>__{see you at dinner, jack.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(as they walk away)}
<A>__{rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. honestly! the countess exits with ruth and rose, leaving jack and molly alone on deck.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{not really.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{well, you're about to go into the snakepit. i hope you're ready. what are you planning to wear? jack looks down at his clothes. back up at her. he hadn't thought about that.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{i figured.}
