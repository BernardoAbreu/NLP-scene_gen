<L>__{exterior basketball field day}
<A>__{a flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball courts faintly outlined across its surface. brendan stands crooked, watching the barren horizon. the wind blows bitterly, and the sky is dark. then, a speck. coming towards brendan, across the field. brendan slumps towards it. closer. still a dark dot. closer. brendan's face snaps into recognition.}
