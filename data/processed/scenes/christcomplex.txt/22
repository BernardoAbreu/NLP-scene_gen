<L>__{interior louis apartment continuous}
<A>__{louis' set up is more lavish than quinn's. it's obvious he indulges just a little too much. louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. he starts singing "motown" songs to himself. he walks back off screen to the bedroom. we still hear him singing, as we pan around the apartment. we swing back around to the entrance of louis' bedroom. he finally comes out fully dressed. he uses the towel he was wearing to finish drying his hair. he walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself. louis' pov he starts to run his hands through his hair. he tries to straighten up the mess on his head. he picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand. he runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.}
