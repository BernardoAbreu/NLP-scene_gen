<A>__{smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off from his swim, looking out over the water. a man's head appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. an old queen, his face almost purple with the cold. he clings to the edge of the platform for a moment.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{just in case it's of interest, dear. we are observed. old filth in the bushes. not very subtle but there you are...}
<A>__{he swims away. the wind lifts up a little, rustling the trees and bushes around the pond. we stay on smiley, watched and alone.}
