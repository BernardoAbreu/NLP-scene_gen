<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{the track goes silent. barry & claudette walk along a path. this is not an aimless walk, for barry knows exactly where he wants to go. he leaves the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing. claudette hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i care very much.}
<A>__{he puts an arm around her and draws her close. they kiss. they separate.}
<C>__{claudette}
<D>__{does chloe kiss as good as i do?}
<A>__{barry decides to be politic.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{claudette}
<D>__{oh, you...}
<A>__{she kisses him and they are locked. a bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above. the camera shifts to another angle: just beyond the thicket of lacy vines. it is a slow tracking shot which gives the impression that we are watching the action from the pov of another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen aged assistant counsellors making their first sexual encounters. this unseen observer will be called the prowler. barry reaches up outside claudette's t shirt to hold her breast. she reaches up to take his hand away.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{claudette...}
<C>__{claudette}
<D>__{somebody'll see.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{no, they won't...}
<A>__{he ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t shirt so that part of her bra is exposed. he seals her protesting lips by kissing her. from the prowler's pov, the camera moves to get a better angle. a hand moves into frame and pulls back some branches to clear the field of vision. a branch pops.}
<C>__{claudette}
<P>__{(in a thick whisper)}
<D>__{somebody's there, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{come on, claudette. a man's not made of stone.}
<C>__{claudette}
<D>__{let's go back, barry...}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i need you so much, claudette.}
<A>__{barry leans in and unhooks her bra. they kiss again, passionately. the prowler pauses, then moves, never seen except for a bit of foot or hand from the pov of the camera, closer and closer as the two teenagers become more and more oblivious. closer. the theme has snuck in. it becomes discordant. it swells. closer.}
