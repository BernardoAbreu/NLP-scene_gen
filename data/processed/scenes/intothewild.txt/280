<D>__{i wasn't much older than tracy when i got pregnant. and i thought my husband and i were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. but it didn't work out that way. he left. history. now ancient history. and that was the end of that. so, i raised reno by myself that's my son. then i met rainey. and that was really good for a while. but reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. and then, i don't know. he kinda followed in his father's footsteps out the door and gone. and i really don't know where he is. i haven't heard from him in two years.}
