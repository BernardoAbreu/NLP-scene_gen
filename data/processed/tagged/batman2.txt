<A>__{it's finally happened. hell's frozen over. christmas is two weeks off, arid snow is falling in gotham. beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks uncharacteristically serene almost inviting. peace has been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. salvation army santas ring their bells on streetcorners. and now, as night falls, an illuminated sign winks on above broad avenue: "joyeux noel gotham only 16 shopping days left till christmas." the streets are bustling with jolly shoppers. at a souvenir store, we find an exasperated mom squabbling with her seven year old. like many other storefronts in gotham, this one is overflowing with bootleg batman merchandise: t shirts, key chains, ceramic figurines. the kid is already wearing a batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously wants more. mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of scrap metal, with a sign reading "authentic fragments of the batwing $19.95 and up." a panhandler is perched at the entrance. beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow and black logo. in gotham this winter, batmania is everywhere...}

<A>__{a car full of trouble: selina, wearing a fur coat over her catwoman garb, at the wheel; the penguin riding shotgun; and frick in the back seat next to bruce, who's semi conscious and stone limp. the car idles outside the wrought iron gates of wayne manor.}

<D>__{what is it? what's going on??}
<A>__{vicki and alfred look into the back parlor. dick grayson has sneaked in behind the sofa and he's busy sawing away at bruce's bonds with a letter opener. both of them stiffen simultaneously if frick steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of dick and bruce.}

<D>__{you know, i've got a great recipe for sliced bitch }
<A>__{vicki lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing selina off balance into the center island. while they're tangled up, vicki grabs a meat cleaver and tries to bring it down on selina, but selina rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, swiping at vicki with her claws. vicki brings a calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: clang. vicki sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering selina with knives and appliances. it buys her enough time to make for the door but selina comes flying after her. another downswipe with the claws but vicki shoves a butcher's block into selina's path, and her talons wedge a half inch deep in the wood. vicki rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.}
