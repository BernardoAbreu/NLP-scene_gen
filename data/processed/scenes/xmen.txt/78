<A>__{they come into a room with a high sphered ceiling entirely black. in the center of the room is a huge for lack of a better term device. part computer, part super structure, it is the sort of precision tangle of metal and wire that would make da vinci weep. it has a space in the bottom that seems to fit xavier and his chair perfectly. suspended above its center a web of wires, tubes, and cables all connecting to the heart of the device a chrome skullcap. logan slowly circles the device. logan looks at xavier, perhaps even a little impressed.}

<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{we were friends once... but that was a long time ago.}
