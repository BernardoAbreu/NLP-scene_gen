<L>__{exterior san francisco streets (bottom of hill 33) day}
<A>__{the tumbling cable car hits the toyotals rear. the toyotals gas tank explodes, lifting the cable car. the ferrarils door flies open. goodspeed dives away as the cable car, aflame, cartwheels in mid air and lands with a whump on the ferrari, crushing it like a tin can. goodspeed, dazed, wheels away from the wreck, shielding his eyes from the smoke and fire. a young kid on a motorcycle rolls up. motorcycle kid you just fucked up your ferrari, man.}
