<L>__{exterior munson house night}
<A>__{the two women looking. the front door of the house opens. lump, the professor, and gawain emerge, escorting pancake. just before gawain finishes closing the door the cat slips out.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{pickles!}
<A>__{the door is yanked fully open and the general races out after the cat.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...you catch pickles now!}
<A>__{the cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, up his favorite tree. the general follows and, also without breaking stride, clambers up the tree after it. tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. we hear the hiss of the cat. the men are bundling pancake into the hearse. dorr calls to the women before climbing in:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for mr. pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt.}
<A>__{the cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{you let the cat out!}
<A>__{the general leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues the animal down the road. we hear the retreating padding footsteps of all six feet.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the general is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet. please go, go and enjoy your concert, and we shall see you later in the evening. au revoir, mes dames!}
