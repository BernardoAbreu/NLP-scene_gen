<L>__{interior screening room studio day}
<A>__{viktor sits with leading man hal, three executives and studio head elaine christian, watching a rough assembly of the film. it ends with a close up of nicola anders. the lights go up. the image of nicola fades off the screen.}
<C>__{executive 1}
<D>__{she's good. you can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{i've analyzed the footage. we've got almost everything we need in the can. if we rework the script, we can finish the film without her.}
<C>__{executive 2}
<P>__{(forceful shake of the head)}
<D>__{according to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today. they'll sue if the film is released with nicola in a single frame.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(more anxious)}
<D>__{so we'll re cast.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{it's a re make, hal. anders is not bigger than this picture.}
<A>__{elaine finally speaks up.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{of course she is. no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{we don't need a name. we'll cast an unknown.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i won't play opposite an unknown.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{we can't sell an unknown. nicola's soured on the project and we have to accept that. if we ever want to be in the nicola anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.}
<A>__{the executives, leading man and director nod sagely.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{no! you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(a wince, addressing everyone but viktor)}
<D>__{excuse us.}
<A>__{elaine ushers viktor out of the screening room.}
