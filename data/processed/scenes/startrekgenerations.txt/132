<A>__{picard has made his way back to the gnarled root. he stands a few feet away... a couple of pebbles in his hand. he glances at soran, who's absorbed with his work on the launcher. picard then surreptitiously tosses a pebble toward the root. it misses and bounces off the forcefield. soran looks over his shoulder at picard, who sits down on a rock. soran returns to his work. picard tosses a second pebble this one also hits the forcefield. soran turns with a vaguely irritated look.}

<A>__{picard doesn't respond. soran goes back to work. picard waits a moment, then takes aim and tosses another pebble toward the root. this time, the pebble bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau inside the forcefield. picard keeps his expression neutral, but he's found a way in.}
