<L>__{exterior morning}
<A>__{general smuts sitting erect and imposing on a beautiful chestnut horse rides down a tree lined street. he wears civilian clothes with riding boots and breeches. behind him, a junior british officer rides as escort. he turns into the entrance way of an imposing building. the hooves of smuts's horse clatter on the cobblestones as the general rides into the courtyard. two sentries come smartly to attention. a stable boy rushes to take the horse, and a tall civil servant approaches the general busily as he dismounts.}
<C>__{tall civil servant}
<D>__{the london papers have arrived from the cape, sir.}
<C>__{smuts}
<D>__{yes ?}
<A>__{the tall civil servant checks his notes.}
<C>__{tall civil servant}
<D>__{the worst was the daily mail, sir. they said, "the burning of passes by mr. gandhi was the most significant act in colonial affairs since the declaration of independence."}
<A>__{smuts has given the reins to the stable boy.}
<C>__{smuts}
<D>__{did they? well, they'll find we're a little better prepared this time. mr. gandhi will find he's on a long hiding to nothing.}
<A>__{and he strides into the building, past the smartly saluting sentries. gandhi's house johannesburg exterior morning gandhi comes from the house door. he carries a briefcase and is still dressed in european clothes, though far less elegant than we have seen him in before. his mien, the cut of his hair, all suggest a passage of time. as he turns, he stops because he is face to face with charlie andrews, a very tall, thin englishman, who wears a rumpled white suit and a clerical collar. he has descended from a horse drawn taxi that carries his luggage. he too has stopped. for a moment they both appraise each other, neither speaking. then}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you'd be gandhi }
<P>__{(gandhi nods.)}
<D>__{...i thought you'd be bigger.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i i mean it's all right. it doesn't matter.}
<P>__{(he suddenly steps}
<D>__{forward and thrusts}
<P>__{out his hand.)}
<D>__{i'm my name is andrews, charlie andrews. i've come from india i've read a great deal about you.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{some of it good, i hope.}
<A>__{he turns and waves to the parlor window. the three boys are there all bigger and ba holds a new addition; they all wave. and gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{would you care to walk?}
<A>__{he gestures charlie on and starts walking. charlie nods uncertainly. he looks back at the cab in confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with gandhi's brisk pace.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(noting charlie's collar)}
<D>__{you're a clergyman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes. i've i've met some very remarkable people in india... and and when i read what you've been doing here, i i wanted to help.}
<P>__{(he looks at gandhi, then smiles awkwardly.)}
<D>__{does that surprise you?}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<P>__{(and now he smiles.)}
<D>__{at first i was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up like you right out of the pavement. even when it is dangerous or }
<A>__{johannesburg suburb exterior morning they have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run down. ahead of them three youths (twenty, twenty one) in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path. they react to the sight of gandhi fun. then stride the pavement menacingly. one of them tosses aside his cigarette.}
<C>__{first youth}
<D>__{hey look what's comin'!}
<C>__{second youth}
<D>__{a white shepherd leading a brown sammy!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{perhaps i should }
<A>__{gandhi restrains him and shakes his head.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{doesn't the new testament say, "if your enemy strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left"?}
<A>__{he starts to move forward. charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for gandhi than himself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically... i don't think our lord meant }
<A>__{they are getting closer. the youths laughing, whispering.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i'm not so certain. i have thought about it a great deal. i suspect he meant you must show courage be willing to take a blow several blows to show you will not strike back nor will you be turned aside... and when }
<A>__{one youth has flicked his cigarette hard. it lands at gandhi's feet. he pauses, looking at the youth.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{...and when you do that it calls upon something in human nature something that makes his hate for you diminish and his respect increase. i think christ grasped that and i i have seen it work.}
<A>__{he starts forward again, he is almost on the youths clearly frightened, but...}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{first youth}
<D>__{get off the pavement, you bloody }
<A>__{and he reaches forth to haul gandhi from the pavement, but }
<C>__{a woman's voice}
<D>__{colin! colin! what are you doing?}
<A>__{a woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly. it is the first youth's mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably.}
<C>__{first youth}
<D>__{nuthing... nuthing. we were just cleaning up the neighborhood a little.}
<A>__{a snickering response from the other youths but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of colin's mother's attitude. there's no note of apology in her cold stare at gandhi, but she clearly believes her son should not be doing what he is doing.}
<C>__{colin's mother}
<D>__{you're already late for work. i thought you'd gone ten minutes ago.}
<A>__{the moment of crisis has passed. nothing will happen while she is there. gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{you'll find there's room for us both.}
<A>__{and he steps around him, charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly. as they stride on, charlie glancing back }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{that was lucky.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i thought you were a man of god.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(wittily, but making his point)}
<D>__{i am. but i'm not so egotistical as to think he plans his day around my dilemmas.}
<A>__{gandhi laughs as they turn the corner. busy street johannesburg exterior morning a busy street in the center of the town. gandhi and charlie come around the corner into it.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{...you could call it a "communal farm," i suppose. but we've all come to the same conclusion our gita, the muslim's koran or your bible it's always the simple things that catch your breath "love thy neighbor as thyself" }
<P>__{(he smiles, thinking back at the youths.)}
<D>__{not always practiced but it's something we hindus could learn a lot from.}
<A>__{he has paused before an office and a young girl (sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{well, we shall try.}
<A>__{and now he turns to sonja. behind her we see the small office "m.k. gandhi attorney." several clients waits, most of them conspicuously poor. sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding.}
<C>__{sonja}
<D>__{they're going to change the pass laws.}
<A>__{gandhi absorbs the news stiffly. smuts's office interior day a strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document.}
<D>__{smuts's voice over it's taken time, but it needed to be done fairly. we didn't want to create an injustice simply because mr. gandhi was abusing our existing legislation.}
<A>__{beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: jan christian smuts.}
<C>__{second voice}
<D>__{just one second, sir, please.}
<A>__{another angle. a cameraman records the moment with a flash photo. general smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document.}
<C>__{smuts}
<D>__{but on a short trip, i wouldn't spend too much time on the indian question, mr. walker. it's a tiny factor in south african life.}
<A>__{the reporter who stands opposite him is walker, much, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral.}
<C>__{walker}
<P>__{(a helpless shrug)}
<D>__{it's news at the moment. i will certainly report on your mines and the economy but i would like to meet this mr. gandhi.}
<A>__{smuts has risen. he knows how to concede with grace.}
<C>__{smuts}
<D>__{of course. we westerners have a weakness for these these spiritually inclined men of india. but as an old lawyer, let me warn you, mr. gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet, however "otherworldly" he may seem. but i'm sure you're enough of a reporter to see that.}
<A>__{the gaze is firm, strong, cynical... tent the farm exterior day the sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot. this is where the magazine indian opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around. a short westerner (albert west) is running the simple printing press which is powered by a crude generator. a small staff helping him. a sikh, a muslim, a couple of hindus, two young boys. gandhi and walker are approaching the tent from the river, gandhi discoursing earnestly.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{...so it's not "spiritualism" or "nationalism" we're not against anything but the idea that people can't live together.}
<A>__{they've reached the entrance to the tent, and he gestures in.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{you see hindus, muslims, sikhs, jews even christians.}
<A>__{this last remark has been directed toward charlie andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter. he waves, and gandhi shouts out to them all over the putt putt of the generator:}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{mr. walker! of the new york times!}
<A>__{they nod. one of the hindus bows with his hands clasped together. gandhi hands walker a copy of indian opinion and they start across the relatively barren field toward some other tents, walker glancing at the paper. gandhi watches him, grinning.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{without a paper a journal of some kind you cannot unite a community.}
<P>__{(a teasing smile.)}
<D>__{you belong to a very important profession.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{hm. and what should an "important professional" write about your response to general smuts's new legislation?}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i don't know... i'm still searching for a "response."}
<C>__{walker}
<P>__{(a leading question)}
<D>__{you will respect the law.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there are unjust laws as there are unjust men.}
<A>__{this carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest of the conversation has. walker measures gandhi with a little surprise.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{you're a very small minority to take on the government and the empire.}
<A>__{gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.}
<A>__{reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and walker senses it. but they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a european (kallenbach) is perched above a doorway on the half completed structure, getting a level. some indians are working below him. gandhi turns to him, light hearted again.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{this is mr. kallenbach. he is our chief carpenter and also our chief benefactor. he has made this experiment possible.}
<A>__{walker waves his notebook at him and kallenbach lifts his level in greeting. on his bronzed chest there is a star of david. walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head. we see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling children in the background.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" is that right?}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{that's right. the word only means "community." but it could stand for "village"... or the world.}
<A>__{walker looks at him appraisingly.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{you're an ambitious man.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(uncertainly)}
<D>__{i hope not.}
<A>__{a moment of embarrassed doubt, then he starts toward a half finished building wooden sides, door, but canvas still covering the roof. it has an awning spread before it. walker's carriage is tethered nearby, a black driver standing in the sun, waiting. in the background we see two women cleaning a latrine. walker glances at the latrine.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{they tell me you also take your turn at peeling potatoes and cleaning the "outhouse" is that part of the experiment?}
<A>__{as we have approached we see a table set for tea under the awning. there are two places. having set the places, ba is walking along the side of the building, away from them. she glances at gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or acknowledging him.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(a little surprised, a little annoyed)}
<D>__{ba we will need another place set for mr. walker's driver.}
<A>__{ba looks at him coldly.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{i will tell sora.}
<A>__{she turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance. gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude, but he tries to answer walker.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{it's one way to learn that each man's labor is as important as another's. in fact when you're doing it, "cleaning the outhouse" seems far more important than the law.}
<A>__{a grin but forced. when a girl (sora) comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting, gandhi calls to the driver.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{please come and join us you'll need something before your journey back.}
<P>__{(he nods to walker.)}
<D>__{excuse me a moment.}
<A>__{and he goes into the building, determined to find the source of ba's aloofness. gandhi's hut interior day ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to the building. she does not look up at gandhi, but she is aware of his presence. he crosses and stands in front of her with all the irritation of a husband. it is hushed, aware that walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed anger.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{now ba looks at him hostilely.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{sora was sent to tell me i i must rake and cover the latrine.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{everyone takes his turn.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{it is the work of untouchables.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{in this place there are no untouchables and no work is beneath any of us!}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(she looks up at him)}
<D>__{i am your wife.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{all the more reason.}
<A>__{he holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his.}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(finally, scornfully)}
<D>__{as you command.}
<A>__{as she starts to rise he grabs her arm, but she pulls free.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{the others may follow you but you forget, i knew you when you were a boy!}
<A>__{she says it derisively and it stings, but gandhi is aware of walker and he fights to hold his temper.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{it's not me. it's the principle. and you will do it with joy or not do it at all!}
<A>__{ba settles back defiantly.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{not at all then...}
<A>__{for a moment gandhi stares at her, and she back at him, resentfully. he suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, pulling her roughly to her feet.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{all right, go! you don't belong here! go! leave the ashram! get out altogether! we don't want you!}
<A>__{it is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against him.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{stop it! stop it! what are you doing!?}
<A>__{she lurches free of his grip, glaring at him angrily. for a moment they both stare at each other, shattered by their violence.}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{have you no shame? i'm your wife...}
<P>__{(like lead)}
<D>__{where do you expect me to go?}
<A>__{gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse. he sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding his head in his hands. ba studies him for a moment and she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. she moves and kneels before him.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{what is the matter with me...?}
<A>__{a moment, then she soothes the top of his head like the mother wife she is.}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you are human only human.}
<A>__{gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{and it is even harder for those of us who do not even want to be as good as you do.}
<A>__{and gandhi grins weakly. ba catches it and sends it back, warmer, less complicated by doubts. gandhi sighs, putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i apologize...}
<A>__{ba mutters "hm" and holds him a little firmer. a moment.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i must go back to that reporter.}
<A>__{ba nods.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{...and i must rake and cover the latrine.}
<A>__{gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her. she looks at him evenly no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes. imperial theater interior night the theater is packed. the front rows near the stage are held by rich muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with small traders, peddlers, artisans muslim, hindu, parsee, sikh. the gallery is bulging with indentured laborers largely hindu. the mood is restless, belligerent. on the stage. gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence. seated on the stage are khan, singh, three more leaders of the indian community. charlie andrews and herman kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs. gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes european policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row. a uniformed policeman stands near them.}

<P>__{(to the house)}
<D>__{i want to welcome you all!}
