<L>__{interior rabin's office}
<D>__{rabin + dave, please.}
<A>__{rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. the desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out. above his desk is a bulletin board. it is a breathtaking catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap sheets, memos and + post its. this is in the neighborhood of decades. rabin is a man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.}
<C>__{rabin }
<D>__{even if i was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. he's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{this won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.}
<C>__{rabin}
<P>__{(enunciating)}
<D>__{he won't go into the interrogation room.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{someplace else, then.}
<C>__{rabin}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{kujan looks around rabin's messy office.}
<C>__{rabin }
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{if it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?}
<C>__{rabin}
<D>__{and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{you know damn well what i think.}
<C>__{rabin}
<D>__{that's crazy, dave and it doesn't matter. he has total immunity and his story checks out. he doesn't know what you want to know.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{i don't think he does. not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. i want to know why twenty seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. above all, i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead.}
<C>__{rab zn}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{two hours. just until he makes bail.}
<C>__{rabin}
<D>__{they're all dead. no matter how tough you r. say this keaton was, no one on that boat could've made it out alive. 25 29.}
