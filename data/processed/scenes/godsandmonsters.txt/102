<L>__{interior whale's house kitchen night}
<A>__{clay sits at the kitchen table. whale opens the refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper, and a bottle of beer for clay. he pours himself a shot of scotch from a decanter and sits down.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{after dinner, if hanna isn't back? can we try a few more sketches?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i thought you'd given up on my picture.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'd like to try again. if you're game.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why not? give us something to do while we wait.}
<A>__{clay munches on his sandwich. whale pours himself another scotch, takes a sip.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{tell me something, clayton. do you believe in mercy killing?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{never gave it much thought.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{come now. i'm sure you came across such situations in korea. a wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? someone for whom death would be a blessing.}
<A>__{clay stops chewing. he stares down at his plate.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i never went.}
<A>__{he takes a deep breath, looks up at whale.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i never made it to korea.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but you said }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{ that i was a marine. which is true. you filled in the rest.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{clay downs his beer, refills the glass.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{my old man was a marine. he enlisted the day he turned seventeen.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the great war?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{by the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. he missed out.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{a very lucky thing indeed.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's not the way he saw it. to him, it was like his life never got started. nothing else really mattered. definitely not his family.}
<A>__{whale gazes sympathetically at clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the morning after pearl harbor, he drove down to st. louis to reenlist. he was so damn excited. world war ii was going to be his second chance.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{they told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{is that why you joined the marines? for your father's sake?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i figured he'd think, you know it was the next best thing. hey, i loved it too. a chance to be a part of something important. something bigger than yourself.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i didn't have the guts for it.}
<A>__{a look of surprise crosses whale's face.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i mean, literally. my body screwed me up. burst appendix. they gave me a medical discharge. all i thought about was, how am i going to tell the old man.}
<A>__{he breaks into a crooked smile.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you know what he did when i called him? he laughed. he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. said it was a good lesson for me. not to try to fill his shoes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm very sorry.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{them's the breaks, right? no war stories for this pup.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that's where you're wrong, clayton. you've just told one. a very good story indeed.}
<A>__{whale lifts his glass in a toast. clay empties his glass of beer. he motions toward the decanter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{he hands the decanter to clay.}
