<L>__{exterior amity main street day}
<A>__{in the busy center of a town preparing for the big fourth of july weekend, brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, purpose and haste in each stride. as he turns a corner a little man in a white smock emerges from the funeral parlor. this is carl santos, amity's part time coroner. santos looks both ways before crossing colonial drive. brody passes keisel's bicycle rental, navigating an awkward course through an odd assortment of schwinns that line the sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. keisel intercepts brody on the run.}
<C>__{keisel}
<P>__{(he stares at brody's face)}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<P>__{(stares some more)}
<D>__{glasses, right?}
<A>__{brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but keisel holds on to him.}
<C>__{keisel}
<D>__{look at those fences! little guys about eight to ten years old. and look at this!}
<A>__{he holds up bicycle. the bicycle's spokes are bent and broken from some sort of blows.}
<C>__{keisel}
<D>__{they did that with their bare hands.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{call me later in the day, okay, harry?}
<A>__{angle amity gazette newspaper office porch santos emerges with ben meadows, the stylish, late thirties editor of the amity gazette. together they cut a beeline for the other side of the street. angle amity street past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction and july fourth posters, brody enters hardware and sporting goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color from the display window to the sidewalk.}
