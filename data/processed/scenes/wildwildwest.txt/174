<L>__{interior loveless's lair amphitheater dusk}
<A>__{a candle powered spotlight swings across the stage and illuminates... a deep throated, bluesy black chanteuse who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "hangtown gals."}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'ohhh... hangtown gals are plump and rosy...'}
<A>__{loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and forgets gordon's execution instantly. and why not? she's young and beautiful in a rupaul sort of way. about six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number gordon had in his dressing room. accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa, silver buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those can can moves.}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'}
<A>__{she winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out her derriere to the crowd. they stare, mouths agape at this piece of ass worthy of othello. close loveless intrigued. well, maybe more than intrigued.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{a new girl! what a nice surprise!}
<A>__{he motions to hold up gordon's execution, rolls to her.}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<D>__{'painted cheeks and frilly corsets.'}
<P>__{(bends over showing her undergarment)}
<D>__{touch them...'}
<A>__{loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with his hand and whap! she slaps him right in the face.}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<D>__{'... and they'll sting like hornets!'}
<A>__{there's a hush in the crowd. loveless, a red handprint on his face, is a little nonplussed. amazonia moves in threateningly, but loveless stops her, starts to laugh.}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(making her name up on the spot)}
<D>__{ebonia! why are you so cruel to me?}
<A>__{ebonia has escaped a head cutting neck bracelet. but she probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost aches" in certain amputated places. angle gordon waiting to be executed. something's not quite kosher about her for gordon.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(musing to himself)}
<D>__{i have a dress like that.}
<A>__{angle chanteuse now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the stops. her gestures and dance moves become more exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'hangtown gals are lovely creatures think they'll marry mormon preachers.'}
<A>__{she sashays over to the french dignitary, pulls his monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it, steaming it up. as she pops it back on his face...}
<C>__{chanteuse}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'heads thrown back to show their features...'}
<A>__{now she puts her cheek next to rita as if matching their relative beauty while picking the pocket of lippenreider. rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before ebonia hands coleman the keys to the cuffs. coleman looks from the keys to ebonia. he just caught on.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{go, ebonia, go.}
<A>__{then ebonia prances on stage to gordon, cuddles up to him. gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with a mixture of amusement and relief. of course, it's his "i'd rather be dead" partner, jim west.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ha... ha... hangtown girls...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{not to sound ungrateful, but you're a little over the top.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{ha... ha... ha...}
<A>__{west ebonia wraps the feather boa around gordon's neck hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. gordon looks worried. what's he going to do with a gun? as he tucks it up his sleeve...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{let me warn you about that dress...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{gotta go. big finish...}
<P>__{(belts it out)}
<D>__{'ha, ha, ha! hangtown gals!!!'}
<A>__{an immediate standing ovation. the diversion allows coleman to unlock both grant's and rita's shackles. grant looks at the keys.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{where'd those come from...?}
<C>__{coleman}
<P>__{(nods to ebonia)}
<D>__{captain west.}
<A>__{their eyes practically pop out of their heads.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{she's... no...!}
<A>__{angle ebonia west one more time.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'ha, ha, ha... hang... town... girls!!!'}
<A>__{suddenly the tassels on his bosoms are spinning to the delight of the crowd.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(suddenly blinks)}
<D>__{wait a minute. what the hell is this?}
<A>__{he stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their own.}
