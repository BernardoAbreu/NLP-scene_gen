<L>__{exterior high up in the mountains night}
<A>__{well above the snow line, a small figure climbs the highest peak. it's elsa. finally, she stops, looks around. catches her breath and sings...}
<D>__{"let it go"}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{the snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. a kingdom of isolation and it looks like i'm the queen. the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. couldn't keep it in, heaven knows i tried. . . don't let them in, don't let them see, be the good girl you always have to be. conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. well, now they know.}
<A>__{elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{let it go. let it go. can't hold it back anymore.}
<A>__{elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with anna when they were children.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{let it go. let it go. turn away and slam the door. i don't care what they're going to say. let the storm rage on. the cold never bothered me anyway.}
<A>__{elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{it's funny how some distance makes everything seem small. and the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. it's time to see what i can do, to test the limits and break through. no right, no wrong, no rules for me...i'm free!}
<A>__{elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{let it go! let it go! i am one with the wind and sky. let it go! let it go! you'll never see me cry. here i stand and here i will stay.}
<A>__{elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{let the storm rage on....}
<A>__{in a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier, and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{my power flurries through the air into the ground. my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast }
<A>__{standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, elsa removes her crown and throws it.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{i'm never going back,}
<P>__{(back to resolve)}
<D>__{the past is in the past!}
<A>__{she takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{let it go! let it go! and i will rise like the break of dawn. let it go! let it go!}
<A>__{the sun rises. elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into the light. she's free.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{that perfect girl is gone. here i stand in the light of day. let the storm rage on!! the cold never bothered me anyway.}
<A>__{she turns and slams her ice palace door on us.}
