<L>__{interior hall of the heavens night}
<A>__{d'agosta throws open the doors and charges into the hall. jonathan lies on the ground, dazed. kawakita stands to one side, teeth chattering in shock. his hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the gun swings in his hand.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{where is it?!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i don't know! it hit me hard.}
<A>__{d'agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun. screams can be heard from the people crouched together at the edge of the room. hobbes is barking wildly, foaming at the mouth. it's too dark to see what's happening.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{somebody tell me! where is it now?}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{lieutenant. in the south corner.}
<A>__{d'agosta sweeps his light to the mayor who stands rigid in front of the others, points to his left. the light moves to the far end of the room where the dark shape of mbwun crouches over the body of a man. it's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions. the man is long past making a sound. from the monster comes a faint crunching and slobbering. jonathan rises, comes to d'agosta. so does frank. they stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns. d'agosta motions for kawakita.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{on three.}
<A>__{kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in. the barrel of his shot gun still swings wildly. he steadies it by taking it in both hands.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{one, two... three.}
<A>__{all three fire. there's a loud report. the kickback knocks kawakita backwards. screams erupt from the huddled group. hobbes abruptly shuts up. the men fire and fire until there's nothing left. d'agosta reaches for more shells, comes up empty.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{jonathan! get everyone behind me!}
<A>__{jonathan moves. d'agosta sweeps his light across the room but already the shape is gone. cuthbert hides behind the mayor, calls out in a terrified squeal.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{it went out the door to the rotunda!}
<A>__{d'agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors. there's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam both doors. he picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles. backs up. the doors shudder as something hits them hard.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{get everyone into the stairwell!}
<A>__{jonathan, the mayor, cuthbert and kawakita together herd everyone towards the stairwell. they move inside.}
