<L>__{interior tudor's apartment night}
<A>__{rollo enters and closes the door behind him, deliberately slamming it. he walks into the center of the living room and bellows.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{hello, good evening, is anybody here? dr. st. luc? it's dr. linsky here to see you for consultation.}
<A>__{still no answer. rollo is puzzled. he snoops around the apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half closed. he pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{it's dr. linsky. anybody home?}
<A>__{rollo can now see the figure of tudor lying in bed in the dim light of the bedroom. rollo enters the bedroom.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{is that mr. nicholas tudor? it's dr. linsky. i'm meeting dr. st. luc here. he must be a little bit late.}
<A>__{tudor does not answer, does not move. he lies stiffly on the bed on his back, mouth insanely agape, eyes shut, covers half on the floor.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{is anyone here? nicholas tudor? is that you? tudor? mind if i have a look at you?}
<A>__{he stands at the edge of the bed, peering at tudor, looking for signs of consciousness. after a pause, he kneels on the bed and slowly draws back the covers.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{just a peek, ok? a little peek won't hurt.}
<A>__{tudor's abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn back. crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged blood parasites, which sits poised for only a fraction of a second before it springs at rollo's face with great energy. as the thing hits rollo's face it locks on to his head by entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching its suckers to his cheeks and chin. rollo tries to stand, then staggers and falls. the thing tries to force its way into rollo's mouth, cutting his lips in the process. they bleed furiously. when rollo manages to pull a sucker away, a piece of his flesh comes with it. as he writhes on the carpeted floor, two more parasites appear crawling toward him from under the bed, covered with dust from the floor. they clamber on to him and fasten on to his face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. one of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. rollo screams in pain. he manages to roll to his feet. he staggers out of the darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still locked on to his face. they try to pull his lips apart, but he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing their way into the depths of his body. he takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. with a sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment on to the sink. his hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by tudor weeks ago. rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites from his face with their steel jaws. the parasites, swollen with tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them apart. in the bedroom, tudor's eyes snap open. his head rises from the pillow. he swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream. he begins to mumble.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{no, no, no, no. mustn't, mustn't. you mustn't kill them, no, no, no.}
<A>__{then, as though listening to himself and suddenly understanding what he is saying, he rises to his feet shakily and walks to the kitchen. he stops at the kitchen door. rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding away at them in the kitchen sink. the parasites wriggle and curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at them with the pliers. tudor staggers toward rollo.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{no, no. you mustn't kill them. that's my blood you're spilling! my blood! let them come home, let them come home, home, home inside me. don't kill them...!}
<A>__{he starts to paw rollo, feebly trying to prevent him from further mutilating the parasites. he reaches over st. luc's shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(whining pitifully)}
<D>__{at least save me one! for god's sake! at least save me one. one, one, one, one...}
<A>__{rollo turns as tudor begins to shove the piece of flesh back down his throat. as rollo turns we see that bits of tentacles and suckers are still attached to his cheeks, throat, forehead. his face is melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the corrosive fluid on one side. he stares in rage at tudor. with a scream, rollo strikes tudor with the pliers. tudor falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. rollo drops the pliers on the floor. he stares at tudor in shock. his face is reflected in a copper frying pan hanging over the stove. noticing the reflection, rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. he gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering and moaning. still shaking, he turns to leave. without warning, tudor leaps up at rollo with insane energy and bowls him over, pliers in hand. sitting on rollo's chest, tudor smashes away at rollo's face and head with the pliers, the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to rollo's face as he drools.}
