<A>__{barely ambulatory, hasari starts down the street, but has to stop, lean against a wall. through his woozy haze, he thinks he sees an apparition.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{there, in the entrance to a building, is gangooly. seeing a potential victim, he swoops in.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{not well, brother?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{still stealing from refugees?}
<A>__{gangooly looks at hasari, recognizes him, and gives him an amazing smile.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{well, yes, i remember you, of course hello! i am delighted to see you yes. and tell me immediately, please your little family, your beautiful children, everyone eats, yes. come, have a cup of tea or a little something stronger, we must celebrate.}
<A>__{gangooly starts to move, to position himself for a get away. hasari blocks his egress, unsmiling.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{ah, well, you're angry at me, yes, i wondered if that was still on your mind i am full of regret about that, yes, even a little tormented. what can i say? i have the spirit of an eagle trapped in the body of a crow.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i'm touched.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{my friend, i am lame and i am poor. does that mean that i shouldn't survive? huh? when a man is struggling in a rough sea, he clutches onto what he can or he drowns. you don't look so well.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i lost my rickshaw.}
<A>__{gangooly gives hasari an appraising look for a moment, then...}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{ach! i have an offer. no, listen! shiva be my witness, you must at least think about this. please, i can help... or my name is not mr. gangooly.}
