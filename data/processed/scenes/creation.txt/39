<L>__{exterior down house. the sand walk. the present. day.}
<A>__{the sand walk is a gravel walking path between the garden and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows.}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{we're reforming the linnean. the committee will comprise myself, lyell, huxley...yourself of course if you are willing.}
<A>__{darwin grunts noncommittally. the crunch crunch of their feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal shod walking stick.}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{we intend to reclaim science as a profession wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle collectors. your book will be our rallying pointerior}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{you know it is not yet any fit state to publish.}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{i have read your detailed abstract. the argument is complete and utterly compelling. all that is lacking is the detail and we know you have that in abundance. your barnacle work has established you as the pre eminent authority on marine life.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{on one small mollusc!}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{in which the whole story of creation can be read. do not pretend to me that was not your intention.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{honestly....}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{a "family tree" of barnacles stretching back 300 million years to the time it was a free swimming prawn!.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{there are many gaps.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{of course with gaps! but that is the very pointerior if we but had the complete fossil record we could trace all life back to one speck of protoplasm. the branching of forms in ever more complex succession...until.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{yes yes, but one cannot infer too much.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{mr darwin. either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand you own accomplishment. you have killed god.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{mr huxley}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{....and good riddance to the bearded malicious old bugger!}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{please i must beg of you....}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{no. i must beg of you sir. joseph hooker we know is too nice a chap to do it. you are a fine and brilliant man who hates to give offence an admirable quality wish i had it myself. but what do we believe? what do we know to be true. will you light the way or leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade.}
<A>__{he stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{a touch of indigestion. it will pass.}
<A>__{its clearly worse than that, but huxley, refusing to be distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him til the worst of it passes.}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{it is time to write your book mr darwin. write it brilliantly as we all know you can. strike hard and fast with a blow that is utterly conclusive.}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{sir, you are talking like a revolutionary and really...}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{it is a revolution. and not before time.}
<C>__{huxley }
<D>__{goodbye to the lot of em damned bishops and archbishops with their threats of eternal punishment.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{and you'd replace gods laws with what.}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{the laws of logic. the laws of nature.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{knowing, as we do, that most capital crimes are her everyday practises: theft, rape, murder, adultery, infanticide....}
<A>__{huxley waves it away}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{we live in a society bound together by the church. an improbable sort of barque i grant you but at least it floats. you suggest we change all that at a stroke. you wish me to rebuild, plank by plank, the very vessel we are sailing in.}
