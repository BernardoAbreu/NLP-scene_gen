<A>__{cyrus steps over maggie's body, heads to the door.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{the final configuration's starting... gather your things, let's go...}
<A>__{kalina picks up her knapsack. then abruptly, she hears a hiss, turns cyrus has stepped through an open doorway on the neighboring wall, and that door has just snapped shut.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{cyrus?}
<A>__{cyrus presses a stud. there's another hiss. kalina turns pale. the door separating her from the fallen maggie has just slid aside. she turns to cyrus }
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{cyrus! stop screwing around! let me outta here!}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{good bye, my dear... thanks for all your help. maybe we'll see each other again on the other side.}
<A>__{he smiles, hits another switch. the walls surrounding kalina begin closing in on her.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{motherfu }
<A>__{she kicks the glass! tries holding it back, no use. it keeps coming. panic starts to set in. the glass moves in closer. finally pinning her.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{oh, god... no... please...}
<A>__{her face is pressed up against the glass, her breasts flattened. her eyes go wide. she starts to scream and scream... we start to hear the snapping of ribs. her arms narrower than her body, claw uselessly at the glass.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{aaahh...}
<A>__{her head, now turned sideways, is being pressed flatter and flatter... abruptly there's a ghastly dull clunk as her skull splits and blood and brains splatter out. the walls continue to close, crushing her body, flattening, distending it, until there is nothing recognizable. and still the walls keep closing, until the entire inner surface, from wall to wall and floor to ceiling is filled with a microscopically thin red smear that was once kalina.}
