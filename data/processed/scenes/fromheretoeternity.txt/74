<C>__{prew}
<D>__{alma...}
<A>__{she smiles ruefully, realizes her real name has rubbed off some of the enchantment.}

<A>__{it's not the army that's doing it. it's man. i love the army.}
<C>__{alma}
<A>__{love it? well, it sure doesn't love you in return.}
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{when you love something it doesn't mean they got to love you in return.}
<C>__{alma}
<A>__{yes, but a person can stand just so much from something }
<C>__{prew}
<A>__{no! a man loves a thing, he's gotta be grateful.}

<A>__{alma takes the mouthpiece, looks it over, seems unimpressed.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(as if saying "i was elected president")}
<D>__{they picked me to play a taps at arlington cemetery.}

<C>__{prew}
<D>__{look. think. you ever think how strange a tree would look to one who had never lived upon the earth? well, somehow that's how i feel when i play a bugle...}

<D>__{hello, citizen! i told ya i'd meet ya, dint i?}
<A>__{they turn and angle widens to include maggio, who has just come up to the bar. he is in uniform. prew is pleased to see him but also alarmed; there is something near desperate under maggio's drunkenness.}
