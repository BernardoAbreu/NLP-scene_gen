<L>__{exterior space millennium falcon tie fighters}
<A>__{the millennium falcon races away from the colliding star destroyers, still followed by four tie fighters. laser bolts spark the pitch black skies.}
<L>__{interior millennium falcon cockpit}
<A>__{things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet. chewie barks at han. leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive. the ship is buffeted by laser blasts.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{prepare to make the jump to light speed.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{but, sir!}
<A>__{the buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{they're getting closer!}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(with a gleam in his eye)}
<D>__{oh yeah? watch this.}
<A>__{expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there. han and chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{watch what?}
<A>__{han tries again. still nothing.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i think we're in trouble.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{if i may say so, sir, i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. it's impossible to go to light speed!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{we're in trouble!}
<A>__{the explosions become heavier.}
