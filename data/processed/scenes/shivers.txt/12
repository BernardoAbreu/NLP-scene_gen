<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment afternoon}
<A>__{dr. roger st. luc, tall, thin, dark, not bad looking, stands over the table staring at the corpse of annabelle. as he watches, two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and begin to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor. the voice of the superintendent of the building drifts over to him from the other end of the apartment.}
<C>__{super }
<D>__{like i said to the police officer, he paid the rent, dr. hobbes did. and he came around and chatted a lot with everyone here, the staff, i mean. nice guy. not a high and mighty type. but it was her name on the residency list and the buzzer board: annabelle... what was it again?... annabelle horsefield. she never complained about anything, not to me, anyway.}
<A>__{the super, a small, unshaven, harassed little man with a lot of energy, is talking to a large beefy detective who writes everything down in a notebook.}
<C>__{detective}
<P>__{(pointing to}
<D>__{annabelle's corpse, which is just being}
<P>__{carried out the door)}
<D>__{and that was her. annabelle horse... field.}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{far as i know, yeah, that was her.}
<A>__{the detective now turns to st. luc, who is crouched on the floor examining the chalk outline around where hobbes's body had lain.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{is that the man who called you up here?}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{yeah, that's dr. st. luc. he's the head of our little medical clinic here.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{medical clinic?}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{well, let's go talk to your doctor.}
<A>__{the detective walks over to st. luc and the super follows. st. luc rises to meet him. he is wearing very informal summer clothes, a bit rumpled.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{dr. st. luc? detective sergeant heller. i'd like to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(obviously a bit dazed}
<D>__{by what he has been}
<P>__{seeing)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{you're the one who found the bodies?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{no, nothing.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{you knew these people?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{i knew the man, emil hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. i saw the girl around the building but i didn't know her. she never came to the clinic.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{oh, no. i haven't seen dr. hobbes since i was in medical school. he taught me... he was my prof in urology and... i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. that was it. i had no idea he'd ever set foot in starliner towers until today.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{i see. then what brought you up here?}
<A>__{st. luc begins to pace about as he talks.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{it was very strange. he called me at six this morning. hobbes called me. i thought i was dreaming. i haven't heard that voice for so long. he told me who it was, then he said something like, 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. i want you to go out for lunch with me. it's time you furthered your education.' then he laughed and hung up. i went back to sleep. he called me again at eight to remind me to come.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{how did he sound this time? was he nervous? depressed?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{he sounded fine.}
<A>__{the telephone rings. the super, who has been fiddling with a window with a cracked pane of glass, grabs the phone instinctively without looking at the detective, who probably would have answered it himself.}
<C>__{super}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who? no, that's not me. you got the wrong guy. just a sec.}
<P>__{(looks up at st. luc}
<D>__{and holds out the}
<P>__{phone to him)}
<D>__{it's for you. somebody wants to know how come you didn't show up for lunch.}
<A>__{the detective looks suspiciously at st. luc, who simply looks dazed.}
