<L>__{exterior big sur house. steps. night.}
<A>__{valentine hurries down the rickety steps. trying not to slip in the darkness, though there are tiny malibu lights illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.}
<L>__{exterior beach. night.}
<A>__{a rocky cove. valentine looks back up the way he came, hearing the footsteps coming down after him. backs away a few paces on the slippery rocks. falls. lands on the crumpled, dead body of larry, the bodyguard, who was thrown off the cliff. valentine recoils. when wilson appears, valentine fires at him. a wild shot that only makes wilson duck momentarily. valentine scrambles to his feet, runs on.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{jumps down from the steps. stops for a moment and leans his back against the railing. bends at the knees slightly.}
<B>__{the knife}
<A>__{the handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.}
<B>__{further down the beach}
<A>__{valentine runs. or tries to. it's dark and the ground is treacherous. the beach runs out pretty soon. now just rocks. maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the point at the other end. but he can't see very far ahead. and the tide is in, water making any escape extremely difficult. he tries to scramble over some rocks. they're wet, slippery. he falls, cries out as he literally breaks an ankle.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{a dark figure. coming into focus. walking inexorably this way.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{painfully rights himself. a small bone protrudes from his broken ankle. he fires at wilson, gun in one hand, other hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it. doing his best to aim. but the shots miss their mark.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{steadily coming.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{out of bullets now. gun clicking crazily on empty. he simply drops it.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{now stands before him.}
<B>__{the two of them}
<A>__{both breathing hard.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{this is not what valentine expected.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{tell you ...}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{about jenny.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{tell me about jenny.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{about the deal . whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.}
<A>__{wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling valentine.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me. tell me about it, you fucking bastard.}
<A>__{easing up just enough for valentine to sputter out a response.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she could've had the deal! i would've handed it to her if she wanted. i would have given her everything. wilson why then. why did you do it!}
<A>__{they're locked in a kind of embrace. sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks. sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it. to stop me. she said she'd turn me in .}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{shock of recognition on his face. at those words.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she said, "you go ahead with this, i will turn you in, terry."}
<A>__{wilson sits back. panting. totally spent. the two of them. both on the ground now. whatever energy they had left drained valentine from his confession, wilson from hearing it. valentine shaking, sobbing. still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she was serious. she would have done it. she had the phone in her hand. she was going to do it.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{knows that the girl he loved ... loved valentine, too. having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished. he gets up and walks away. leaving the quivering shell of valentine behind.}
