<L>__{interior wiltern theatre auditorium and stage night}
<A>__{the lights are dimming. harry glances across at dorothea, whose gaze is intent. the lights go out. the music swells, and the curtains fly apart. a spectacle worthy of seigfried and roy is about to blast our senses! magic for the 90's: a wild, erotic ride into mystery.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. you are standing on the threshold of a miracle...}
<A>__{a vortex of smoke and light swirls in the middle of the stage. the vortex blazes and suddenly swann sweeps down out of the flies, as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor toothed dragon emerges in a cloud of crimson smoke. swann raises his hands above his head and a spear miraculously appears in his grasp. he descends on the dragon. it's a classic image: st. michael smiting the devil. swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. the theatre shakes at its dying roars. then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed dancers, male and female. swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his panther appears. a roar of applause from the audience. swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends. by the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star shot tuxedo. the panther licks his hand in welcome. the music comes to a crescendo. the dancers freeze in their erotic dance. in the sudden hush, swann speaks in a whisper.}
