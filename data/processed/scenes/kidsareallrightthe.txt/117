<L>__{interior joni's dorm room bedroom later}
<A>__{joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. she goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. she starts making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. she stares out toward the hallway. finally she moves to the doorway and looks out. she realizes her family isn't there.}
<L>__{exterior dorm building day}
<A>__{joni exits, looking around to find her family. the station wagon is gone. she looks panicked. her pace quickens as she makes her way down a hill toward the road. finally joni sees the volvo heading towards her. the car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out. joni looks vulnerable. she tries to cover it.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{where'd you go?!}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{we had to move the car.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{i thought you left.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{give us some credit.}
<A>__{and suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. it's time to say goodbye. first laser comes up and hugs joni.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{it's gonna be weird not having you at home.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{sorry to leave you alone with them.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{it's okay. i can handle it.}
<A>__{laser backs up. then the moms both come up and hug joni, tears streaming down their faces.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{guys, come on...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, i will talk to you soon.}
<A>__{joni tries to detach from the hug. but her moms won't let go. they keep holding her and crying. slowly, their tears begin to break joni down. trapped in their loving embrace, joni's feelings rise up, unbidden, overpowering her. she starts crying. the moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder. soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure, resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her. nic and jules feel their daughter letting go. they hold her tight to comfort her. they keep holding her until a calm sets in. the hug breaks apart. nic pushes the hair from joni's face. joni gives her moms one last smile. laser, jules and nic get back in the car. joni stands watching as they drive off and her new life begins.}
