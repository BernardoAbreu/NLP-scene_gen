<A>__{we see a short montage of arthur, now sober, taking care of hobson with marty's help: reading to her...watching another bear documentary...arthur doing silly yoga for hobson...}
<L>__{interior arthur's apartment. hobson's room night}
<A>__{arthur is quietly cleaning hobson's room. he stumbles on a document. it reads: `the boy whose heart escaped' by n j snart. final manuscript.' he opens it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how did this get here?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you might have a brain tumour but you're not a complete veggie burger just yet. has naomi been here?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{she dropped by once or twice. frightful needy trollop.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i thought she gave up writing.}
<A>__{arthur's reading the manuscript, bearing hobson's notations: `shorten', `wonderful do not cut!', `beautiful. i cried'.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{just trying to spare her outright humiliation while i'm still here.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{don't wear yourself out. you're not going anywhere soon.}
<A>__{he taps the top of a state of the art heart monitor.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{world's most advanced heart rate monitor. the tiniest problem will alert your own private platoon of paramedics camped out downstairs...}
<A>__{hobson takes arthur's hand.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur. i've loved caring for you so much. but you'll never grow up with me around. so either i retire. or i die. option 1 involves too much paperwork and blather with having to find somewhere else to live. and no offence to you, dear boy...}
<A>__{she glances at a massive pile of bear documentary dvds beside the world's biggest teddy bear.}
<C>__{hobson }
<D>__{...but i think we've exhausted the bear based entertainment. which leaves option 2.}
<A>__{arthur can't fight the tears any more.}
<C>__{hobson }
<D>__{you're a good son, arthur. you can do anything with your life that you want. just like i did.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{exactly. sorry arthur. i'm past my use by date.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sorry, hobson, you don't win this one. i need you to care for me.}
<P>__{(holds up a pill)}
<D>__{now take your fish oil.}
