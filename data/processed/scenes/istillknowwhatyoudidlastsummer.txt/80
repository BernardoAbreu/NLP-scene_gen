<L>__{interior hotel julie's room night}
<A>__{the door creaks open once again to her room. and from a stranger's pov we slowly creep inside. a cloud of steam billows from the open bathroom. the sound of a shower is heard. we move toward it.}
<L>__{interior shower}
<A>__{eyes closed, julie stands with her face right under the showerhead, trying to relax. something softly goes thump. julie opens her eyes. turns off the shower. stands there, frozen, listening.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{will...?}
<A>__{no reply.}
<B>__{at the bathroom doorway}
<A>__{in a robe with a towel on her head, julie peeks into her room. nobody there. she sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.}
<B>__{at the sink}
<A>__{julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. she frowns. looks around. some of her things are missing. she peers into the fogged up bathroom mirror. she whips the towel off her head and wipes it across the mirror,}
<B>__{making the bedroom behind her visible.}
<A>__{ready to spit, she looks down. and in that instant we see a shadowy figure pass behind her in the bedroom. she looks back up...and he's gone. julie turns on the water to rinse.}
<B>__{angle on the bedroom door}
<A>__{as it slowly creaks shut, the sound drowned out by the sink.}
