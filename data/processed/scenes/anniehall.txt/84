<A>__{a hollywood christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people, circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks. it's all very casual. french doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, guests move from the room to outside and back in. it is crowded; bits of conversation and clinking glasses can be heard. two men, california tanned, stand by the french doors talking.}
