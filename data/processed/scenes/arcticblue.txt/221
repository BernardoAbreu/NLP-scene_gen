<A>__{it's tomb quiet except for water dripping and pipes creaking. lemalle looks around. the sound of a small ding against metal above him gets his attention. he sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him. he finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder and climbs up. hearing another sound on the far side of the catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for balance. lemalle is directly above the huge central pool. he ducks to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling to a dark corner below. suddenly, the twine snaps tight, pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling. the door swings down and knocks lemalle off the catwalk. with a yelp, he splashes into the water below.}
