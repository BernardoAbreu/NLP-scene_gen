<L>__{interior juke joint night}
<A>__{a ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the mississippi. the band is laying down some serious delta blues, creating an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption. on a far side of the room, ray is playing poker with some locals. he seems to be having a bad night. winston hancock, a formidable black man, sweeps in another big pot and puffs happily on his cigar.}
<B>__{over at the bar}
<A>__{perched on a stool, claude shoots a dark look at ray and motions for the door. ray waves him off and returns to his game. claude becomes aware of a soft, young female hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i've never seen you in here before.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(staring at the hand)}
<D>__{that's because i've never been here before.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i'm sylvia. what's your name?}
<A>__{against his better judgement, claude's gaze follows the long, slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on sylvia's angelic face. he is struck dumb.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{can't you remember your own name?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i know it begins with a "c"...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{well, mr. "c", how about buying a girl a drink?}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{two bourbons.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i really shouldn't. i gotta keep an eye on my friend.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{he looks like he can take care of himself.}
<A>__{the drinks arrive. she places a shot glass in claude's reluctant hand. she winks provocatively and slowly pours the whiskey down her throat. instinctively, claude tosses back his shot.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{claude. that's my name. claude. that's never happened before.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{you're cute. you have any money, claude?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{ten dollars. but i need it to get home.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{why would you want to go home? it's so early.}
<A>__{the bartender refills their glasses.}
<B>__{back at the poker table}
<A>__{winston considers his cards, hardly looking up as a waitress lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of it. he glances at ray, who casually considers his cards.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i will take two.}
<A>__{the dealer tosses ray a couple of cards. insert ray fans his cards to reveal a full house. after considering the other players at the table, ray pushes what's left of his money into the center of the table. the three other players fold with disgust. winston squints long and hard at ray, then pushes everything he has into the center of the table.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{i will see that...}
<A>__{winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more money on the pile.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{and while we're at it, let's sweeten the pot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{looks like my sugar bowl's empty, mr. hancock.}
<C>__{winston}
<P>__{(reaching for the pot)}
<D>__{that's just too damn bad, ain't it?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{now, hang on, slick. i ain't through with you yet.}
<A>__{ray checks his cards again. he looks at the pot, it's a lot of money. with this hand, there's no way he can lose. he places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile. winston checks the time piece.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{that'll cover it.}
<A>__{ray lays down his hand.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{full boat, ladies doing the paddling.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{four threes.}
<A>__{ray sits back, stunned. winston rakes in his winnings. the game is over for the night. the three other players head to the bar.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{don't take it too hard, new york. have a round on me.}
<A>__{winston tosses a silver dollar to ray, who snatches it out of the air. winston drops his hat on his head and moves through the crowd and out the door.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{can i get you something?}
<A>__{ray shakes his head. carefully, she begins to clear the table. suddenly, he grabs her wrist. winston's glass tips over. ray flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of cards.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(wrenching free)}
<D>__{you're hurting my arm.}
