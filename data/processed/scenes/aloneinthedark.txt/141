<L>__{interior mine entrance hall}
<A>__{the agents fire streaks of glowing bullets into the night. flash mines explode close by. a creature leaps out at agent miles. he spins and opens fire. the creature flashes visible as miles riddles it with bullets. the creature flails around, dying. creatures start leaping out at the agents, jumping over the humvee barricades and slashing at agents with their claws. the agents strafe every creature they see. a creature jumps on an agent's back and tears at him. another creature pounces on an agent, ripping him open. dozens of creatures stream into the hall. the agents lay down steady streams of fire, their glowing bullets streaking through the night.}
