<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{still sucking on her finger, claire walks in and begins to clean up the remains of the seance. she bends down to pick up the ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub is again full to the brink of overflowing.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<A>__{claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply. there is only silence. she reaches in to pull the plug, nearly scalding her hand. when she turns for a hand towel she finds a message traced into the steamed up mirror:}
<D>__{"you know"}
<A>__{she draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.}
