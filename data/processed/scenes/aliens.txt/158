<A>__{dollying behind her as she sprints, the walls becoming a frenzied blur. ahead of her burke clears the door to the med lab. he slides it closed. ripley slams into the door. tries the latch. hears it lock from the far side.}

<D>__{burke! open the door!}

<D>__{look!}
<A>__{behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and inhuman as you can imagine. strobe flashes backlight the demented silhouette. shaking, ripley raises her rifle. she squeezes the trigger. nothing happens. the creature hisses, baring its teeth as it advances. ripley checks the safety. the safety is off. the digital counter. the magazine is full. newt begins to wail. ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling so much she almost drops the rifle. panic screams in her brain. the thing is almost on her, filling the corridor, when she remembers. she snaps the bolt back, chambering a round. whips the stock to her shoulder. fires. flash crack! a flashbulb glimpse of shrieking jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching insanely. ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil, blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.}
