<A>__{russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go. oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a music of its own. it's a beautiful and compelling "silence." he thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath of life. his head filling again with the music of the world, he begins to walk down the street. very naturally, and quite randomly, he is noticed by young passersby. they can't help it. he looks like a star. they can't quite figure out who it is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the street. unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought, a small crowd begins to form... following him.}
