<A>__{katherine and thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel entrance. catching their breath. trying to organize and repair the short circuits in their brains. thomas rolls on his side, squints at the sun. katherine's voice is faint and raspy.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what... what was that? hell?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{...no. the voices. they were screaming and fighting over... theology. they don't sweat much about that in hell. but they do in... heaven.}
<A>__{he squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{the son of a bitch. he carries it around with him like a photo album. a big, greasy cloud wherever he goes. they all do.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how can that be heaven? jesus christ. how? i don't even believe in heaven.}
<A>__{the tears start rolling down her face. she looks up and shouts at the endless sky above them.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you dumb fucking assholes! how could you have done that!}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{that extra chapter by st. john was right. it's a war... just like the first one. just like when the angel michael beat lucifer and cast him out. only now they've turned on each other... turned on each other in a civil war over theology.}
<A>__{he laughs hopelessly at the insanity of it all.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{oh sweet god, theology.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{"god's wild bunch".}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{god's morons!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how do you know know so much about that?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i just know.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{yes folks, the good news is that there's life after death in heaven. the bad news is that it's as screwed up as here.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{they were like us.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{they are us. aborted children. and they need us. they need our corrupt, dark souls for their fight. they need...}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{...mary.}
<A>__{katherine climbs abruptly to her feet and walks for the car.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i don't know what this is. i don't know what i believe. i don't know if my sanity is lying back in that cave flopping around waiting for me. but i know one thing. those... those things aren't taking her!}
