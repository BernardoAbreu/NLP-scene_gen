<A>__{water level. the huey, hovering 40 meters away, begins to turn toward us. something rises from the surface scum in close f.g. among the gnarled tree roots. a hulking figure dripping water and mud and strands of swamp weed. rambo. the launcher tube across his shoulder. reverse close on rambo as he wipes filthy water out of his eyes and returns to the scope sight, blinking, taking his time.}

<A>__{the huey's m 60 opens up, walking a parade of waterspouts toward him across the water. rambo fires. with a tremendous backblast the rocket leaps out, a fiery arrow, and strikes the huey square in the canopy. flash! crack! the huey drops into the swamp, its rotors twisting up and flying off. the fuel tanks explode. rambo pivots, reloading. he takes aim and fires again. the rocket roars into the rain forest, the blast sending approaching soldiers scattering. he reloads. fires again, flinching away from the rocket exhaust. his expression is grim, his movements methodical. he pivots again. fires. rounds start hitting around him. he holds position. reloads. fires. beyond the trees, off the river road, the troop trucks are parked. nearby is a refueling truck for the helicopters. rambo's rocket makes a direct hit. a fireball blasts up and out, seeming to fill the jungle.}
