<A>__{the away team materializes in the most striking location on shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge. it is a huge, empty chamber. no furniture. a simple reman mat on the floor is the only decoration. at the very top of the room there is a large, etched glass dome. it is very dark. they turn when shinzon speaks from the shadows:}
<C>__{shinzon }
<D>__{i hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{praetor shinzon?}
<A>__{shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair. the crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human. assuming that he was reman, they're surprised by this realization. shinzon just stares at picard through the darkness for a moment.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{captain picard... jean luc picard... i don't mean to stare, it's just well, you can't imagine how long i've been waiting for this moment. i always imagined you taller, isn't that odd?}

<D>__{you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.}
<A>__{data scans him with a tricorder as:}

<A>__{shinzon laughs, maniacally.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{why have you asked for our presence here?}
<A>__{shinzon does not answer. he is staring deeply at deanna, moans softly.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{praetor?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i've never met a human woman.}

<D>__{i'm only half human.}

<C>__{picard}

<D>__{praetor, we've come to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance. if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation, i suggest you do so now.}

<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{on the world i come from there's no light. no sun. beauty isn't important. i see now there's a world elsewhere.}

<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{unity, captain! tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. federation and romulan. human and vulcan and klingon and reman. i'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. we want peace.}
<A>__{picard and the others are stunned.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i want to end the centuries of mistrust. i want to be your ally, not your enemy. as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and the senate supports you?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{i have dissolved the senate.}

<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. computer, raise lighting four levels.}
<A>__{lights shoot up around the room. for the first time the crew can see shinzon clearly. picard actually gasps when he sees shinzon's face. the rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{allow me to tell you a story that i hope will clarify my position. when i was very young i was stricken with an odd disease. i developed a hyper sensitivity to sound. the slightest whisper caused me agony...}
<A>__{picard watches him carefully. wary and strangely intense.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{no one knew what to do. finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalaft's syndrome. do you know of it, captain?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you know i do.}
<A>__{the crew is dumbfounded at picard's unusual reaction.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{then you know it's a very rare syndrome. genetic. all the male members of my family had it. eventually i was treated. now i can hear as well as you can, captain.}

<P>__{(he stops right before picard)}
<D>__{in fact, i feel exactly what you feel. don't i, jean luc?}
<A>__{picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity. it is as if picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age.}

<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we need to talk, just you and i.}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you know i need to verify this.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the crew is utterly confused. their confusion turns to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood. he hands the knife to data.}

<A>__{picard touches his communicator pin:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{picard to enterprise. five to beam out.}

<D>__{there's no doubt, captain. right down to your regressive strain of shalaft's syndrome. he's a clone.}
<A>__{a beat as the confirmation sinks in.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{when was he... created?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{about twenty five years ago. they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(touching head)}
<D>__{i think a skin cell's the more likely of the two.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{believe me, number one; i'm going to find out. contact starfleet command and inform them of the situation. i need to know where the hell he came from. deanna.}
<A>__{he goes, deanna following.}
<L>__{interior enterprise corridor following}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{i would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. what i could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.}

<D>__{is he sincere about wanting peace?}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(she stops him)}
<D>__{sir, the strongest sense i had was that he's more than curious about you. he very much wants to know you.}

<D>__{the same way you want to know him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how could i not?}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. you should resist the urge to think you know him.}

<D>__{we have time.}
<P>__{(she kisses him)}
<D>__{come to bed.}
<A>__{she pulls him up.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{imzadi, what am i going to do with you?}
<A>__{they kiss deeply. she pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed. it is passionate, erotic. her arms undulate around him sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but something is wrong. riker's hair is now blond. she starts back, her eyes growing wide. riker is gone. she is now embracing shinzon!}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{imzadi. this is so good.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he caresses her face...}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{he can never know you as i know you... he can never touch you as i touch you.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{this isn't real.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{can you feel my hands... are they real? can you feel my lips, my loins?}
<A>__{he kisses her neck but when he raises his head again. it is the monstrous viceroy! holding her. caressing her. she is frozen in horror. but is it the viceroy at all? shinzon's voice seems to come from the viceroy's lips:}
<C>__{shinzon }
<D>__{i'm with you, imzadi...}
<A>__{and then it is shinzon again, kissing her:}
<C>__{shinzon}

<D>__{... then i don't understand the reason for the delay!}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{you don't have to understand.}

<D>__{and bringing the enterprise here?! what possible purpose could that serve?!}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i have a purpose.}

<D>__{then perhaps you will enlighten us?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{silence, romulan!}
<A>__{a tense beat. shinzon regains his composure.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{you must learn patience, commander. do you know where i learned it? in the dilithium mines of remus. spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a romulan guard's whip and you'll soon understand patience.}
<C>__{suran}
<P>__{(carefully bows his head)}
<D>__{praetor.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{now go. i have some personal business.}
<A>__{suran and the others go. donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees the viceroy going to shinzon. and then do something odd. the viceroy puts his hand on shinzon's chest, leans very close and talks to him quietly. this is an ancient form of reman telepathic medical diagnosis. this strange sight perplexes donatra. the doors close, blocking her view...}
<L>__{interior senate corridor following}
<A>__{we go with donatra and the other romulans. donatra speaks quietly to suran:}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{as happens so frequently here on romulus, a new government came to power. they decided to abandon the plan frankly, i think they were afraid i'd be discovered and it would lead to war. they weren't ready for that.}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not quite. i envy the hairline.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{a lifetime of violence will do that. my nose was broken four times. and my jaw... but so much is the same. the eyes, you recognize the eyes.}

<D>__{yes. the eyes have it.}

<D>__{... i was a slave. and a monster. the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me. but one man took pity on me: the man who became my viceroy. he taught me how to survive. and in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, i found my reman brothers. they showed me the only kindness i ever knew.}

<D>__{for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister planet... but the time has come for us to live as equals.}
