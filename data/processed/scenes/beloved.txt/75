<L>__{interior kitchen another evening.}
<A>__{camera moves up from the mended legs of the table paul broke to; a suspicious paul glares at beloved as they eat dinner. beloved is ever ready to pass sethe a bowl or napkin or whatever she needs. she is "shining" for sethe, and for sethe alone. denver notices it as well. it is raining outside. both denver and beloved are wet from the rain. denver's hair is all tangled.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{best unbraid that hair.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{today's always here. tomorrow never.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{it hurts.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{comb it everyday, it won't..}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{your woman never fixed up your hair?}
<A>__{all three look to beloved, puzzled by her question, which is clearly intended for sethe. paul's getting more annoyed.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{my woman?..you mean my mother?}
<A>__{beloved nods. paul and denver exchange a curious look.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{if she did i don't remember. i don't think i saw her but a few times.}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{tell me 'bout her.}
<A>__{paul and denver look to sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{..i remember once, she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse... the only thing i do remember in fact...}
<A>__{paul is disturbed by sethe's carefree storytelling how it contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it will lead to no good... once again, denver is surprised to hear what she's never heard before. she looks to paul and knows what he is thinking. paul looks back and knows denver realizes it. but denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the eyes.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{...she opened up her dress and right on her rib, right here, was a circle and a cross burnt right into the skin....}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(interrupts her)}
<D>__{sethe.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{any more beans?}
<A>__{sethe rises to get him more food and she continues:}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{...anyway, she points to this mark and says to me "this is your ma'am. i am the only one whose got this mark now. the rest all dead. if something happens to me and you can't tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark"..scared me so... i couldn't think of anything to say so i said "yes ma'am..but how will you know us? mark me too. mark the mark on me too."}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{did she?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no. she slapped my face. i didn't understand it then. not until i had a mark of my own...}
<A>__{paul is disturbed. he can see sethe getting upset. he is mad at beloved for her damn questions..}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{what happened to her?}
<A>__{something inside of sethe stops, a wall erected. something unwanted is coming into her consciousness. paul notices it. she rises;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{don't know. everybody done?}
<A>__{sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as paul asks:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, as long as we're all asking questions, getting to know each other..}
<P>__{(to beloved)}
<D>__{why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?}
<A>__{camera follows sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the dish inside. we hear the others o.s.:}
<C>__{denver }
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{she don't remember nothing.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{you be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking.}
<C>__{beloved }
<D>__{can i have some more pudding?}
<A>__{camera stays on sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table. she is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the memory being relived in her yard; pov out the window;}
