<L>__{interior courtroom, small town vermont}
<A>__{there are three key witnesses called to the stand: captain medley, starks' commanding officer in the persian gulf; dr. hale, a psychiatrist; and officer nash, the cop who first came upon the crime scene. their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against starks quickly and confusingly just like it appears to himself.}
<D>__{officer nash [emotional] eddie [correcting himself], officer harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood on his back.}
<C>__{dr. hale}
<D>__{william starks could be blocking the incident. it would explain his well systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. a delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this. officer nash [cont'd] officer harrison'd been shot three times. he was long dead by the time we got there.}

<D>__{i have heard of gulf war syndrome. the medical community is only beginning to gather information about it.}
<C>__{prosecution}
<D>__{gulf war syndrome? what the...why don't we start diagnosing hard life syndrome while we're at it? i've gotten a lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic...}
<C>__{captain medley}
<D>__{sergeant starks was awarded the purple heart. that award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [beat] it applauds honor. dr. hale [cont'd] his subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then.}
<A>__{the following summations are punctuated by the black fades between them and the simulated black around them as they speak like starks, at the beginning of his own testimony.}
<D>__{prosecution [disdainfully] it's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! he absolutely was. three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. captain medley [incensed] war isn't a cnn special. half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. it was ugly. and they don't put ugly on tv. [looking at starks] if starks did kill that officer ... [beat] you can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind.}
<C>__{defense}
<D>__{for god's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once. he doesn't know what's going on.}
