<L>__{interior squad room same time}
<A>__{outside the office hallenbeck and jimmy are perched side by side on a wooden bench. jimmy is crumpling pieces of paper and tossing them at a wastebasket. he throws with unerring accuracy. beside him hallenbeck frowns, deep in thought. finally, jimmy speaks:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{that stuff cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. that was all bullshit, wasn't it...?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{yeah. i don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight. mob style.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me about cory. what was she like?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{none of your fucking business.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{listen up, friend. i'm trying to get a handle on this. how was she fixed for money?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't know. pretty strapped, i guess.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{always kept an eye out for work?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no hooking, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{it isn't. tell me what she did at the club, besides dance.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{the usual. waitressing. get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{she get many high rollers?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{sure. even rich guys get lonely.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{fine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her... reveals something about himself. something that could hurt if it came out. what would she do?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{would she blackmail him?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{jesus, i've had about enough of you }
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{would she consider the possibility of blackmail?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{she'd consider it. if she could get away with it. but she'd need hard evidence. otherwise, it's 'i never said that,' his word against hers.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{right. so what does she do?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't know. follow the guy? have him followed?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{bingo. kid, this is making sense. she hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{who does she hire?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{ah. she hires my buddy mike.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{right? right. it makes sense. except }
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{except you told me that mike was a shitty surveillance man.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{exactly. he got spotted. they made him, and they killed him. then they took out cory.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{christ, what did the two of them stumble onto?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{whatever it was, it was way over their heads. they knew they were in trouble.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how you figure?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{because mike was scared. he bailed out and threw the case in my lap.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{he handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was?}
<A>__{hallenbeck stares straight ahead. sighs and says:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{he was fucking my wife, jimmy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i die. he gets my wife.}
<A>__{jimmy just looks at him. at that moment, mccaskey pokes his head out of bessalo's office.}
<D>__{mccaskey okay, you guys are cleared to go. pick up belongings at the property desk.}
