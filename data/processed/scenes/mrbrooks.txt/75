<A>__{in slow motion atwood flies through the air while at normal speed the van is leaving her behind. smash! butt first, atwood hammers into the back window of a parked car. the shattering glass breaks her fall. groggily she rolls out of the indentation. gun still in hand and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the car to stand in the street. the van is nowhere in sight.}
