<L>__{interior visitation room, psych hospital day}
<A>__{restrained in a straitjacket, edward is brought in by two orderlies who seat him at a table opposite emily and then exit. jaw wired, everything he says is spoken through clenched teeth.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i know i'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're...}
<A>__{his stare unnerves her. she stops and collects herself.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you're the only one i can talk to. lucy's been staying with me }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{who died?}
<A>__{emily falls silent. her voice cracks with emotion.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{a friend.}
<A>__{edward nods yup. regards her in silence. emily speaks, or tries to, just to fill that awful void.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i, ummm...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you're scared.}
<A>__{emily, skewered again, nods yes.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you oughta be.}
<A>__{dead silence. she meets his gaze. and there is eye contact, true understanding.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you judged us before you ever walked in that house. sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{ask what you came to ask.}
<A>__{after a moment:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what is she?}
<A>__{it's a question edward has asked himself once or twice. he leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost casual air.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{can tell you what she's not. she not a daughter of mine. she's not a ten year old having trouble in school. she's not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved. and she's not going no place, lady, till she's good and done with you.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{done with me how?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{however she wants. you think it's an accident her ending up with you? she saw you coming a mile away.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{why me? i don't have anything.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you have that you're good. kindness. decency. that's what she feeds on. bleeds ya dry, moves onto the nexterior we were a big family, she went through us like a wrecking ball. and you know, every time something happened, every time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't her fault. cuz it's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl. but finally we got to a point where me and maggy looked at each other }
<P>__{(remembers so clearly)}
<D>__{ where we looked at each other and we was out of lies, both of us. most terrifying moment of our lives. and that's where you are now.}
<A>__{emily silently registering this truth.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will tell you this. she sees everything. and what she doesn't see she just sort of senses it, like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{only time you got the upper hand is when she's sleepin' but she almost never does. we checked on her every night for three months. every twenty minutes, up and down those stairs. first time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door.}
<A>__{after a moment:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what does she want?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{to know... what your idea of hell is... and make you live there.}
<A>__{emily sits in haunted silence. edward's features soften.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm not a hateful man. i look at you and i wish i could tell you you're through the worst of it. that it's gonna work out for you in the end. i wish i could.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what should i do?}
<A>__{a pitying smile reveals edward's wired teeth.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how strong's your faith?}
