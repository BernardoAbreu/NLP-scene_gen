<L>__{interior bedroom (daly city) night}
<A>__{dim light. the room is unattractive, over furnished but not comfortably. a woman is sitting propped up in a double bed. she is in her mid thirties, but drained and pale, she looks older. a chronic invalid. by her side is a nasty little dog, with ribbon bows in its fur. near the bed is a tv and video, on which a movie's final credits are running.}
<B>__{the woman is impatiently pushing an intercom button}
<A>__{peter enters. younger than the woman, rather good looking. boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near his hairline. an old scar. he goes straight to tv and puts the tape on 'eject.'}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{why don't we save it for later? it's almost time for letterman.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you know i don't like to watch talk shows by myself. where're you?}
<A>__{he inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.' then he approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a lock of hair back from the forehead. she ignores him, staring at the screen. the nasty little}
<B>__{dog bares its teeth and snaps at him.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{see, now you've annoyed her. you know she doesn't like you to touch me.}
<P>__{(to dog)}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{she doesn't lie! you sure you fed her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{she lies all the time. why would i say i fed her if i didn't?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's what i don't know. why would you lie? that's the problem... i can't understand why anyone would lie.}
<A>__{he leaves. as he goes we can hear the woman still talking to her dog over the tv soundtrack.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{you wouldn't lie to mummy, would you? just to get dad in trouble? such a naughty widdle dog...}
<A>__{her voice fades away as we follow him down the stairs into a small, ill lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen, then through a door leading to the basement. he locks the basement door behind him. the basement is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets and computers. as he approaches the bottom stair, we see a small tv video set attached to a wall. on its screen, freeze framed and silent, is a video of a pretty girl at an outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively. peter puts on a white lab coat and then reaches over something to turn the video back on. the camera pans down to what he has leaned across. it is the young girl from the concert. she is strapped onto a table, her mouth taped shut. a plastic bag covers her head, but not tightly. she is semiconscious. she is being asphyxiated by slow degrees. peter looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made toward his wife. he whispers:}

<D>__{didn't i promise i'd come right back?}
