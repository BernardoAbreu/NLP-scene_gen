<L>__{interior dead reckoning night}
<A>__{riley and mike step into a tight, uncomfortable space. generators whir. gears turn. the two men open a storage locker and strap on ammo belts as... ...something terrible looms out of the shadows! it moves toward riley and mike, who can't see it from behind the locker. the left side of the thing's face has been burned away. only scar tissue remains, and a single usable eye bulging from a socket. riley turns. sees the thing. and, surprisingly, he relaxes, recognizing charlie houk, a heavily armed guerilla whose intellect is as burned as his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tcha doin', riley?}
<C>__{riley}

<D>__{you learned how to make yourself useful. that's what they're doing.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{they dumped the trash. cholo's on his way.}
<A>__{riley and mike look across the room in the direction of the voice. twenty feet away, a woman sits at the controls of what looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with a mixture of high and low tech equipment. she wears a black leather jacket with "pretty boy" emblazoned across the back.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(surprised) pretty boy's a dame?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{this one is. last one was a guy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<A>__{pretty boy turns, poking her finger through a bullet hole encrusted with year old blood in the chest of her jacket.}
<C>__{pretty boy}
<D>__{i kept his jacket. for good luck.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{luck?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{put some flowers in the graveyard.}
<A>__{pretty boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the control panel. thoomb! thoomb! deep concussive sounds can be felt as much as heard as...}
