<L>__{interior theater backstage}
<A>__{giant fossils of antique stage scenery. utility lights high above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged forms of light and black.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(unsteady)}
<D>__{stephen. game's up. come on out. let's blow this one hat town.}
<A>__{silence. then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly lighting stephen's face. shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood. bloom cries and rushes towards him...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no! no bloom, freeze.}
<A>__{he obeys. stephen is tied to a chair. a dark figure behind him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{stephen, who is it? is it the dog?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{did penelope wire the money?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{they're calling to check right now. don't move. i'm alright.}
<A>__{the dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear for a moment then flips it closed. something happens in the blackness, and stephen shakily stands, cut loose.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{stay where you are, bloom. i'm coming to you.}
<A>__{he takes a couple wobbly steps. behind him, bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun towards stephen's back, pulling the hammer... and the utility lamp switches off.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into the blackness. stephen drops flat to the ground. the fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness, strobing the scene like stage lightning. bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but stephen lies on his stomach out in the open.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{stephen!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{stay back!}
<A>__{but bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open, unloading three more rounds into the dark. the dark figure returns fire on bloom, who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light. a sitting duck. stephen launches himself up, tackling bloom backwards. just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red burst of blood flowers from stephen's left lower back. bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind him. he turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by, through the torn backdrop. bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby. silence. bloom walks back to stephen, who lies behind the flat, breathing heavy. blood soaking through his shirt.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{please tell me this is all gonna be ok. tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what i always wanted and pulled off the perfect con.}
<A>__{a long, long moment. stephen coughs, spits. then a wry grin spreads across his face.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you said it, not me.}
<A>__{he stands, the shakiness gone.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{can i get a `wow' for this one?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he embraces him, crying. the brothers bloom stay like that for a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow. finally stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes. he wipes them, wipes blood from his lip.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{tastes like tin foil. alright here's what i want you to do. the chink split?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{yeah. clean exit.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{car bomb.}
<A>__{a hint of relief in stephen's face.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{good. here's what. take penelope back to helsinki, take that flight to rio. lay low like we said. play out the on the run from vengeful russians thing, that'll be fun for her. play it like i'm dead, actually that'll add some gravity to everything, that'll be nice. and i will see you when i see you.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{soon?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i hope not. last thing you need is me hanging around. anyway, how could i top this?}
<A>__{bloom hugs him again.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i love you. bye.}
<A>__{he turns to go.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey. think of any card.}
<A>__{stephen pulls out a pack of cards.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{stephen cuts, to the queen of hearts.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{stephen. that's it.}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{that's the best card trick i've ever seen. i just wish you had a bigger audience.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're the only audience i've ever needed.}
<A>__{wink. bloom leaves. stephen watches him go.}
