<L>__{interior enterprise observation lounge night}
<A>__{picard is gathered with his senior officers. a computer display illustrates geordi's words about the power of shinzon's weapon. we see a chilling graphic of the biogenic pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole planet.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{it's called a cascading biogenic pulse. the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{and that's exactly what he's going to do.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{his hatred of the federation is apparent. he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. he is going after earth.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{oh boy. destroy humanity and the federation is crippled...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and the romulans invade.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{how can you be certain?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i know how he thinks.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(to geordi)}
<D>__{and there's no way to penetrate his cloak?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{he could pass within 10 meters of every ship in starfleet and they'd never know.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{but we do have one advantage.}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{he needs your blood to live. he might come after you first.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm counting on it... we've been ordered to head to sector 3274. starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{strength in numbers?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we can only hope so.}
<A>__{a beat as he looks at them gravely.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{he can't be allowed to use that weapon. all other concerns are secondary. do you understand me?}
<A>__{riker knows exactly what picard is saying: the enterprise is expendable.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{picard stands. presses a comm button.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{all hands. battle stations.}
