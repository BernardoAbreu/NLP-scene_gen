<A>__{cole comes awake with a start. he stares, disoriented, at the catfood commercial on the tv.}
<C>__{railly's voice }
<D>__{please untie me. i'm very uncomfortable.}
<A>__{cole turns to railly, beside him on the bed, frightened and helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait jacket. cole's instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his impulse. he looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the dresser, stepping around empty fast food cartons. he pulls a razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.}
