<L>__{exterior arroyo}
<A>__{near noon. the sun blisters a landscape out of time. the white cessna rockets above the saguaros, its shadow pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some manic alter ego below it. it wooshes over us, raising dust devils.}
<L>__{interior plane}
<A>__{the pilot yells over his shoulder to bodhi...}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{look, we been in mexico the last half hour... can i quit mowing the lawn here or what? i'm getting more brush in the wheels than i usually like, you know what i'm saying?!}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{yeah, get some height. take her up to eight thousand on this heading.}
<A>__{the pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs. bodhi moves back next to roach, who's fading.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{we're gonna pop up on their screens.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{doesn't matter now. we're almost there, man. here, let me help you get your gear on.}
<A>__{bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to roach and starts helping him into the harness. roach keeps the shot gun pointed at johnny.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{i'm cold.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{you're gonna be fine. just fine. johnny, toss me that money bag will you. easy does it.}
<A>__{utah hefts the duffel. weighs its contents, and their price.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you're cold because all the blood is running out of your body, roach. you're going to be dead soon.}
<P>__{(he tosses the bag)}
<D>__{i hope it was worth it.}
<A>__{roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a teddy bear. glares at utah. he hooks the strap of the duffel over one shoulder.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{hey, johnny's just trying to psych you man, forget it. just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin' you back to health. come on, amigo, let's get you set for the jump.}
<A>__{bodhi props roach next to the open door and takes a walkie talkie from the seat, keying it.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{rosie, rosie, this is air force one, do you copy, over?}
<A>__{a burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear voice.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{copy you, air force one. we have a visual on you. lookin' fine.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{tell him to release tyler.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{why should i?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what if your chute fails, bodhi? rescind the order. let her off the hook, she's served her purpose. do it, man, you owe me that much. let me hear it before you check out.}
<A>__{bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of seconds, then keys the walkie.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{rosie, listen carefully. surgery is canceled, is that clear? repeat it back to me.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{copy you. surgery is canceled. i'm lettin' the bitch go.}
<A>__{bodhi looks out the doorway. gauging distance, airspeed, the geography below. he looks at utah, aiming the casull at him. johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{i know it's hard for you johnny. you want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth. but not his time.}
<P>__{(he braces roach at the door)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{bodhi signals the pilot and utah feels the plane drop as the engines are cut back to an idle. bodhi slaps roach on the shoulder and roach slumps backward out of the plane. bodhi braces to jump, looking at johnny for a last split second.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{you lose, campadre.}
<A>__{he chucks the casull onto the seat beside the door and bails. bodhi tumbles out into space. it's over. utah's knuckles are white, gripping the seat. there's a dynamo, spinning out of control in his head. he leaps up in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a bulkhead. looks around like a rabid animal. two seconds. three seconds. then...}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{fuck it!!!}
<A>__{utah grabs the casull off the seat and dives out of the plane.}
