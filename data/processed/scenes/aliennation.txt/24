<L>__{interior detective squad room day}
<A>__{sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee. he's slept about four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with hagler. he crosses straight to fedorchuk's desk.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{so what've you got on tuggle's killers?}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{jesus, sykes it's been less than ten hours. me and alterez are on it, okay?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you don't have squat.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{you ever try to make a case in slagtown? the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes...}
<C>__{alterez}
<D>__{up yours.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{... nobody talks to nobody down there. half of them don't speak english and the other half only when it suits them. it's gonna take some time.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, i know it's gonna take time. like until the ice capades opens in hell, with you two on it.}
<A>__{across the room, the captain's door bangs open and captain warner pounds out, his deep voice booming through the squad room.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{nobody wanders off! i got an announcement. get your asses back in here.}
<A>__{two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into the room. everybody gathers around, curious, as warner stands holding a sheet of paper.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{i will make this short. this is a directive from chief evaner, who is acting on orders from the mayor, who is under mandate from the federal bureau of newcomer relations. as of nine o'clock this morning, one newcomer uniform officer has been promoted to the rank of detective, third grade.}
<A>__{the detectives groan... some angrier ones grumble, "this is bullshit!", etc.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{and we've got him, gentleman.}
<P>__{(more groans)}
<D>__{volunteers for duty with the new detective should see me in my office... otherwise i will choose a volunteer myself. that is all.}
<A>__{he turns and heads back to his office in the wake of continued grumbling from the detectives. sykes, standing to one side, absently watches warner return to his glass walled office. waiting inside are a balding man and an alien in a grey suit. sykes reacts. the alien in the suit is jetson. the grumbling continues around him as sykes considers something.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{unbelievable bullshit.}
<C>__{alterez}
<D>__{how long has this slag been on the force? a year, max right?}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{i don't know about the rest of you, but i sure as hell ain't gonna sit still for this. i'm calling the union, pronto.}
<A>__{others grumble. "yeah!". meanwhile, sykes has decided something. he heads toward warner's office. fedorchuk sees this.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{where the hell is he going?}
