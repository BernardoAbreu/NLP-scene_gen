<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{a dark and severe conference room, with large screen computer displays at one end. glowering at one end of the long, polished table, is spencer trilby, the chief of omega sector. visualize a cross between colin powel and j. edgar hoover.}
<C>__{trilby}
<D>__{jesus, harry! you guys really screwed the pooch last night. please tell me how i can look at this, that it's not a total pooch screw.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{total is a strong word }
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{there are degrees of totality.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{it's a scale really, with "perfect mission" on one end and "total pooch screw" on the other and we're more about here }
<C>__{trilby}
<D>__{faisil. you're new on harry's team, aren't you?}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{trilby}
<D>__{so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you?!}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{sorry, sir. uh... here's what we got.}
<A>__{he hits a button and a photo of khaled fills a wall screen.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{jamal khaled. we think he's dirty so we raid his financial files... check it out...}
<A>__{faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{one hundred million in wire transfers from the commerce bank international }
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist activities. something big is going down }
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{and we know that a week ago four mirv warheads were smuggled out of the former soviet republic of kazakhstan . . .}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we think khaled's group has bought the nukes and is bringing them to u.s. soil.}
<C>__{trilby}
<D>__{so far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentleman. do you have anything remotely substantial? don't be pumping beets up my ass here. do you have hard data?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not what you'd call rock hard.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{it's pretty limp, actually.}
<C>__{trilby}
<D>__{then perhaps you better get some ... before somebody parks a car in front of the white house with a nuclear weapon in the trunk!}
