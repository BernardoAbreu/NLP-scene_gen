<D>__{jenny is making david a cup of tea. her mother is keeping an eye on jenny in marjorie's mind at least, this is a rehearsal for something.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i haven't put my...my stamp on it yet. haven't had time. it needs a woman's touch, really. and if you don't like it, we can move. just say the word.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{where is the flat again?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{you have to put the cosy on straight away. jenny sighs and rolls her eyes. she picks up the hand knitted tea cosy and puts it on her head.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{like that? david laughs.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{no. on the tea pot.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{ah. she puts the tea cosy on the tea pot.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just down from russell square. two minutes' walk from the underground.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jenny! we could walk to...(she tries to think of somewhere jenny might find interesting.) we could walk to the british museum!}
<A>__{jenny gives her a look.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i will leave you to it. don't let it stew.}
<A>__{she leaves the room.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{and this is where you're living?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i've stayed there for the last couple of nights. (beat) on and off.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you've stayed there two nights "on and off"?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{is that tea ready? one sugar, please.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(frustrated by his evasions)}
<D>__{david!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm sorry. you must think i'm very odd.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no, but.... you seem to float around. i never know where you are.}
<A>__{she hands him his tea.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a wandering jew.(he pauses to take a sip.) if i tell you something, will you promise not to laugh?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it depends on how funny it is.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{i live at home.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we all live at home.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no. i mean...i live at home...in the same way that you live at home.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{but i live with my mother and fa...(it clicks.) you don't mean it.}
<A>__{david nods, shamefacedly.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{your mother and father?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just my mother. my father's dead. i've been meaning to tell you, minnie, and it would have been much better than all those silly lies. but...}
<A>__{he looks quite upset. we warm to him. jenny leans over and takes his hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{anyway. you can see how much i need you. and you won't regret this, i promise. we'll have so much fun. and just think. when we get married, you won't have to wait in the car while i do my business.. you'll be waiting at home, looking at the burne jones on the wall. home, minnie. our home. can you imagine?}
<A>__{close on jenny. she can't imagine, really.}
