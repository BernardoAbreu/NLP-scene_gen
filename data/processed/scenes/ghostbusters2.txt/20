<L>__{interior tv studio corridor day (later)}
<A>__{venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, norman, a well meaning young incompetent.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{where do you find these people? i thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{a lot of the better psychics won't come on the show. they think you're too skeptical.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{skeptical! norman, i'm a pushover. i think professional wrestling is real.}
<A>__{there is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they just interviewed the mayor on 'cityline.'}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{the mayor! he's a friend of mine.}
<A>__{venkman starts down the hall as the mayor and his principal aide, jack hardemeyer, come walking out of the studio.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(calling to the mayor)}
<D>__{lenny!}
<A>__{the mayor sees venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know him.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(starts to follow him)}
<D>__{lenny! it's pete venkman!}
<A>__{the plainclothesmen cut venkman off and hardemeyer puts a heavy hand against venkman's chest.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<P>__{(snide)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(dangerous)}
<D>__{yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.}
<A>__{hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<D>__{i'm jack hardemeyer. i'm the mayor's assistant. what can i do for you?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i'm an old friend of the mayor's. i just want to say hello to him.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<P>__{(scornful)}
<D>__{i know who you are, doctor venkman. busting any ghosts lately?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{no, that's what i want to talk to the mayor about. we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<P>__{(bristling)}
<D>__{look, you stay away from the mayor. next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends. you read me?}
<A>__{hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{okay, i get it. but i want you to tell lenny that, because of you, i'm not voting for him.}
