<A>__{john walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways. burnt out husks of long forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. a low drone penetrates the silence.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is she here?}
<A>__{on the horizon is a dying red sun. it strains to cut through the putrid brown haze.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is she here?!}
<A>__{his voice reverberates to infinity. john cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below. they're crammed with teeming masses of the damned. all walking down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is she here?!}
<A>__{that low drone rises in pitch and john now spots a huge blanket like blackness crawling over the cityscape, rapidly closing in on him. you get the feeling this isn't a safe place for the living.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's a simple question! is she here or not?!!}
<A>__{john suddenly locks on something far off. on top of a distant skyscraper is a female figure in a sheer white gown. john can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{isabel?}
<A>__{she lifts something and tosses it. john watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness.}
