<A>__{the stone house is nothing like a stereotypical tudor house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in design. it faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting the noblemen off for a week end get away.}
<L>__{interior cecil house great hall dusk}
<A>__{most of england's nobility is assembled in small groups, talking. it's a dour, quiet affair. some music, no life. quite puritan. southampton is there, but essex and oxford are nowhere to be seen. a hunch backed man makes his way through the room, causing conversations to cease as he walks by. even the most senior of the nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. this is sir robert cecil (mid 30's). he pauses near southampton.}

<D>__{with your father in london dealing with all the troubles in ireland, who else should the queen turn to but essex?}

<A>__{open, and elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. she is wearing a large sparkling pearl encrusted dress with a wide collar. she walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. she seems un certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her (alzheimer's?). and she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un human. essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel encrusted doublet. robert cecil frowns at the sight of essex on her arm. essex ignores cecil's glare, notices southampton }

<D>__{ah majesty, i've been told my lord of southampton has a gift for you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}

<D>__{yes, your grace, though not from me.}
<A>__{southampton claps his hands and a door across the room}
<B>__{opens.}
<A>__{a dwarf enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music. elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face. robert cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{are you this gift, my precious little man?}
<C>__{dwarf}
<D>__{no, no, my most majestic majesty. i am a free man. my gift is a play, majesty.}

<C>__{robert cecil}
<P>__{(to the dwarf)}
<D>__{plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication, and heresy. you may tell your master that her majesty }
<C>__{essex}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{ will gladly accept your gift.}
<A>__{robert cecil turns to essex, shocked.}

<D>__{of course that is if you so desire, majesty.}

<D>__{the choice is her majesty's to make, not yours. is that not so sir robert?}
<A>__{robert frowns as elizabeth looks around, unsure of the political tides around her. then }
