<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{i forgot the napkins.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{and the chopsticks and fortune cookies?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{what's the best fortune you ever got?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{they're all the same. "financial security is around the corner." "your friends love you."}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{in kowloon, once, i got one that said, "live now because life is dust."}
<A>__{crockett and isabella wander down the beach, hard from the ebb tide.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{do you have assets somewhere else? bank accounts?}

<D>__{'cause whatever can go wrong, will...?}
<A>__{the perseids make the night sky over the water look like the fourth of july.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{something like that. the odds catch up with you. the odds are like gravity. you can't negotiate with them.}

<C>__{isabella}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{is this the protective male talk?}
<C>__{crockett}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{this is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk. he would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{and if i were in the comoros, in the indian ocean, where would you be...?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{a few more moments, still in this business. then i'd find you.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{would you? because if you couldn't, i would be very lonely... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen.}
<P>__{(smiles, touches crockett)}
<D>__{but none of this will happen. so it doesn't matter. because we are on the guajira peninsula. and all you see around you...look around... is archangel de jesus montoya londono. he is my man. and you are a smuggler moving a load...}
<A>__{her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will disregard them. life is dust. meaning is in the moment, and that's right now. the intensity is because it's impossible. because it's impossible, they've been free to imagine. and that's made the heat of it stronger...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{...in the morning.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{i will be on board by noon.}
<A>__{crockett didn't expect that.}
<C>__{isabella }
