<L>__{interior stu's living room day}
<A>__{the entire monkeybone brain trust has come to visit: herb, syndicate head mr. bowers, and several corporate reps hoping to arrange tie in deals. host stu bone has started to take on a simian look: more prominent ears, flared nostrils, heavy beard stubble, etc. the burger god rep sets a tray of fast food in front of stu bone the packaging all covered with angelic haloed monkeybones.}
<C>__{burger god rep}
<D>__{as you know, burger god has 1700 outlets nationwide...we're prepared to back a major tv buy to launch our mega monkey meal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{go ahead. try a bite.}
<A>__{stu bone takes a bite out of his monkeyburger looks pleased at first then begins picking something out of his teeth.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{what's the matter? stu bone i think it's a pig hair.}
<P>__{(examining a contract)}
<D>__{how much is mcdonald's offering?}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{less.}
<A>__{stu bone immediately signs the contract and shakes hands with the burger god rep. herb consults his agenda.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{oh, here's something. the city zoo is kicking off a fund raising campaign. they wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit. stu bone how much?}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{well, nothing. it's a benefit. but we could probably get people and entertainment tonight to cover it. stu bone i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he's got a little something i think you'll like.}
<A>__{the toy rep sets a lockbox on the table. a stencil on the box reads "top secret." he pulls out a key and opens it to reveal... ...a tuxedoed, collector's edition monkeybone doll lying on a bed of crushed purple velvet. he carefully removes the treasure from its chest. its right hand is hinged. the doll's thumb is up its rear.}
<C>__{bazoom toy rep}
<D>__{it's a prototype. code name "little jack horner." go on pull out his thumb.}
<A>__{stu bone stares at the doll cautiously yanks its thumb out. we go to slo mo as the rising arm causes a noxious aerosol spray to shoot out of monkeybone's ass! and we stay in slo mo as stu bone stares at the doll in wonderment and awe...a man in looooove. still in slo mo, the execs crack up, gag, hold their noses at the awful stank of it. stu bone is the only one not laughing. he reaches out to touch the doll to fondle it adoringly and suddenly we're back to real time.}
<C>__{bazoom toy rep}
<D>__{you know kids they love anything gross... stu bone kids? kids?! this is a work of genius. this is art. this is the answer to all my prayers!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{say just a technical question could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution of one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water?}
<C>__{bazoom exec}
<D>__{well i guess... stu bone aww righhhhht!}
<A>__{he breaks into riotous laughter and begins blasting monkeyfarts at herb and the execs, who dive for cover under the conference table.}
