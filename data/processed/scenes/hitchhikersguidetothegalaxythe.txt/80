<A>__{the dullest office environment ever. a counter with few vogons behind it, mindlessly moving bits of paper around. the front doors burst open. arthur storms through them, holding marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a gun. he trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again, trying hard to look tough. ford and zaphod follow, zaphod wearing the thinking cap and sunglasses for disguise. ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit. the vogons look up, nonplussed.}

<D>__{prisoner release department. six buildings down, out the door, right, left, then two rights. big gray building, can't miss it.}
