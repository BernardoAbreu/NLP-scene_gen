<L>__{interior paul's apartment. bedroom day}
<B>__{blinding whiteness}
<A>__{we hear a man gasping softly. rhythmically. a luminous pale shape slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. gradually we realize we're moving across the alabaster body of a woman. her skin translucent. on the woman's face ethereal. her eyes closed. her face lifeless. then... ...her eyes open. she looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. this is anna (late 20s). we pull back. paul (30s) makes love to anna. their movements perfunctory. passionless. he turns to look at her. realizes she's not there. he suddenly stops. rolls off her. sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{anna leans down and picks up her red slip from the floor.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(sighs wearily)}
<D>__{you used to enjoy it. now it's...}
<A>__{he shakes his head. frustrated. lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{...it's like fucking a corpse.}
<A>__{paul immediately realizes he's gone too far. turns to anna.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{shit. i'm sorry. that was }
<A>__{anna gets out of bed. walks towards the bathroom. paul puts his head in his hands.}
<L>__{interior paul's apartment. bathroom moments later}
<A>__{through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of anna. paul walks in.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna. i'm sorry. that was a stupid thing to say. but you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. like you're somewhere else.}
<A>__{anna doesn't reply.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{is this about us?}
<B>__{on anna}
<A>__{her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's not about us.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i just want us to be happy.}
<A>__{anna doesn't move. we sense the emptiness inside her.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{are you happy?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes. forces herself to reply.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm happy.}
<B>__{a drop of blood}
<A>__{falls into the water. then another drop.}
<B>__{on anna}
<A>__{her nose is bleeding. she touches her lips. looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. the sound of water carries into the next scene...}
<T>__{fade to white:}
<B>__{a stream of crystal blue water}
<A>__{a man's hands penetrate the water. thin and elegant. perfectly manicured. turning slowly as he washes them meticulously. he picks up a crisply folded white towel. dries his hands carefully. snaps on white latex gloves.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery morning}
<A>__{a beautiful morning. we move through a tranquil cemetery. pastoral and idyllic. dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels.}
<L>__{exterior funeral home continuous}
<A>__{a path leads to an old well kept house. amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign: eliot deane. funeral home.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. casket display room morning}
<A>__{sun streams into an elegant wood panelled room. the funeral director, eliot deane (40s) guides mrs. ayres (70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux marble pedestals. he's a serene man. quiet and professional.}

<D>__{or perhaps the aegean? solid bronze exterior. hand brushed finish with grecian bronze highlights.}
<C>__{mrs. ayres}
<D>__{the antique carlisle. definitely the antique carlisle.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(writes in his notebook)}

<D>__{you'll look beautiful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now about the service. would you like a private visitation?}
<A>__{mrs. ayres is miles away.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{mrs. ayres?}
<C>__{mrs. ayres}
<D>__{i'm sorry. yes. a private visitation.}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{mr. deane? what happens when we die?}
<A>__{eliot chooses his words carefully.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{it's different every time. each person dies in their own way.}
<L>__{int exterior anna's car morning}
<A>__{anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town in a green toyota. on the dashboard a kitschy bobblehead doll nods its head from side to side. anna pulls up to a red light. glances across at the other cars. we see the vacant faces of commuters staring blankly into space. the light changes. anna hasn't noticed. the car behind her honks in frustration. she quickly pulls out... ... just as a suv turns in front of her. she slams on her brakes. hard. missing the suv by inches. the driver screams at her. his face contorted in ugly rage.}
<L>__{exterior elementary school. parking lot morning}
<A>__{anna locks her car. heads towards the main building.}
<L>__{interior elementary school. corridor morning}
<A>__{classes have started. jack (11), a serious looking boy, walks through a silent corridor. up ahead two older boys, a tall kid and a kid with acne, push a geeky boy against a locker. jack tries to pass by unnoticed.}
<C>__{tall kid}
<D>__{hey. jack off!}
<A>__{jack walks faster. the two older boys set off after him. he darts into a corridor. ducks into an empty classroom.}
<L>__{interior elementary school. biology classroom moments later}
<A>__{jack waits anxiously by the door. it looks like he's lost the bullies. then a sudden rustling noise makes him jump. he turns. tiny chicks huddle in a plastic incubator on a table. jack moves over to them.}
<C>__{tall kid }
<D>__{didn't you hear me jack off?}
<A>__{jack swivels round. the tall kid walks towards him as the acne kid guards the door. jack doesn't reply.}
<C>__{acne kid}
<D>__{he must be deaf.}
<C>__{tall kid}
<D>__{you deaf jack off?}
<A>__{jack ignores them. irritating the tall kid even more.}
<C>__{tall kid}
<D>__{can't fucking speak either.}
<A>__{he pushes jack against the table, toppling the incubator. panicked, the chicks scatter across the surface. just then the door opens. anna walks in.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{she glances at the older boys then at jack.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nothing miss bryant.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{nothing? the incubator didn't just fall by itself.}
<A>__{the older boys stare at jack. waiting for his reaction.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i tripped. it was an accident.}
<A>__{anna looks at jack carefully. she knows he's lying.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(to the older boys)}
<D>__{show's over. get to your classes.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{jack. help me clear up.}
<A>__{jack doesn't hear her. he's mesmerized by a solitary chick standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i think it's dead.}
<A>__{anna reaches in. tenderly picks up the chick.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. the poor thing's just scared.}
<L>__{interior elementary school. teachers' common room day}
<A>__{school's over. anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books. she can't focus. pulls out a bottle of pills. shakes a pill into her hand. swallows it dry.}
<L>__{interior law office. conference room day}
<A>__{paul works with half a dozen colleagues around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files. he reaches across to a pizza box. it's empty.}

<D>__{who the fuck ordered broccoli?}
<A>__{neal, a thin pallid guy, looks up.}
<C>__{neal}
<D>__{oh that's just disgusting.}
<B>__{preppy guy}
<D>__{what's wrong with vegetarian pizza? it's healthy.}
<C>__{neal}
<D>__{pizza isn't supposed to be healthy.}
<A>__{paul glances at his watch. suddenly realizes the time. he quickly picks up his cell phone. heads for the door.}

<A>__{paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.}
<L>__{interior elementary school. teachers' common room same time}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hi baby. i'm really sorry about this morning. i fucked up. i know.}

<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{promise?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i promise.}
<L>__{interior elementary school. corridor moments later}
<A>__{anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks through the deserted corridor. her high heels echo loudly in the eerie quietness. suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud whumph. anna starts. turns. whumph. the next light dies. anna quickens her step. the lights go off one by one. the darkness quickly creeping up behind her. there's only one light still on as she reaches the exit. she looks up. the light flickers. but then strangely stays on. bathing her in a cold pool of light. anna's unsettled. she turns and frantically pushes the door. it doesn't open. she pushes hard with both hands. nothing. it's locked. she turns back slowly. the darkness around her impenetrable. almost viscous. she reaches out... ... her hand disappears into the thick blackness. anna snatches her hand back. stares at it. then we hear the sound of slow footsteps. moving deliberately towards her.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{her voice echoes down the silent corridor. she glimpses something move in the blackness.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is someone there?}
<A>__{a black shape materializes inside the darkness. silent. brooding. anna can't move. terrified. suddenly the corridor's flooded with a blinding white light. anna's dazzled. shades her eyes with her hand. as she tentatively pulls her hand away... ...it's only jack. his hand on the light switch.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did i scare you miss bryant?}
<A>__{jack moves over to the door.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's locked.}
<A>__{he gently pushes against the door. the door slowly opens.}
<L>__{exterior elementary school moments later}
<A>__{anna, still shaken, walks with jack towards the parking lot.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{shouldn't you be home?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my mom's picking me up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's my birthday. we're going to macdonald's. then on saturday my mom's taking me to busch gardens. we're going to ride the alpengeist.}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{continually voted one of the top ten roller coaster rides in america, the alpengeist is a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(tries to keep a straight face)}
<D>__{i didn't know the park was open yet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my mom's friends with the manager. they're opening it specially for me.}
<A>__{she knows he's lying again. smiles sadly.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sounds like fun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes. it will be fun.}
<A>__{they reach anna's car. stand in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{jack. those boys. do they bother you a lot?}
<A>__{jack hesitates. then slowly nods his head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know you can always talk to me about it if you want to.}
<A>__{he nods. anna's clearly worried about him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you sure you don't need a ride?}
<A>__{jack shakes his head. anna glances at her watch.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well. i better run.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i have to go to a funeral. my old piano teacher.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(with sudden interest)}
<D>__{can i come?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no jack. funerals are very private affairs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've never been to a funeral.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it wouldn't be appropriate jack. anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm sure she would. i will see you tomorrow in class. have a wonderful birthday.}
<A>__{jack nods disappointed. anna watches him walk away then gets in her car.}
<L>__{interior anna's car moments later}
<A>__{anna slips her key into the ignition. loud music suddenly blares from the car radio. she switches it off. squeezes the bridge of her nose. she pulls out a bottle of pills from her bag. it's empty. she rummages in the glove compartment. finds another bottle. empty. she sighs.}
<L>__{exterior elementary school moments later}
<A>__{jack sits on the bench. watches anna drive away. then unzips his backpack. something moves inside. a strange jerky movement. jack closes the backpack. glances up and down the empty street. then walks away on his own.}
<L>__{exterior strip mall. pharmacy day}
<A>__{anna steps out of the pharmacy. as she washes down a pill with a bottle of water she notices a small hair salon. looks critically at herself in the pharmacy window. anna moves over to the salon. reaches for the door handle... then hesitates. she's about to walk away when the salon door suddenly opens. anna smiles shyly as a freshly coiffured woman politely holds the door for her.}
<L>__{interior hair salon day}
<A>__{anna leans back against a washbasin. her neck tightly cradled against the white porcelain. the light's harsh and not particularly flattering. she closes her eyes. behind her the hands of a hairdresser in latex gloves begin to rinse dye from anna's hair.}
<B>__{on sink}
<A>__{startling white. a stream of water flows into the sink. then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red.}
<L>__{interior mother's house. hallway day}
<A>__{anna closes the front door behind her. she smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. her hair a dark vibrant red. just then, from another room, we hear an old woman's hacking cough.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{anna? is that you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes mother.}
<L>__{interior mother's house. bedroom moments later}
<A>__{anna's mother, beatrice (50s), sits in bed, knitting with swift, violent precision. the bedside table's stacked with medication. she's clearly been bed ridden for some time. an electric wheelchair in the corner of the room. anna appears at the door. beatrice scrutinizes her for a second. then returns to her knitting.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{terrible color.}
<A>__{anna moves to the beside table. picks up a dirty plate.}
<C>__{anna}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the doctor said }
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{the doctor's an idiot. he doesn't know what he's talking about.}
<A>__{anna sighs. trying hard not to let her mother provoke her. beatrice glances up. anna avoids her look.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{why did you do it? today of all days.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what have i done wrong this time?}
<A>__{anna goes to the window. draws back the curtains.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you've forgotten haven't you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no i haven't forgotten. the service isn't till six.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{then you've got plenty of time to wash it out.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's permanent. you can't wash it out.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{then dye it back. you can't show up at the funeral looking like that. like some prostitute.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't look }
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{don't argue with me. why are you constantly arguing with me?}
<A>__{anna bites her tongue. heads to the door.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{to do the washing up.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{the sheets need changing. they haven't been changed in months.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i changed them monday.}
<A>__{anna goes to the cupboard. takes out clean sheets.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you weren't here monday. you never sleep at home anymore. what if something happened to me in the middle of the night?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{nothing is going to happen to you. anyway diane }
<C>__{beatrice}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{fat lot of good she is. i wouldn't have to pay for a nurse if my only daughter wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of hers. doing god knows what. they always leave you in the end. you'll see. just like your father }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's enough mother!}
<A>__{anna dumps the sheets on the bed. as she turns to leave beatrice's hand darts out and grabs anna's wrist.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{that's it. go and cry to paul.}

<A>__{anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel driveway. she stops. stares out over the cemetery.}
<C>__{father graham }
<D>__{...certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ, who died and rose again for us.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. viewing room moments later}
<A>__{anna slips into the back of the room. eliot leads mrs. hutton (60s) to the body of her husband, james hutton (70s), lying in the casket. mrs. hutton touches a bouquet of white roses by the casket.}
<C>__{mrs. hutton}
<D>__{white roses. they were his favorite. how did you know?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{they just seemed appropriate somehow.}
<C>__{mrs. hutton}
<D>__{he looks so peaceful. as if he's only sleeping.}
<A>__{anna approaches mrs. hutton. she doesn't notice eliot watching her carefully.}

<D>__{you look tired dear.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. i'm fine. everything's fine.}
<A>__{but we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. mrs. hutton nods, then turns to greet another mourner. anna steps nervously up to the coffin. anna's pov james hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. suddenly his lips part... as he gasps softly.}
<B>__{viewing room}
<A>__{anna steps back terrified. stares at hutton. his face serene again. it must have been her imagination. she glances up quickly. embarrassed. eliot's still observing her. he nods to her cordially.}

<A>__{a spartan room at the top of the house. eliot carefully pins a polaroid of hutton lying in a coffin to the wall. next to hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge of another polaroid. eliot stares intently at hutton's image for a moment, then takes off his jacket and moves to the window. eliot's pov anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. getting increasingly frustrated.}
<L>__{exterior funeral home. driveway day}
<A>__{anna suddenly looses it. angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway. she kneels down. grabs the keys. throws the rest of her things back into the bag. she stands. leans against the car. she looks weary. she glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears. black storm clouds gather on the horizon. anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand. pulls herself together. angry with herself.}

<C>__{anna }
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<A>__{paul dabs the stain with a napkin.}

<D>__{actually there is something i need to talk to you about.}
<A>__{now anna's nervous.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've been offered a transfer to head office in chicago.}
