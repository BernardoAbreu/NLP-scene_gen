<A>__{frode and martin stare at blomkvist's unprofessionally sutured head wound; salander near him like an emaciated bodyguard.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{people hunt on the island, mikael. gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. it could have been a stray shot.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{not from gunner. if he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{we get poachers. they're not always such great shots.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{or he's right, dirch. what if he is? this has to stop.}
<A>__{frode regards blomkvist.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{do you want to stop?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i have police reports, photos, henrik's notes, my own notes, and lisbeth's research. what i don't have are vanger industries records. that's what i want.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{blomkvist doesn't say. only }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{will you authorize it?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i could but why on earth would i?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{because i'm asking.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{the private corporate records.}
<P>__{(blomkvist nods)}
<D>__{how far back?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{all the way.}
<A>__{frode exchanges a look with martin.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{henrik said i have access to everything i need. this is what i need.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{that's not what he meant.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{let's ask him.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{he's not well enough to ask.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{excuse us a moment.}
<A>__{frode and martin step away to confer in private.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i think henrik would say yes.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{that's why he has me. to protect him from himself. this is insane.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what do we have to hide?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{over the course of 120 years of doing business? plenty.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{if he needs this to do his job, he should have permission.}
<A>__{this goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. he can only stare at blomkvist and salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them.}
