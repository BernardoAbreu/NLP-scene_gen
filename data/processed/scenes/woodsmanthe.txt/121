<L>__{exterior interior vicki's apartment night}
<A>__{through the window we see vicki sit down on the couch, and walter sit on the coffee table, facing her. he starts to talk and takes her hand. she pulls it away. he continues to talk and takes her hand again, not letting her pull away. trucks pass by over the wet pavement, rattling the windows.}
