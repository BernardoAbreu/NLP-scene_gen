<L>__{interior a wall street office day}
<A>__{the phone rings. kevin doyle picks it up.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{hello ? eddie ? what are you talking about?}
<A>__{and we cross cut : between them:}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i can't make the meeting, i'm, uh... i'm sick.}
<A>__{it's a lame excuse, it sounds lame as he says it, but then, he's off mdt.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now he'll never give you this chance again!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i need to, ah, analyze this data }
<A>__{we see the two men continue to talk, kevin growing more agitated, eddie growing more sheepish as we hear:}
<D>__{eddie (o.s.) (cont'd) already i recognized it... the thick tongue, the leaden synapses. it was regular eddie the eddie that, now, was unbearable to be.}
<A>__{we fade up the sound : on the two men:}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{... don't you get it?! this is your test !}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, i can't pass a fucking test right now!}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{and how am i going to look if you don't?}
<A>__{eddie looks pretty bad. he massages his temples.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{okay, kevin. okay.}
<A>__{he hands up on a still yammering doyle. he picks up the mdt pill, looks at it.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) it was my first morning off mdt in a month. the beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat, greasy python.}
<A>__{again, he looks at the mdt tablet, weighing his options.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) but the time skips had me scared.}
<A>__{he puts the tablet back down on the table.}
