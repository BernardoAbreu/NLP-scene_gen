<D>__{i am jack's complete lack of surprise.}
<A>__{boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's pretend. you're the department of transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. fuel injectors that burn people alive.}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{just who the fuck do you think you are?! get out! you're fired!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about this? keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. in exchange for my salary, i will keep my mouth shut. i won't need to come to the office. i can do this job from home.}

<C>__{boss}
<D>__{you little fucker! i oughta...}
<A>__{jack punches himself in the nose. blood starts to trickle. he punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by the force of the punch, slams against a framed picture and shatters the glass. he falls to the floor.}

<D>__{i am jack's smirking revenge.}
<A>__{jack gets back to his feet.}
<C>__{jack}

<C>__{jack }
<D>__{under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted, something horrible had been growing.}
<A>__{jack crawls high enough to grab boss's belt, hoisting himself up. he dribbles blood an boss's clothing, smudges blood from his face onto the knuckles of boss's hand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{please... please...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and right then, at our most excellent moment together...}
<A>__{two security guards enter and gape at the sight. behind them stand curious workers, looking in.}
