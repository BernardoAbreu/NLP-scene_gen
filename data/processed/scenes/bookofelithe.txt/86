<A>__{redridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come to a halt outside the theater. redridge emerges from his car, carrying the bible. walks up to the palladium and enters.}
<L>__{interior alcatraz cell block day}
<A>__{what was once a cell block is now an immense library. stacked floor to ceiling with books. lombardi shows eli and solara around. behind them, a pair of armed guards follow closely.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{yes, we've been doing this for some time now. collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all across the nation. we even have a printing press that we hope to have operational soon.}
<A>__{solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books. she's never seen anything like it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you turned the whole prison into a library?}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{well, not exactly. we're more like a storage facility. we're holding these books here in trust, if you like. when society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve these volumes, they'll be here waiting.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i must ask you, how did you hear about us? we've been doing everything we can to get the word out, but we always like to know where our benefactors come from.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i was sent here by god.}
<A>__{lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{is that right? well, it's good to know we're getting such high profile referrals these days.}

<D>__{i must say, i am so excited that we finally have a king james. you know, we have a talmud here, we have two korans, we even have that scientology book. but never a christian bible, until now. i honestly believed it was the one book i'd never see again, after what happened...}
<A>__{beat. lombardi appears sad for a moment.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{may i ask what condition it's in?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's a little beat up. but it'll do the job.}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{well, then. what say we take a look at it?}
<A>__{lombardi looks at eli with anticipation. so does solara, interested to know where this is going to go nexterior eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{is there someplace we could sit?}
<C>__{lombardi}
<D>__{of course. right this way.}
