<L>__{interior "heaven" headquarters day}
<A>__{ted, charlie, helen, and uncle billy walk past graphic designers in cubicles as helen leads a tour of the "heaven" magazine offices. as they pass each cubicle, heads pop up to check them out. "heaven" war room polaroids of naked women cover every square inch of wall space. ted and charlie gawk. who can blame them?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month. it's your job, ted, to decide which of them is right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let me get this straight...}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{if it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{these are real, live women?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<P>__{(winking at ted)}
<D>__{we don't generally feature blow up dolls in our magazine. but hey, if you think there's a market for it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{god, i love being dead.}
<A>__{ted focuses on one particular picture. he removes the push pin that holds it to the wall.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i like her.}
<A>__{we can see the concerned look on helen's face. does this kid have any taste at all?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{nice choice. there's only one problem.}
<A>__{she shows uncle billy.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you think she upgraded?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they went in through the belly button.}
<A>__{uncle billy nods. he explains gently...}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{we don't allow tipn, ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tipping?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{tipn. tattoos, implants, piercings, nose jobs. our angels must be pure, unadultered, completely natural.}
<A>__{ted looks at the walls again. carefully. he has a knack for this. he hands a picture to helen. she turns to uncle billy and smiles.}
<C>__{helen }
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{you have your father's eye.}
<A>__{his father. he just can't get used to that. who was this guy?}
