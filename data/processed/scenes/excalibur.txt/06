<L>__{interior passageway outside chapel, tintagel castle dawn}
<A>__{igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the chant, calling the castle to worship. she rushes to her husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering. the duke of cornwall looks back at uther, hatred in his eyes.}
<L>__{exterior war camp before tintagel castle day}
<A>__{uther is in a towering rage. sword drawn, he stalks among the biers of fallen knights. squires and clerics keep a healthy distance. the sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling thunder. beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out of the sea stands the impregnable tintagel castle, seat of the duke of cornwall, now under siege.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(bellowing in all directions)}
<D>__{merlin! where are you!?}
<A>__{just then a knight rides up and dismounts. it is ulfius, a lieutenant.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{have you found him?}
<C>__{ulfius}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{but he cannot finish. he is taken aback by the sudden appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a beggar's pan.}
<C>__{hag}
<D>__{what a hurry you were in this morning, good sir. you forgot to give this old woman a coin.}
<C>__{ulfius}
<D>__{i saw you half a day's gallop from here. i asked you if you had seen merlin. i returned here straight away. how did }
<C>__{hag}
<D>__{ i heard. i have come. i am also merlin.}
<A>__{the figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, andoit is merlin, laughing.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i have walked my way since the beginning of time. sometimes i give, sometimes i take. it is mine to know which, and when.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{dumb riddles, merlin. i am your king.}
<A>__{ulfius edges away.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i know the storm inside you, and what it has wrought. the alliance i forged is wrecked.}
<A>__{the duke of cornwall under siege. all this for lust. selfish lust. uther grabs merlin.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{for igrayne. one night with her. do it. use the magic.}
<A>__{merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at uther.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you will swear by your true kingship to grant me what i wish. then you shall have it.}
<A>__{uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, a cross.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i swear it. by excalibur and the holy }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{ what issues from your lust will be mine. swear it again.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i swear it.}
<A>__{merlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling king.}
