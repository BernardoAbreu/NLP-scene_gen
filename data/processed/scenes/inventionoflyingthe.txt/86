<D>__{nothing's really changed. i gave people the man in the sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it. everyone's happy but me. because i'm the only one who knows it all... isn't. i made it all up.}

<D>__{you're not up there living in a mansion. you're right here. in the ground. that's all. and i'm the only one who knows that.}

<D>__{and the one thing i want i can't have. because the world is too stupid to change. the world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what... makes sense. no one listens to what they really want. and that's why i will always just be a loser, grandma. and that's why i will always be alone.}
