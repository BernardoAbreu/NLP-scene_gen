<L>__{interior sophomore english class day}
<A>__{bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in big flowing handwriting.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{i realize the language of mr. shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but i'm sure you're all doing your best.}
<A>__{bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to chastity. chastity opens the note and reads: insert "joey dorsey said hi to me in the hall! oh! my god!" chastity frowns to herself.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{ms. stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far?}
<A>__{bianca looks up and smiles the smile of daddy's little girl.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{the teacher shakes her head, but lets it go. mandella. a waif like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand.}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{mandella since you're assisting us, you might as well comment. i'm assuming you read the assignment.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{uh, yeah, i read it all}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{the whole play^}
<C>__{mandelia}
<D>__{the whole folio. all the plays.}
<C>__{teacher}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{you've read every play by william shakespeare?}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{haven't you?}
<A>__{she raises a challenging eyebrow. the stunned teacher doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.}
