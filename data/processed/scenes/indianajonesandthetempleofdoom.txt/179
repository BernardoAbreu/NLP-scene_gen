<A>__{on the altar, under the statue of kali, willie and short round are helping indy and some of the bigger children rip down a long wooden panel decorated with hideous kali figures. the childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple. the swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the edge of the fire pit. indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd toward the chasm. they stand it up and when indy gives thw word they drop it the panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which the children now begin running to safety.}
