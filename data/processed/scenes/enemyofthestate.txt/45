<A>__{close on another analyst facing three monitors showing additional views of zavitz's escape as captured by a traffic camera, an atm camera and the security inside harrison's.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{we've checked everything. nro tapes, traffic surveillance monitors }
<L>__{interior image enhancement lab}
<A>__{two techies huddle by a monitor overseen by fiedler, a computer expert. the monitor displays the harrison's surveillance tape of the zavitz dean meeting.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{ and two atm cameras. the one showing promise, though, is this security camera from the department store.}
<P>__{(to techie)}
<D>__{freeze there.}
<A>__{the techie hits a command. zavitz and dean freeze on screen.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{times ten.}
<A>__{the techie boxes the area to be enhanced. he types commands. the boxed area increases ten fold.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{focus on the drop.}
<A>__{the enlarged view shifts to dean's gift bags. the picture's fuzzy. someone passes by, blocking the view at a crucial moment.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{enhance, then forward, frame by frame...}
<A>__{more keystrokes. the computer takes over, clarifying the image with passes of resolution. hicks leans in closer as the image of the bag inches forward.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{just before the view's blocked, zavitz reaches in his jacket for something. when the view returns, there's a shape change in dean's bag. see the shadow variance? we reverse imaged it }
<A>__{fiedler points to another screen displaying a digitally enhanced image of the shadowed object and its approximate shape.}
<C>__{fiedler }
<D>__{something's definitely been added. it's not a video cassette, the shadow's wrong.}
<A>__{reynolds steps forward. his eyes are red. it's been a long night.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{what's your opinion?}
<C>__{fiedler}
<D>__{it's hard to say for certain, these things are }
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to say for certain. this is what you're trained to do, right?}
<C>__{fiedler}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{then what's your goddam opinion?}
<C>__{fiedler}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{zavitz had digital compression equipment. he could've downloaded into something. a disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<P>__{(to hicks)}
<D>__{get it.}
<A>__{reynolds heads for the door.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{we'd have to }
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{get it.}
