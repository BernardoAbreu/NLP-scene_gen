<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{ext house night, sky clear}
<A>__{the vw is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in coraline's bedroom window switches on. we hear charlie make a strangled sound.}
<L>__{interior coraline's bedroom night full moon rising}
<A>__{coraline sits in bed pajamas washed and patched, wounds dressed, hair shining. the key hangs from a string around her neck. a gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky. charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed toy squid like it's an alien face hugger then, feigning death, falls on the bed. coraline laughs.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{so, gonna order the tulips?}
<A>__{he opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{for the garden party!!}
<A>__{he sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the squid.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{she turns to mom, arranging things on a shelf.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{so, mom. invitations? don't forget the invitations.}
<A>__{her mother nods, points up.}
<C>__{mel}
<D>__{even bobinsky?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{mr. b's not drunk, mom, he's just...eccentric.}
<A>__{charlie laughs. he bends down to kiss her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{good night, coraline.}
<A>__{as he steps away, mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter. she gives coraline a "told you so" look, and she and charlie leave the room. coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box it's the green and orange gloves she'd wanted! she pulls one on to admire when the black cat appears outside her window}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{oh, hello again.}
<A>__{she walks over to the window, opens it.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{you still mad?}
<A>__{his expression says yes, he's still mad.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{i'm really sorry i threw you at her the other mother? it was all i could think of.}
<A>__{the cat's angry expression softens. he rests his head on her hand, licking her fingers and purrs. coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed. she grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large pearl, the circus ball, and the grey stickshift knob. she holds them out to the cat.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{i think it's time, don't you? to set them free?}
<A>__{the cat nods. she puts the ghost eyes under her pillow and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. the two of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they doze off to sleep. we slowly tilt up.}
