<D>__{what can i say? time's a thief. one day you're rich as an arab, the next you're lucky if you can afford a god damn can of pistachio nuts.}
<A>__{wills wanders over to the mantel where family photos sit in tarnished antique silver frames. he picks up a photograph of a young girl in tennis whites it's charlotte's mother, katie. wills' face is suffused with tenderness as he studies it. dolores walks over and looks }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{how about that, huh? that was the summer you two }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{who'd have guessed what time had in store for her, huh? look at that smile.}
<A>__{eyes moistening, dolores crosses to her armchair. her tone is slightly bitter }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{then again, time loves some people. like you, for instance. oh, time's just wild about you.}
<A>__{she plops down unsteadily and reaches for her cigarettes }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{just as handsome and charming as ever. and still up to the same old tricks.}
<A>__{wills sets the photo back on the mantel }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{first time you came to pick up katie, you brought me flowers. just like those.}

<D>__{dolly, look }
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{aw, why the hell don't you leave her alone? christ, she's sick!}
<A>__{but before wills can answer, they hear footsteps on the stairs. neither moves. charlotte enters, wearing a peasant dress and felt hat, looking pretty, pale, and excited. wills and dolores slowly turn. they smile at her, then exchange a quick glance. charlotte catches it and becomes self conscious }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what? what's wrong?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{you look like your mom is all.}
<A>__{charlotte looks to wills to see if that's, indeed, what he was thinking. he nods his agreement. she is pleased.}
