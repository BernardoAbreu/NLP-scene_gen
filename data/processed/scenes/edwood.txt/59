<L>__{interior editing room day}
<A>__{on a moviola, we see the black and white image of dolores taking off her angora and giving it to ed. we pull out. ed and georgie are hunched over, watching the movie. ed smiles proudly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and we fade out. "the end."}
<P>__{(the film runs out)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{georgie peers at his watch. he shakes his bead.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{i think it's fifty seven minutes long.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah? whatever. so did you like it?}
<C>__{georgie}
<P>__{(like a lecturing teacher)}
<D>__{ed, what was the one thing i asked you to do? make it seven reels long . i've got contracts with my exhibitors. if it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{gee, i used every frame of film we shot. maybe they won't notice.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{they'll notice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, why don't you let me take over from here? i can do a few tricks: pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{um, i guess }
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{good. and one more thing. i think your "written, directed, and starring ed wood" credit is a bad idea.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{why?! i did all those things! hell, i even built the props.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{and you did a bang up job, too. but you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag. trust me. it's a career killer.}
<A>__{ed is quite upset.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but i'm proud. i wrote, directed, and starred in it just like orson welles in "citizen kane"!}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{yeah?? well orson welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!}
<A>__{ed is beaten.}
