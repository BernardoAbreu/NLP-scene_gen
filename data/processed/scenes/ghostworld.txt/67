<L>__{interior art class day}
<A>__{a toothy, zit covered 14 year old boy poses with a very poorly made sculpture. a flash goes off and he jumps slightly, sending pieces of his sculpture flying. it's roberta, taking photos. she moves on to enid, in front of her big painting.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{smile, enid...}
<A>__{enid ad libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off. roberta now turns to address the class.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i'm going to miss you people... i feel that we've all done a lot of growing this summer. i hope that each of you feels as though you'll be taking away something from this experience; i know i certainly will be...}
<A>__{a long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{remember, the art show is this saturday at seven thirty sharp. try to get there at least 15 minutes early.}
<A>__{the students get their things together and file out.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{enid, can i talk to you for a minute?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{don't worry it's nothing bad. i was just wondering what your plans were for next year?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm not really sure working, i guess...}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, i know this is really short notice, but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art & design and she tells me that i'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, i hope you don't mind, enid, but i took the liberty of submitting your name.}
<A>__{she gives her a booklet and an application form.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{...wow...}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so what do you think?}
<C>__{enid}
