<L>__{interior sean's office night}
<A>__{will sits across from sean.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{so you might be working for uncle sam.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{gerry says the meeting went well.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what did you think?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what did i think?}
<A>__{a beat. will has obviously been stewing on this.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{say i'm working at n.s.a. somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. so i take a shot at it and maybe i break it. and i'm real happy with myself, 'cause i did my job well. but maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in north africa or the middle east. once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people i never had a problem with get killed.}
<P>__{(rapid fire) now the politicians are}
<D>__{sayin' "send in the marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit. it won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the national guard. it'll be some guy from southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. and he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. meanwhile my buddy from southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. and of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. a cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two fifty a gallon. and naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea life in the north atlantic. so my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. and meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special they're servin' is north atlantic scrod with quaker state.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{so what'd i think? i'm holdin' out for somethin' better. i figure i will eliminate the middle man. why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the national guard? christ, i could be elected president.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{do you think you're alone?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{do you have a soul mate?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{define that.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{someone who challenges you in every way. who takes you places, opens things up for you. a soul mate.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{sean waits.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{shakespeare, neitzche, frost, o'connor, chaucer, pope, kant }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{they're all dead.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{not to me, they're not.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{but you can't give back to them, will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{that's what i'm saying, will. you'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, what? you're going to take the professor's side on this?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{don't give me your line of shit.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i didn't want the job.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{it's not about that job. i'm not saying you should work for the government. but, you could do anything you want. and there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. what do you want to do?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i didn't ask for this.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{nobody gets what they ask for, will. that's a cop out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why is it a cop out? i don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home i'm buildin'. or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. there's honor in that.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you're right, will. any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.}
<A>__{a beat. will says nothing.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{and when they get drunk and puke in the sink, they don't have to see it the next morning because of you. that's real work, will. and there is honor in that. which i'm sure is why you took the job.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night, writing on chalkboards and lying about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{'cause there's no honor in that.}
<A>__{will is silent.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{something you want to say?}
<A>__{sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why don't you come back when you have an answer for me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{if you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{will loses it, slams the door shut.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{sean has finally gotten to will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{who the fuck are you to lecture me about life? you fuckin' burnout! where's your "soul mate?!"}
<A>__{sean lets this play out. possible "shepard" change.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dead! she dies and you just cash in your chips. that's a fuckin' cop out!}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i been there. i played my hand.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's right. and you fuckin' lost! and some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{look at me. what do you want to do?}
<A>__{a beat. will looks up.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you and your bullshit. you got an answer for everybody. but i asked you a straight question and you can't give me a straight answer. because you don't know.}
<A>__{sean goes to the door and opens it. will walks out.}
