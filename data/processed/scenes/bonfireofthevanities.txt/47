<L>__{exterior beach house porch day}
<A>__{sherman and judy are having drinks with sherman's father and mother. over the following, campbell is tugging at judy's sleeve, asking repeatedly, "but what does he do? what does daddy do?!" to which, judy replies, "he sells bonds." sherman is, at the same time, searching through a newspaper for any news of the accident.}
<P>__{mrs. mccoy (mother)}
<D>__{... and she said to me, 'i like my older customers best of all. they're the only ones who drink anymore.'}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<D>__{mrs. mccoy 'my older customers!'}
<P>__{mr. mccoy (father)}
<D>__{she thought you were twenty five.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{all of a sudden i'm married to a white ribbon.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{sherman, what are you looking for in that newspaper?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{nothing. i... uh... no, nothing special.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{but what's a bond? mrs. mccoy}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{oh, yes, sherman, do explain it. mr. mccoy yes. your mother and i really want to hear this, sherman.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{a bond is a way of lending people money. let's say you want to build a road or a hospital and you need a lot of money. well, you issue a bond...}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{do you build roads?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{no, i don't actually build them... mr. mccoy i think you're in over your head.}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{here. let me try. darling, daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{that's what he said. bonds.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes. see, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. and you're allowed to keep those crumbs.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{crumbs? really... mr. mccoy}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{and many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(enjoying this)}
<D>__{yes. and that's what daddy does. he passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. but you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. and a great golden cake. and a lot of golden crumbs. and you have to imagine daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. that's what daddy does.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{well, you can call them crumbs if you want to...}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's the best i can do. excuse me.}
<A>__{she gets up abruptly and leaves. mrs. mccoy goes after judy. sherman and his father sit there without talking. then...}
<D>__{mr. mccoy of course, in my day, there was some integrity to it...}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{yes. well... mr. mccoy now it's not about anything, is it? except the money.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{i don't make the rules. mr. mccoy all the more reason not to play the game.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{we're having a little... it's nothing serious. really.}
