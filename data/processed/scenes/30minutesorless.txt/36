<L>__{exterior junior high school day}
<A>__{the guys get to will's car. chet wraps up a call on his cell }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{...thanks so much, mrs. davis. i will call you after i talk to the doctor.}
<A>__{chet hangs up. he is standing by the passenger door. he looks over the roof of the car at will.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{so, this is it?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is what?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{once i step inside this car, i'm basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. and if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. they'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. it'll be all over the news. next thing you now, some militia or islam group is claiming us as members. my family will be humiliated.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we'll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won't really matter.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{exactly!}
<A>__{will sighs.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i get it. take your time, man.}
<A>__{will gets in the car and shuts the door. he looks out at chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{this is the world's biggest favor, you motherfucker. you didn't even help me move last winter.}
<A>__{chet reluctantly hops in.}
