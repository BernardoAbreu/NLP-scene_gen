<DIAL>__{EXT. FIELD - DAY We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of children's laughter. Excited shrieking. A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE, and sister, ANNE, (10). Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head skimming along the sheaves. REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat)}
<DIAL>__{From the Carey family. SIR THOMAS indicates to ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired. Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.}
<CHAR>__{LADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But that's wonderful.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I turned it down. LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And offered them Mary instead. SIR THOMAS indicates MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired. Pretty. Sweet-natured.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son.}
<CHAR>__{LADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You underestimate Mary.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer. The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart. On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished. SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(applauding his favourite)}
<DIAL>__{Bravo! Anne! EXT. BELL TOWER - TEN YEARS LATER Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church. INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{May we come in..? ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat)}
<DIAL>__{I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.'}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hardly.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity? GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An intimate moment.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all..}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat)}
<DIAL>__{Apart from that - it won't change a thing. The three of them hug together, tightly.. INT. CHAPEL - DAY A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air is thick with incense. And winter cold.. The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER, MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and finally ANNE..}
<CHAR>__{PRIEST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis.. The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(35), puts it on MARY's finger.}
<DIAL>__{few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices. INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and}
<DIAL>__{other GUESTS..}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you happy?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Very.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then you've found the right man.}
<TRANS>__{IN ANOTHER CORNER:}
<DIAL>__{ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who is that? He was staring at me in church?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England. ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"}
<CHAR>__{GEORGE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed. GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar. ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.}
<TRANS>__{IN ANOTHER CORNER:}
<DIAL>__{he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and close personal friend of the KING's walks with his growling DOGS to where SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and LADY ELIZABETH are sitting. SIR THOMAS gets to his feet..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thomas.. he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY ELIZABETH), and kisses her..}
<CHAR>__{NORFOLK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late summer.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much..}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he turns to ELIZABETH)}
<DIAL>__{Did you hear that, Elizabeth?}
<CHAR>__{LADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(hates the idea)}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court. LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..}
<CHAR>__{NORFOLK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{a beat)}
<DIAL>__{It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage.}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What? And make a bastard King of England?}
<CHAR>__{NORFOLK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat)}
<DIAL>__{Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same? NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about Anne? SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's dancing with GEORGE...}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter..}
<CHAR>__{NORFOLK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not. SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She's anything but. INT. BOLEYN CASTLE - DAY SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..}
<CHAR>__{ADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{LA king doesn't like her? Or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl?}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once? An ominous clap of thunder outside..}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Risk nothing, you gain nothing. ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..}
<CHAR>__{LADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life.}
<CHAR>__{LADY ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up. LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside. INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits. Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You asked to see me father?}
<CHAR>__{SIR THOMAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. Come in. SIR THOMAS closes the door. INT. HEVER CASTLE - NIGHT MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too.}

<DIAL>__{What? What are you saying..?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine...if he were to like me?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{a beat)}
<DIAL>__{Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But what about your happiness? Your future? ANNE shrugs, smiles..}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I could be a happy Duchess. INT. BEDROOOM - NIGHT MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you nervous?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A little.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No details spared? The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.}
<ACTION>__{The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes. MARY stares at her husband.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold me a moment?}
<ACTION>__{WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..}
<CHAR>__{MARY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}

<ACTION>__{WILLIAM reaches for the wine..}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Drink?}
<ACTION>__{MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{You should. It will hurt less.}
<ACTION>__{MARY nervously drinks..}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Lie back.}
<ACTION>__{MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls down his trousers. MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly lowers himself on top of her. He enters her. MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one might not have imagined. But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Thank you. WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused. aybe this is how it's meant to be.}
<TRANS>__{FADE TO BLACK:}
<DIAL>__{EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust. The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake. The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS, who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS.. It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not, This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end. Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome, in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough, intimidating lot. Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books.. Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS. Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance, etc. Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting. And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS, and a second STANDARD BEARER.. EXT. HEVER - DAY The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance.. Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching. His expression changes... EXT. HEVER - ESTATE - DAY Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as STAFFORD calls out, "The King!" INT. HEVER - DAY ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS.

HEVER - DAY The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens). MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside her.
