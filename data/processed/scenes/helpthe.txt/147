<A>__{three dozen servers stand in a line. minny and aibileen are among them. tables are covered with items donated for the auction. on the baked goods table, minny's famed chocolate pie promises to again be a big money maker. celia and johnny enter the ballroom. celia wears a hideous, pink and silver sequined gown. as usual, celia's breasts command attention. the room locks on celia as specks of light bounce off her dress and jiggle across the ceiling. a titillated old husband tips his martini onto his wife's shoe.}
