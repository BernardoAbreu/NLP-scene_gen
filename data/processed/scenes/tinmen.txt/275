<C>__{nora}
<D>__{get the toast yourself.}

<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i'm just trying to be honest. it's been on my mind... on my conscience.}
<A>__{he picks up a plate.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{this plate yours or mine?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{why don't you take both... maybe you can choke to death on one of them.}
<A>__{bb takes one of the plates and goes toward the table. nora watches him a beat, amazed that he doesn't seem to recognize the seriousness of the situation.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{how can you be so... how can you not understand how wrong that is? i can't understand that mentality! shoot pool for me! it's insane.}
<A>__{bb dips his toast into his eggs.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{tilley is not the most rational man in this world. i tried to talk to him... he wouldn't listen. so, what are my options? you know what i'm saying? what are my options?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i can't believe you had to shoot pool! don't you understand that ... don't you understand how crazy that is? you're sitting there... you're eating your eggs as if it's normal business in life here! like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{all right, i'm sorry.}

<C>__{bb}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{it means i'm supposed to give you up, and i'm never supposed to see you again.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{will you stop eating the eggs for a minute! how can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs?! what does this mean, bill?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{well, i'm supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement, but i'm not that honorable a guy.}
<A>__{he smiles, takes a quick sip of his coffee.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{why are you running off so fast here?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i told you, i got some business downtown.}
