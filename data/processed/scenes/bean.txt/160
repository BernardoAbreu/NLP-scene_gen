<L>__{interior police precinct. interview room night}
<A>__{classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed venetian blinds. two or three detectives slouched in the shadows. brutus, the huge black detective from earlier, sits opposite bean at a table, smoking. he is looking at a photo. a close up reveals it to be a full length one of bean and the robber outside the mall with the robber's face unmasked. brutus eyes bean for a while. bean is terrified. brutus taps the photo.}

<D>__{it's eddie guardino. go pick him up.}
<A>__{one of the detectives lazily leaves the room. brutus leans forward on his elbows.}
<C>__{brutus}
<D>__{guardino fled the scene with 160 k, in a white plastic bag. we got the car. we got the bag. and we got 20 pairs of stinking pantyhose. (drags on his cigarette) anything you wanna tell me?}
<A>__{bean looks at h4 m blankly. brutus holds up the photo.}
<C>__{brutus}
<D>__{'fraid i'm gonna have to keep this.}
<A>__{bean calmly takes the picture and tears it in half. he gives back the robber half and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket. brutus glares at him.}
