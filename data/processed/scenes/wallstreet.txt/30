<L>__{interior bud's apartment night}
<A>__{bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. he's not expecting a visitor. when he opens the door he is knocked for a loop. a smashing looking lady in a fitted chanel suit, ropes of chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing there. taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.}

<D>__{hello bud, i'm lisa, a friend of gordon's.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(in a daze)}
<D>__{lisa. gordon? oh, mr. gekko. sure. would you, uh, like to come in?}
