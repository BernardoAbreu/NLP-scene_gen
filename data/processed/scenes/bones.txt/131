<L>__{exterior black cat pool club night}
<A>__{stank and weaze with eddie mack, who's getting a manicure from a coke whore.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{you boys been hitting the pipe?}
<C>__{weaze}
<D>__{no, eddie. it's just that, i dunno. he was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. all i remember is the voice. it was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{then how'd you hear it, fool?}
<C>__{weaze}
<D>__{it was just like in my head.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{maybe i oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. you'll feel better, i promise.}
<C>__{stank}
<D>__{no, eddie, man. wait.}
<A>__{but he's not about to shoot him. he leans over and snorts a line of white powder off the mirrored tray.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{i told you not to lie to me. now what the hell happened?}
<C>__{coke whore}
<P>__{(needs a hit)}
<D>__{what about me, baby?}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{shutup, bitch. now what, he just said to tell you what? he was back? who was back?}
<C>__{stank}
<D>__{bones.}
<A>__{at the very sound of the name, mack freezes. then with sudden coke fueled ferocity, he whips around and starts smacking the shit out of stank, breaking his nose. the coke whore cheering eddie on. wanting to see more action.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{bones? what the fuck is that supposed to mean? get the fuck out of here. both of you, 'fore you hear my voice up in yo' head.}
