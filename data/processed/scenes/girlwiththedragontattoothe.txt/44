<D>__{she couldn't have fallen and drowned?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{the currents aren't strong here. anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. like her father. his body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before.}
<A>__{vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{no. someone killed her, mr. blomkvist. someone on the island that day. someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday.}
<A>__{he unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{these were from her.}
<A>__{and, on another wall, forty similarly framed flowers }
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{these, from her killer.}
<A>__{blomkvist regards the forty ...}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{who knows about these?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{me, the police, the murderer ... and now you.}
