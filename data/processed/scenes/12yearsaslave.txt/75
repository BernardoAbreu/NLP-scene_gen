<L>__{exterior weaving house morning}
<A>__{it is day break. as ordered, solomon is up and working. chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for solomon.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{if tibeats prefers a different size, i will endeavor to furnish them, but you may use those until further directed.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<L>__{exterior weaving house later}
<A>__{as the day gets on to mid morning, the sun already baking in the sky, tibeats makes his way over to solomon. even before arriving to solomon his mien is one of belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{i thought i told yah ta commence ta puttin' on clapboards this morn'.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{yes, master. i am about it. i have begun on the other side of the house.}
<A>__{tibeats walks around to look over solomon's work. he is picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{didn't i tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of chapin?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{and so i did; and chapin said he would get another size for you, if you wanted them when he came back from the field.}
<A>__{tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. moving toward solomon "with a great passion:"}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{goddamn yah! i thought yah knowed somethin'!}
<A>__{solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with eliza, is in no mood for tibeats.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i did as instructed. if there's something wrong, then its wrong with your instructions.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{yah black bastard! yah goddman black bastard!}
<A>__{in an inconsolable rage, tibeats runs off to the piazza to fetch a whip. solomon looks around. he is alone other than rachel and mistress ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses, runs out to the field to fetch chapin. solomon's instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as tibeats marches back whip in hand.}
<C>__{tibeats }
<D>__{strip yer clothes!}
<A>__{solomon does no such thing.}
<C>__{tibeats }
<D>__{strip!}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i will not.}
<A>__{with "concentrated vengeance," tibeats springs for solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand an raising the whip with the other. before he can strike the blow, however, solomon catches tibeats by the collar of his coat and pulls him in close. reaching down, solomon grabs tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back with the other hand. tibeats tumbles to the ground. a violent struggle takes place as solomon puts a foot to tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches the whip from tibeats and begins to strike him with the handle again and again and again.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{yew will not live ta see another day, nigger! this is yer last, i swear it!}
<A>__{solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat tibeats. blow after blow falling fast and heavy on tibeats's wriggling form. the stiff stock of the whip wraps around tibeats's cringing body until solomon's arm aches. tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and then pleas for mercy:}
<C>__{tibeats }
<D>__{murder! it's murder! lord, god, help me. god be merciful!}
<A>__{and then suddenly, tibeats shrieks }
<P>__{tibeats (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{papa i'm sorry!}
<A>__{chapin comes riding in from the field fast and hard. solomon strikes tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers a well directed kick that sends tibeats rolling over the ground.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{what is the matter?}
<A>__{tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on solomon:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{master tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{what's the matter with the nails?}
<A>__{with a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, tibeats says, as if being exposed }
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{they're...they're too large.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{i am overseer here. i told platt to use them, and}
<P>__{(more}
<C>__{chapin }
<D>__{i shall furnish such nails as i please. do you understand that, mr. tibeats?}
<A>__{tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{this ain't done by half. i will have flesh, and i will have all of it.}
<A>__{tibeats moves off toward, and then into the house. chapin follows. a long moment, solomon stands alone. he looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee. anxiety mounts on his features. a moment more, and tibeats exits the house. he saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil. or, worse, to fetch him. chapin comes running back out of the house. he is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest. though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{do not stir. do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever. but if you run there is no protecting you.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{sir }
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{if you run, platt, there is no protecting you. rachel...!}
<A>__{chapin runs off to join rachel. the two converse at a distance from solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen. solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come. and we wait with him. and we wait, and we continue to wait... moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts. solomon's eyes begin to well. he has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him.}
<B>__{a slight prayer to the heavens begins to form in his}
<A>__{throat, but he is too choked up to fully speak it. chapin has now returned to the piazza. he stands and watches, but does not move to solomon. solomon waits, and waits... we hear the sound of distant hoofs which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder. it's tibeats. he returns with two accomplices; ramsay and cook. they carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{tha's the one. tha's him.}
<A>__{dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by tibeats his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner. in the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly. solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree. a lynching is in store. the naked horror of it intensely palpable. solomon looks toward the piazza, but chapin is now gone. tears of fear flow down solomon's cheeks. he is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight. a rope goes around solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree. the trio begin to hoist solomon. he gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him. with suddenness, chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand colt paterson .36 caliber "holster" pistols with 9" barrels. chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob. he is sharp and matter of fact. with the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{gentlemen... whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man. i am overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of william ford, my duty is to protect his interests. ford holds a mortgage on platt of four hundred dollars. if you hang him, he loses his debt. until that is canceled you have no claim to his life.}
<A>__{directing his attention to ramsay and cook:}
<C>__{chapin }
<D>__{as for you two, if you have any regard for your own safety...i say, begone!}
<A>__{ramsay and cook don't need to be told twice. the pistols chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. without further word, they mount their horses and ride away. tibeats remains, and his anger with him.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{yah got no cause. platt is mine, and mine ta do with as i please. yah touch my property, i will 'ave yah strung up as well.}
<A>__{tibeats mounts up and departs. there is a surreal moment as chapin's not sure what to do about solomon. he chooses to do nothing. solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as chapin calls to sam in the distance:}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{sam! get the mule. you must ride to master ford. tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay. tell him they are trying to murder platt. hurry, boy. bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, suh!}
<A>__{sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed.}
