<L>__{interior house late afternoon}
<A>__{walter vale, sixty two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished colonial house. he is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes. after a few moments an old car pulls up. a slightly overweight woman gets out of the car. she starts to walk up to the house. walter steps back from the window and waits. the doorbell rings. walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. and then he goes to the door and opens it.}
