<B>__{close on schematic map}
<A>__{it shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel. it is now almost to the vault. a violin bow enters to tap at the line.}
<C>__{dorr }
<D>__{despite our little setback we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault...}
<A>__{the bow taps at the vault outline.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...here, this afternoon, having successfully blasted that little ol' rock to pieces during miz munson's choir practice.}
<A>__{the violin bow withdraws.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...clark, perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin'.}
<A>__{a bandaged hand enters frame and a finger stump points at the end of the penciled line.}
<C>__{pancake }
<D>__{of course. why, it's child's play now, easiest thing in the world. only a couple of feet separate us from the vault...}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{the men are clustered around the map, spread out on the sackbutt case in the cellar. clark continues:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{oh, i should think so, it's only one finger. inhibits me in doing finer work, of course. i will always have to live with that... ahem. maybe, and i'm just thinking out loud here, maybe since, as you say, it will present problems later...}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes, clark?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, maybe and this is something i've talked over with mountain girl, and she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion maybe i should get a little extra compensation for the accident.}
<A>__{a long, stony silence.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...somewhat larger share. why, if this were any other line of work i'd be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't i? might even have a pretty good lawsuit.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{you gonna sue yaself for blowin' off your finger?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well that is simply asinine }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes but you see, clark, this is not what you just called "some other line of work."}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{but if it were }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{this is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor. governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{yeah, but he lost his finger.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{we don't give a shit! man can blow his own dick off, don't make no nevermind to us! we don't gotta pay the man for goin' around blowin' off body parts! getcha head outcha ass, man!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{look, you }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i think that in this instance gawain has a very excellent pointerior i }
<C>__{general}
<D>__{no extra share!}
<A>__{all stop and stare at the general. clark grumbles:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, okay, majority rules, like i say, it was just a trial balloon. hand's not so bad really, i even get some phantom feeling.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{you pull on your prick you get phantom feeling. greedy motherfuck.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{now that that matter is settled, let us synchronize our watches before gawain reports to work. in... twenty seconds... it will be twelve sixteen exactly... fifteen...}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{it will be twelve fifteen?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{no, in fifteen seconds now eleven seconds it will be twelve sixteen... eight...}
