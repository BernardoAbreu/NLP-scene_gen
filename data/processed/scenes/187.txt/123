<L>__{interior trevor's bedroom later that night}
<A>__{... the digital clock next to trevor's bed reads:}
<L>__{2:14 a.m.}
<A>__{trevor sleeps. hold for a portentous moment. now the stillness is broken by a clatter at the front door. someone enters the house. trevor awakens. jolts out of bed. disoriented a beat.}
<L>__{interior trevor's hallway}
<A>__{in boxer shorts and a t shirt, adjusting his glasses, trevor ventures through darkness...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... who's there?}
<A>__{a light flickers on in the living room.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{you should keep your door locked.}
<A>__{adjusting the angle now as the living room comes into}
<B>__{view...}
<A>__{ellen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(still half asleep)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{ellen ignores his question.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(impaling him with a look)}
<D>__{i just want you to tell me one thing...}
<A>__{now something she sees stops her pacing... ... the black rosary beads on the dinner table.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(off ellen's puzzled look)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{following her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads. as he places them in a drawer in the credenza.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{ellen's confused. lost in a fixated gaze.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{... if you had any idea what i've been thinking lately... you'd think i was crazy.}
<P>__{(running it through her mind)}
<D>__{... remember that john doe they found in the l.a. river. turned out it was benny.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(impacted)}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{... benny's mother identified the body.}
<A>__{trevor just looks at her, a bated pause. now he blinks.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{benny was no saint, ellen. this is a kid who terrorized hald the school. he even broke into your house. maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears.}
<A>__{ellen just looks at him.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... maybe he's better off.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{that's a horrible thing to say.}
<A>__{trevor accepts that it is.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{do you believe for every troubled kid like benny there's one or two others just waiting to take his place? like cesar... or his friend stevie.}
<A>__{an awkward moment of silence...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you don't know anything about cesar's finger, do you, trevor?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{sometimes a person just runs out of bad choices. then he's gotta pay a price. what happened to cesar was inevitable.}
<A>__{ellen flickers a terrified smile.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you're scaring me.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{we make choices in life and we live by 'em. you and i chose to be teachers, to stand on principle. benny and cesar, they're takers. they want what they want, and they want it now.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{trevor...}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(unravelling)}
<D>__{i'm sorry but everyone can't always get what they want. sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle? they haven't. you think those punks would die protecting your civil rights?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{trevor, don't.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{did you know cesar hits his mother? steals money from her purse? did you know that?}
<A>__{ellen blanches.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{did you know he was here that night? in the alley?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{cesar. jack was provoked. it wasn't an accident, ellen. cesar killed him.}
<A>__{ellen just stares at him. traumatized...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(momentous deliberation)}
<D>__{where'd you get the rosary beads?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(pause and...)}
<D>__{i like you, ellen. i like you so much. do you believe that?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(riveted)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{trevor can't find words.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{... i don't know you.}
<A>__{with that, ellen turns and walks out of the house as quickly as she came.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(plaintively)}
<D>__{... you do know me. i'm a teacher, just like you.}
