<L>__{exterior wooded path afternoon}
<A>__{marion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady pace. nathan and samuel run behind, less winded than their father. marion makes up with cold fury what he lacks in youth.}
<L>__{exterior wooded hillside afternoon}
<A>__{marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill. slows. crawls the last few feet. nathan and samuel just behind him. looks over the hillside. a path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below. marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for advantage. he points.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{nathan, there. samuel, there.}
<A>__{the boys go where they're told.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will fire first. then, nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to gabriel. samuel, kill the last man in the line.}
<A>__{they stagger under the weight of the orders. marion notices but continues.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{after that, samuel, load for nathan. if something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill. hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to aunt charlotte's farm.}
<A>__{the boys hesitate. marion looks at them firmly.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{boys... steady. nathan & samuel yes, father.}
<A>__{marion disappears into the underbrush.}
<B>__{down the path}
<A>__{the dozen redcoats approach. leading gabriel on the rope.}
<B>__{ahead of them}
<A>__{marion waits in the thick undergrowth. on the hillside, nathan and samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look. the redcoats enter the glen. marion waits, then picks his moment and fires, killing the redcoat lieutenant with a shot to the chest. nathan and samuel instantly fire, dropping the last redcoat in the line and the one holding gabriel's rope. the redcoats stop in confusion... gabriel kneels, out of the line of fire. the redcoat sergeant takes command...}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{form by twos! back to back lines...}
<A>__{marion kills the sergeant with a shot to the throat... samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with nathan who fires, dropping another redcoat.}
<C>__{redcoat corporal}
<D>__{ready...}
<A>__{marion fires, killing the corporal, the last man of rank... marion ducks to the side as a volley of redcoat musket fire tears into the spot marked by marion's rifle smoke... from this moment on, marion never stops moving. he strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush, offering only glimpses of himself. he changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving. he never gives the redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock. it's an indian tactic and it works. the redcoats track him with their barrels, about to fire... marion suddenly stops dead, reverses direction, several redcoats fire and miss. six redcoats left. some primed, some reloading. a redcoat draws a bead on marion who drops to the ground and fires, killing him. samuel, weeping as he loads, hands a primed musket to nathan who fires... the redcoats turn their attention to the spot marked by nathan's smoke... marion sees the redcoats aiming toward the boys. he instantly strides out into the open, drawing the redcoats' attention from his sons... marion fires both his pistols, killing two redcoats... one redcoat finishes reloading... marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and slams him in the face with the butt of the musket... this is a different marion, a vicious, savage marion, killing with stunning brutality... marion drops his own expended rifle and catches the redcoat's loaded musket before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another redcoat's belly and fires... two redcoats left, neither finished loading... marion charges, drawing his tomahawk, ignores a glancing bayonet wound to the neck, hacks a redcoat open... splattering himself with blood... the final redcoat, a cherubic face young man, ducks into the woods... marion tears after him... a footrace... the young redcoat blasting through the brush... the older marion, panting, losing ground... a clearing... the redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side... marion throws his tomahawk which flies through the air and sinks in the redcoat's back... marion runs to the wounded redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and slits his throat... then, without pausing, marion wrenches the tomahawk from the redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons...}
<B>__{at the glen}
<A>__{nathan and a weeping samuel, stunned at the carnage, stumble down the hillside toward gabriel. marion runs up and motions for them to stop. marion, checks the redcoats, making sure they're all dead.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{samuel, reload. nathan, untie gabriel.}
<A>__{they quickly do so as marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush. in a moment they're ready. marion finds his own pennsylvania rifle, then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush.}
