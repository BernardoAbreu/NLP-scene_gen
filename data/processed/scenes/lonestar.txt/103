<L>__{exterior parking lot, big o's night}
<A>__{the neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a light within. sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches the door }
<L>__{interior club}
<A>__{the door opens. the place is empty now except for otis, standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with hollis, sitting on a stool. both swivel to look around guiltily as they hear sam step in }
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to the two men }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fellas.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{hey, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{open late.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{i'm not open. we were just talking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hollis probably told you we found charley wade.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{yeah. how about that? people start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.}
<A>__{he sits a few stools away from hollis }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you two saw it, didn't you? you two saw it when buddy killed him.}
<A>__{hollis and 0tis look at each other }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{imonna find out one way or the other.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, and my mother was a sainterior for fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. but hell, what's that? you got a problem? buddy'll fix it. facing some time in jail? buddy'll knock half of it off if you do what he says, when he says. you got some business that's not exactly legal? talk to buddy }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{buddy deeds }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{buddy deeds was a murderer.}
<A>__{he looks at the two older men for a long moment }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that night in the cafe he didn't stay long after you left, did he, hollis? maybe he decided he'd gone too far with wade, maybe he figured he better not wait for the sheriff to get behind him. so he stepped out to see if he could catch up and you were here at the club that night, weren't you, o?}
<A>__{otis sighs, begins to speak softly }
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{i was here.}
<B>__{cu otis}
<A>__{he turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we pan away with his gaze }
<C>__{otis }
<D>__{i'd been running a game on the side after hours craps, draw poker on the weekends. roderick didn't know about it. more important, charley wade didn't know about it, 'cause i didn't want to cut him in. i suppose i'd been drinking some, and i was pretty full of myself in those days but hell, i just didn't expect the man so early }
<A>__{sheriff wade and young hollis step in the door and we are back in 1957. blues harmonica fades up, wailing from the jukebox. they stop and look at the place their pov club music continues. the club is empty, dark. a light shines from the back room.}
