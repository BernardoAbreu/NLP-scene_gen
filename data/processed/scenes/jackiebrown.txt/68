<A>__{we're outside the del amo ua cinemas, a six screen theater that's been in the del amo mall since the early seventies. a small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema, having just watched their matinee. max cherry is among them. he exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.}
<B>__{back to jackie and ordell}
<A>__{in the food court. ordell rises from the table. jackie moves a broadway bag towards him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{don't forget your bag.}
<A>__{he takes it. we follow with ordell out of the food court, when he stops... ... he see max cherry strolling through the mall. ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view. "what the fuck is max cherry doing here?" as ordell watches, he sees max head towards the food court.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{walks into the food court. he stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him. as he tries to decide, he hears from behind him;}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{max.}
<A>__{max turns and sees jackie siting there drinking her iced tea, smoking her mild seven, and smiling up at him. max smiles back.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, hello.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{surprise.}
<A>__{he approaches her table.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i walked right past you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i know, ignoring me. what're you up to?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{catching a movie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what'd ya see?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{"american prseident"}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how was it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{pretty good. me and annette bening are goin steady.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, are you? does she know that?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(sitting down at the table)}
<D>__{... i don't believe she's ever heard of me. but that doesn't mean we're not going steady.}
<B>__{back to ordell}
<A>__{watching max sit down and make himself comfortable at jackie's table.}
<C>__{ordell}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what's up with this shit.}
<B>__{back to max and jackie}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{does it happen to all men?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, i'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. there's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. but there's always one who you love. and with her it's sorta like going steady.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and annette's it for you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for now. these relationships never last too long.}
<A>__{with a smile on her face;}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's a goddam man for ya. can't even be faithful to a fuckin' movie star.}
<A>__{max smiles.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who was your girl before annette?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sandra bullock. you know her?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "speed." she's cute.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{she's adorable. but i had to end it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm old enough to be her father.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how old's annette?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{gesturing to the broadway bags on the table.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what're you, a bag lady?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i go back to work tomorrow.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you talk them into it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{they seem to like the idea.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{bring the money in and they follow it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yea, but i'm going to dress it up. put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you don't actually do it that way?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he always just picked it up at my place. but with a.t.f. involved, i want to stage it. you know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. then it's up to ray nicolet, the a.t. f. guy to follow the shopping bag.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{make the delivery somewhere in the mall.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{right around here, in the food court.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sit down, leave the bag under the table?}
<A>__{jackie nods her head "yes."}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{will ordell go for that?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm helping him bring his money into america. he loves the idea. you just missed him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he was here?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah, we were goin' over everything. that's why all the bags.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i called you last night.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i know, i got your message. ray wanted to have dinner. he wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. that's what he calls it. a sting. he's being real nice to me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you think he's got a thing for you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{maybe. but i'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't follow your logic. what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell's money?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he's setting me up to make a proposition.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{has he hinted around?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{not really. but i knew this narcotics cop one time. told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. his exact words.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know some interesting people.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?}
<A>__{she shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he tries to act cool.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no harm in that. he's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. i know the type, trust me on this. he's more interested in ordell than the money. if he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. it's evidence.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what about you max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what? if i was in nicolet's place?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no, i mean you, right now. not it you were somebody else.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you know where it came from. it's not like it's anybody's life savings. it wouldn't even be missed.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{a half a million dollars will always be missed.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're avoiding the question.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{okay, sure. i might be tempted. especially now, since i'm getting out of the bail bonds business.}
<A>__{jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she doesn't say anything. max continues.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i have to stand behind all my active bonds, but i'm not writing any new ones.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{a lot of reasons. but the main one would be i'm tired of it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{when did you decide?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's been a long time coming. i finally made up my mind i guess it was thursday.}
