<L>__{interior doc's office}
<A>__{dark and shadowy. at the far end of a hallway an insipid light bulb burns. macreedy goes toward it, entering...}
<L>__{interior doc's lab}
<A>__{devoted to the care and preservation of the dear departed. in the center of the room is a long rectangular slab stained with the juices of those unfortunates who have had occasion to rest thereon. the walls are lined with rickety bookcases jammed, not with volumes, but with the jugs and jars, the chemicals and unguents of doc's multiple callings. in a corner three or four neat pine boxes are stacked one on the other. doc sits at a cluttered desk feeding a large bowl of goldfish and sipping a glass of milk. he looks up as macreedy enters.}
