<L>__{interior george's garage night}
<A>__{george is brushing his teeth, dribbling and foaming over the only sink in the garage. sam is propped up in bed with guster, dressed on top of the sheets, fingering through a stack of cd's. he glances over at his father twice before speaking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you look like shit, lately.}
<A>__{george spits and rinses, facing sam as he wipes his mouth.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you look better than ever.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't think mom cares that much that my...that peter left.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she seemed upset.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's wrong with your back?}
<A>__{sam tries to look slightly less interested than he is by continuing to flip through the cd's. george sits down.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. and you're going through them quick.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{are you taking them still?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, but i count them. in a sock isn't new, you know?}
<A>__{this is not easy for george; he fumbles a bit before answering.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm having a problem with cancer.}
<A>__{sam stops flipping though the cd's.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know what that means. what kind of problem?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the kind where there isn't really an answer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i still don't know what that means.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i wanted you here so we could have a few months together. maybe everything happens for a reason. something bad to force something good.}
<A>__{sam looks somewhat panicked.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? are you dying?}
<A>__{this is not easy for george; he fumbles a bit before answering.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm having a problem with cancer.}
<A>__{sam stops flipping through the cd's.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know what that means. what kind of problem?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the kind where there isn't really an answer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i still don't know what that means.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i wanted you here so we could have a few months together. maybe everything happens for a reason. something bad to force something good.}
<A>__{sam looks somewhat panicked.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? are you dying?}
<A>__{george nods his head.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{and you told mom today?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{sam whacks the cd's off his stomach; they scatter across the floor. guster scoots off the bed in a panic.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fuck you! you knew you were dying from the start!}
<A>__{sam bounds out of bed in a rage.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we're all dying from the start.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i just got picked for advanced placement.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you lied to me!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i would have lied to me if i thought i'd believe it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this was all for your sake, wasn't it? having me here? trying to get me to like you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i never tried to get you to like me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i tried to get you to love me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, congratulations! you fucking pulled it off!}
<A>__{sam storms out of the garage.}
