<L>__{exterior red light district, montreuil night}
<A>__{fantine is out on the snow and ice covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. she looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. she moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. then she comes to a stop, staring. she has seen and recognised valjean, some way off. he's out in the harbour district. he is talking to a beggar. before he moves on, he hands over some money. as fantine watches valjean on his mission of mercy, a well dressed young man, bamatabois, comes up to her. he arrives with two friends and a valet.}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<D>__{here's something new. i think i will give it a try. come closer, you! i like to see what i buy. the usual price for just one slice of your pie.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{i don't want you! no! no, m'sieur! let me go!}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<D>__{is this a trick? i won't pay more!}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{no, not at all!}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<D>__{you've got some nerve, you little slut! you've got some gall! it's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer the customer sees what he gets in advance it's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir" it's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance!}
<A>__{he pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down her cleavage. fantine reacts with fury. they fall over in the snow and bamatabois laughs.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{i will kill you, you bastard! try any of that! even a whore who has gone to the bad won't be had by a rat!}
<A>__{fantine scratches bamatabois across the face. bamatabois touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. his friends drag fantine against the harbour wall.}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<P>__{(furious but aroused)}
<D>__{by christ you'll pay for what you've done! this rat will make you bleed, you'll see! i guarantee i will make you suffer! for this disturbance of the peace for this insult to life and property!}
<A>__{bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{i beg you, don't report me, sir. i will do whatever you may want.}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<D>__{make your excuse to the police!}
<A>__{bamatabois' friend drags fantine towards the police. it's javert.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{tell me quickly what's the story. who saw what and why and where? let him give a full description, let him answer to javert! in this nest of whores and vipers let one speak who saw it all. who laid hands on this good man here? what's the substance of this brawl?}
<C>__{bamatabois}
<D>__{javert, would you believe it? i was walking, it was dark when this prostitute attacked me you can see she's left her mark!}
<A>__{he shows the blood. javert turns to fantine.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{she will answer for her actions when you make a full report. you may rest assured, m'sieur, that she will answer to the court.}
<A>__{fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. unseen by her, valjean is approaching from behind. javert's assistants pick fantine up. javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he approaches fantine.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{there's a child who sorely needs me, please, m'sieur, she's but that high. holy god, is there no mercy? if i go to jail she'll die.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{i have heard such protestations every day for twenty years. let's have no more explanations,}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{javert }
<D>__{save your breath and save your tears.}
<A>__{javert indicates to the two policemen to drag fantine away. valjean steps out of the shadows.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{a moment of your time, javert. i do believe this woman's tale.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur le mayor!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{you've done your duty. let her be. she needs a doctor, not a jail.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur le mayor!}
<A>__{javert looks on, containing his anger, as valjean reaches out a hand to fantine. to fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream }
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{can this be?}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{where will she end this child without a friend?}
<A>__{he holds fantine's hands, looking into her face.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i've seen your face before. show me some way to help you. how have you come to grief in such a place as this?}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{m'sieur, don't mock me now, i pray it's hard enough i've lost my pride. you let your foreman send me away. yes, you were there and turned aside. i never did no wrong.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{is it true what i've done }
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{my daughter's close to dying.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{ to an innocent soul?}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{if there's a god above }
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{had i only known then!}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{he'd let me die instead.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{in his name my task has just begun. i will her to the hospital.}
<A>__{valjean picks fantine up in his arms. javert is quietly coldly furious.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur le mayor!}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{bring cosette back to me.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{at an inn in montfermeil...}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur le mayor!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i will see it done! i will send for her immediately!}
<A>__{as valjean and fantine move away, javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them.}
