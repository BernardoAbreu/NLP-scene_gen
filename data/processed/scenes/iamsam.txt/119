<A>__{sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with rita toward margaret brown's office. suddenly, rita stops as she and sam both see }
<B>__{lucy}
<A>__{sitting, hopeful on the bench. she searches sam's face for the verdict. the minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she knows. she runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{no daddy! no daddy! no daddy!}
<A>__{in a series of wordless dissolves, they hold each other in the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit. the only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the background. pained, margaret reaches for lucy.}
<C>__{margaret brown}
<D>__{c'mon, lucy. it's time to say goodbye.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{noooo! don't let go don't let go don't let go }
<A>__{sam's tears mix with lucy's as they sob, clinging to each other. with such fierce love; a parent and a child.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{don't let them daddy don't let them! don't ever let me go!}
<A>__{he can't let her go. that he can't do. margaret, steel herself, turns to rita, no matter how many times she's done this.}
<C>__{margaret brown}
<D>__{please help me.}
<A>__{rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head, no. now, margaret literally has to wrench lucy away from her father's arms. lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway. sam is frozen in incalculable pain.}
