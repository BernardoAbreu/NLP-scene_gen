<A>__{samuel sits at his baby grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'delibes'. his american wife lisa stands away from him. just the sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance. she tells him:}

<D>__{a man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. only the amount matters.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{and bankruptcy. where will that put me in the social strata?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm only asking for one thing. and it's not an extravagance. it's not even for me; it's for our daughter.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{our daughter.}
<A>__{she turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts to look at her. she stares, plays him like chinese checkers.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{our child's safety is at stake.}

<D>__{these people are professionals. they don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.}

<A>__{she just stares at him. he melts.}
