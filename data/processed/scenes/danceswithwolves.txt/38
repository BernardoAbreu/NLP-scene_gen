<L>__{exterior bluff day}
<A>__{as dunbar comes over the hill, he sees the wagon has ground to a stop. the wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff. dunbar and timmons are peering into the little valley below}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{not what you'd call a going concern.}
<A>__{the wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down. we see the pathetic remains of fort sedgewick.}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick day}
<A>__{a full view of the deserted fort. timmons sits on the wagon by himself.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{ain't nothin' here lieutenant.}
<A>__{dunbar appears from cargill's former quarters.}
<C>__{timmons }
<D>__{everybody's run off... or got kilt.}
<A>__{the lieutenant looks briefly at timmons, and marches over to the caved in supply house. again he ducks inside. dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at the wagon driver.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{alright...lets unload the wagon.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{what, and leave it all here?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i'm staying too... we don't know what's happened.}
<A>__{dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{there ain't nothin' here lieutenant.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{not at the moment, no.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{so things bein' the way they are we might as well turn around and get started back.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{this is my post...}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{this is my... are you crazy boy?}
<A>__{the lieutenant's eyes have gone absolutely black. the heel of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long revolver at his hip.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{this is my post! and these are the post's provisions. now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload.}
<A>__{timmons leaps down.}
