<L>__{interior building corridor night}
<A>__{dean races for the stairwell two steps at a time. he hears the sound of a door opening somewhere below.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{303 to 301. floor one secured. moving to two.}
<A>__{dean retreats upward, then he hears someone coming down. trapped. he opens the door on '3' and is about to run when he sees a security camera directly above. grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. spray coats the lens. then he yanks a fire alarm. a horn blares. dean runs for the second stairwell when he sees jones stepping out. dean looks back at the stairwell he left. that door's opening as well. trapped. using the extinguisher, dean smashes the glass door to an office and goes inside. jones starts to enter when a shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. he retreats as the blaring fire alarm stops. dean races through the suite of offices trying locked door after locked door. finally, one opens and he rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself. no lock. he sees the men and they see him. he slides a desk against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.}
<C>__{jones }
<P>__{(disturbingly calm)}
<D>__{open the door, mr. dean. there's nowhere to go. we'd just like to talk.}
<A>__{seeing a phone, dean grabs it. no tone. just a recording of nancy sinatra's song "these boots are made for walking".}
<C>__{jones }
<D>__{it'd be easier for all of us if you just come out. nothing'll happen.}
<A>__{dean heaves a coffee table up on the desk.}
<C>__{jones }
<D>__{it's quite hopeless what you're doing, mr. dean.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i swear to god i will shoot.}
<C>__{jones }
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i think you might be over reacting there, mr. dean. we just want to talk.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{go ahead. i hear you fine.}
<A>__{the door pushes in }
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{i said i will shoot!}
<A>__{the door keeps pushing. dean fires high. the pushing stops. then dean hears the distant sound of sirens approaching. dean rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and sets the sweater on fire. he throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam cups in on top of it. the pushing starts again, but before dean can fire, a small cylindrical device drops into the room.}
<B>__{a stun grenade.}
<A>__{dean ducks as a blinding flash rocks the room. the window is blown open. smoke billows out. dean, temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as fire engines arrive.}
