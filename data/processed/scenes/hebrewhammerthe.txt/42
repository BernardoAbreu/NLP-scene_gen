<A>__{a wide shot of the bar. the camera is stationary. we hear the sound of shotguns blasting and then the sounds of intense fighting. a few seconds of the fighting sounds pass. suddenly, the front doors bust open and a few bloodied skinheads fall out onto the ground, followed by the hammer. he's untouched, and he carries the bottle of manischewitz in one hand and a shotgun in the other. he stops in the midground, and pours the manischewitz out on the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner. he approaches foreground, and pulls out something from his jacket pocket. we see a cu of the same matchbook the elf gave him. "duke's where skin is in." he lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. we hear the sounds of bursting flames. the hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past the camera. we pull back into a spinning overhead to reveal flames in the shape of the star of david burning on the lawn.}
