<L>__{exterior bear creek community reservation day}
<A>__{the federal car drives out of the community and further into vast bluffs and strange rock formations where it is swallowed, leaving the ramshackle village in dust. a lone dog all its ribs showing chases, barking.}
<L>__{exterior badlands short time later}
<A>__{we are on the moon. or israel. but not america. not any america we've ever seen. a thirty mile eroded landscape of dunes and crevices, soft rock strata and fossils. barren. and eerie. a lakota death song underscores the otherworldly ambiance of this place as shoes scuff through the gumbo and multi colored stones. two pair of black, spit shined, lace ups. three. tripping. scuffing. and then a fourth pair. but they are not loafers. they are georgio brutini's and they belong to ray, as he and cooch follow two special agents from the regional office. sa miles is about cooch's age, balding. sa sherman is closer to ray's age but instead of a suit like the rest, he favors an army green jacket. neither is a south dakota shit kicker but transplanted field agents. all four shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the badlands it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters become faces. it plays mischief on the eye, making ray and sherman nearly trip on }
<B>__{a dead body}
<A>__{lying face down in the rainbow sand. dried blood and horse flies cover his blown out torso. the agents stand over him, breathless from the rugged walk.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{who found him?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{indian kids. hunting fossils.}
<A>__{cooch studies the body from where he stands. sherman hands a file over to ray.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{okay. i think agent levoi and i can proceed from here. what are your call signals?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{px 10 and 11. anything we can do to help you out, just radio.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{good. thanks, guys.}
<A>__{the agents start back through the badlands. ray is already squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose with a kerchief while looking in the file. cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. flies buzz on and around the corpse.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo fast elk... thirty seven... single... member of the tribal council.}
<A>__{cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. he holds a hand out to ray and the younger agent turns the file over.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{looks like fast elk wasn't fast enough to outrun that load. what do you make of the damage?}
<A>__{ray gets closer, swats at flies with the folder.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{six rounds. 357.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{that's what it looks like, doesn't it? but that's what a ten gauge, choke bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.}
<A>__{ray looks up impressed. cooch rises and walks off gingerly, scanning the surroundings.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ray.}
<A>__{cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. ray walks over, carefully. he follows cooch's frown down at the twisted layers of earth.}
<B>__{on the ground}
<A>__{a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight up, dancing in the wind. cooch and ray each lower themselves to their haunches to study the strange sight. cooch puts his reading glasses on, stares at it. then lights a cigarette. ray hefts up a camera and begins clicking off shots. he starts moving around it, taking shots at different angles. and then the sound of a distant motor draws both agent's attention.}
