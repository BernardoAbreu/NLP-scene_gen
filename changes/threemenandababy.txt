<LOC>__{INT. AIRPLANE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport. JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is seated beside him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne. In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass- engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to be a BUSINESSMAN. The plane is flying over the coastline. The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning around to look at the passengers.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Paul)}
<DIAL>__{Oh my God! I can't believe my eyes! Look at these women! Will you look at the gorgeous calves on them?! I'm telling you, give me an athlete any day... Oh God! Look at that redhead over there, and look at that one! Christ, I hadn't noticed her.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(miming a heart attack)}
<DIAL>__{Paul, I've just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the world...}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(totally uninterested)}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah? Which one?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as though about to keel over)}
<DIAL>__{The blonde over there, she's too gorgeous for words. Just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she moves. I'm in love. Here, take over, I'll be right back.}
<ACTION>__{Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls. Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who are blocking the way, to the object of his affections. She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and intensely, to her.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello.   I'm the captain of this plane.   May I ask your name?}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure, my name is Jane.    Why?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, Jane, I've seen many beautiful women in my life but I swear to you, I've never, ever met a woman as exquisite as you are.}
<ACTION>__{Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him, amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jane, can you feel my heart? It's pounding. This is horrible, I think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm madly in love with you, I'm single and here's my phone number.}
<ACTION>__{He hands her his business card.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm putting my fate in your hands. If you don't call me, you'll make me the most miserable man on earth. This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. I love you Jane and if you call me I'll be the happiest man in the entire universe -- this is 'love at first sight.' Out of all these beautiful women I noticed only you, and...}
<ACTION>__{The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi- nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to Jack.}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, I'm the pilot...}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(annoyed)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, the copilot -- he's up front...}
<ACTION>__{The Businessman disappears in the direction of the cockpit.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(back to Jane)}
<DIAL>__{I'm leaving it all up to you, Jane, but if you do give me your phone number, then Jane, then...}

<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about the stuff?}
<CHAR>__{BUSINESSMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't have it. We've got problems. Too much heat. Too risky. We think the cops are on to us.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whadda ya mean us?   You mean me?}
<CHAR>__{BUSINESSMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I mean shut up and listen. Two guys will be waiting for you in a black T-Bird, expecting the dope. Just ignore them. It'll be delivered to you on Sunday and picked up the following Thursday, okay?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But I won't be home, I'll be in the air for two weeks.}
<CHAR>__{BUSINESSMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's your problem. Make arrangements, a deal's a deal. Got it!?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Got it.}
<ACTION>__{Jack returns.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(bursting with excitement)}

<DIAL>__{That's some magnificent view, isn't it?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's wonderful -- Life is wonderful!}
<ACTION>__{The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs hold of the microphone.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is your captain speaking. In honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most beautiful gymnast I have ever met. I'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics -- reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip...}
<ACTION>__{Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the Businessman, who remain grim. Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the cliffs along the coast. It is a beautiful, impressive stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the passengers.}
<LOC>__{INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go. Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God, what a woman!}
<ACTION>__{Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wanna share a cab? Paul Yeah, sure!}
<ACTION>__{A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She's so beautiful! I've never been so in love before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number... Oh, Christ -- where is it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I lost it... It's a matter of life and death... Oh here it is -- thank God!}
<ACTION>__{All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON, is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him.}
<CHAR>__{GRATON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They're slowing down.    Take a picture.}
<ACTION>__{The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul. The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it. Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, I need a favor, I got a little problem.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you -- look at that sparkling beauty.}
<ACTION>__{A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.}

<DIAL>__{Yeah... I mean, it's like... There's this little package...}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She'll never make it with all that luggage she's got. I gotta give her a hand. Look at the colors in her hair! Christ, I've never seen a woman like her before...}
<ACTION>__{He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jack, listen, can I...}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure you can, no problem... Listen, I gotta go now, I'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me.  You take the shuttle, okay?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But I gotta explain to you about...}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come over to my place tonight. We're having a huge party. Come around 9, okay? See ya later.}
<ACTION>__{Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what he's saying.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{As exquisite as you are... I think I'm gonna faint.}
<ACTION>__{He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart. The young woman is flabbergasted. A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.}
<LOC>__{INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan. A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner, Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair. She is laughing as she listens to him.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(whispering passionately)}
<DIAL>__{This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. This is 'love at first sight.' Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I'll be right back.}
<ACTION>__{Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA. They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it.}
<CHAR>__{SOPHIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art? Well then you explain why.}
<CHAR>__{MICHAEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It goes back to prehistoric man. They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake.}

<DIAL>__{Wait one second for me, I'll be right back.}
<ACTION>__{Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie. Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman, NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation.}
<CHAR>__{NICOLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You guys have a beautiful place here. But the rent must be a killer.}
<ACTION>__{Peter isn't paying attention.}
<CHAR>__{NICOLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Isn't it a killer?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?...}
<CHAR>__{PETER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Oh,    the rent... yeah, it's high but    split between the three of us    it isn't that bad, as long as    we don't eat.}

<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack, have you seen him?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing? Yeah, sure, I'll take you to Jack.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Nicole)}

<ACTION>__{They move away.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're a lifesaver, I've been trying to get away from that woman for 20 minutes. That sonofabitch Carl is moving in on my Natalie. Gotta go... bye.}

<DIAL>__{Wait -- What about Jack?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(in a hurry)}
<DIAL>__{He's around somewhere.     Check under all the couches.}
<ACTION>__{Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter, who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.}

<DIAL>__{Oh Natalie, I've been looking for you all night.}
<CHAR>__{CARL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Ours is incredible too.}
<CHAR>__{CARL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you ever get it finished.}
<ACTION>__{Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine, whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the shoulder.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jack, can I talk to you for a second?}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Yeah... What kind of favor? Damn, I've got to get her a glass of champagne.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, I've got a little problem. I'm having a valuable package delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm not going to be home. I've got to do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia route, so can I have the package delivered here instead?}

<DIAL>__{Yeah, sure, of course.}

<DIAL>__{Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday. Got it. No problem.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is a very delicate matter, Jack. It's very important they don't tell anybody about this package. It could be very... uh, embarrassing for me, you know what I'm saying?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure. You got it.    I'll see you later...}
<ACTION>__{Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie.     Paul grabs his arm.}

<DIAL>__{'I heard you're not ready yet.' 'We're gonna kick your ass.' Well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe I haven't scored with Natalie yet, but neither has he. She's not an easy lay, that's what I like about her.

<DIAL>__{Michael, all you want to do is steal Jack's girl friends. You don't give a shit about the women themselves...}
<CHAR>__{MICHAEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Everything's on the floor, it's all been smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti- ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In its place, utter devastation and shambles. Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's nowhere to be seen. Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan- ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his eyes. Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES.   They're coming from the back bathroom. Peter rushes to   it, practically ripping the door from its hinges. There   on the toilet is the basket, and on it there's a note  written in big messy printing which says: "NEXT TIME   WE TAKE HER." Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape. A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room. Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's    room and looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been    caught kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from   her, hold- ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on    his bed and exits the room.}
