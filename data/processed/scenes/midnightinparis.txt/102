<D>__{that immediate magic one hears about happened to me. i know that both picasso and hemingway are in love with me but for whatever inexplicable reasons the heart has, i am drawn to gil. perhaps because he seems naive and unassuming.}
<C>__{guide}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{as always in this sad life he is about to marry a woman named inez. i had a dream where he came to me and brought me a little gift earrings they were and we made love. perhaps it is just as well i accept hemingway's offer to go to africa. life with pablo is too full of conflict and i am suffocating under his genius. why i need to go from one brilliant man to another is my weakness. gil is different, perhaps not a genius but not moody and selfish like pablo or amedeo was. i think a trip to africa with hemingway would help get these feelings for gil off my mind.}
