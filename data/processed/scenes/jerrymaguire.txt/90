<L>__{interior bob sugar's hotel room day}
<A>__{bob sugar talks on his hotel phone.}
<C>__{sugar}
<D>__{it's sugar. he must be there, right? just sniff or something if he's there.}
<P>__{(jerry sniffs, panicked)}
<D>__{alright, buddydude. just remember. you're swimming with the big boys now. you let your dad do all the talking. i'm the one who got you the deal you needed. this is business not friendship. be strong. you're global now.}
<A>__{sugar hangs up.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{"no comment.}
<A>__{jerry hangs up. the room is still laughing. his head is spinning.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{hey, it's cush on the big t.v. again!}
<C>__{cush}
<D>__{hell, i'm already sick of me. i got "cushlash."}
<A>__{more laughs. jerry sits across from matt, reeling quietly. he speaks casually, directly.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{look, before i go back to denver. i think we should put something down on paper. something that says, "hey, i'm with jerry maguire."}
<A>__{he pulls out a yellow legal tablet. he scribbles a few lines, as matt looks increasingly nervous.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not right now, jerry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{do i know everything there is to know here?}
<P>__{(silent beat)}
<D>__{you fellas aren't talking with bob sugar, are you?}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{apparently, denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{said who? sugar?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, i'm learning as i go.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{so you empowered bob sugar to deal with denver behind my back?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i brought denver to twenty million. denver deals with me all the time. you listened to sugar? you let that snake in the door.}
<A>__{jerry touches the coffee table. calms himself.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's okay. you want denver. i will fix this up. you didn't sign anything with sugar, right?}
<A>__{another rough silence is broken by little brother keith.}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(blurts)}
<D>__{mr. maguire, someday i'm gonna be a famous athlete and i'm gonna sign with you'.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... sorry.}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(sympathy for jerry)}
<D>__{s' cool.}
<A>__{shot moves in on jerry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{now. wait. you didn't actually sign with sugar, did you? tell me you didn't sign.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because i'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we signed an hour ago. you were in the lobby with the black fella.}
<A>__{jerry moans. silently, he rises and begins to gather his things. cush hangs on to his guitar.}
<C>__{cush}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jerry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{they say it's show "business," jerry, not show friends.}
<A>__{jerry takes a breath before he exits. he surveys the room, settling on cush. visible behind maguire is times square, in all it's neon logo glory.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well. okay. of course. you're twenty years old, and i'm just another guy in a suit. it's all business. it didn't work out. you didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm. let me see, there's a speech that i'm supposed to make right! "i will be out there cheering for you." "the door is always open!" see? i'm a class act.}
<P>__{(breath, directly)}
<D>__{but maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now i will never know. you'll never know. weren't you curious?}
<P>__{(they aren't)}
<D>__{no. okay, well, i will be fine. and you'll be fine. and keith i bope you do call me.}
<A>__{flushed and embarrassed, he exits. we hang a beat on the silent cushman hotel livingroom, as cush now continues on guitar.}
