<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior an old warehouse later}
<A>__{hub, who sits in a beat up old car, a baseball cap worn backwards on his head. he keys his radio.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{all units, report in turn. if talking will reveal your position, just key your walkie...}
<A>__{an old warehouse red hook inside, an auto garage. hoists, compression cylinders, archwelders. outside, two winos share a bottle by the curb. a beat up dodge drives up. in it, two scruffy looking black men. upon close inspection we realize that one is hub. the other is floyd.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(to a mechanic)}
<D>__{yo...}
<A>__{the mechanic looks out from under a car. he's hispanic.}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{que pasa?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{tariq around?}
<A>__{the mechanic gestures to a partitioned office in the back. as hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.}
<B>__{in the office}
<A>__{tariq is on the phone talking in arabic as hub enters.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{tariq?}
<A>__{tariq holds up a finger, hold on. hub sits opposite him.}
<C>__{tariq}
<D>__{how can i help you.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you're tariq husseini?}
<C>__{tariq}
<D>__{he's out.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{damn. do you think you could give him a message?}
<C>__{tariq}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{tell him the fbi is after him.}
<C>__{tariq}
<D>__{you're joking.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{very... slowly... put your hands on top of the table.}
<A>__{tariq notices that hub's hands are out of sight beneath the table. hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an audible click. tariq mutters a curse in arabic.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{that wouldn't be a racist epithet, now would it? stand up.}
<A>__{as tariq stands, hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs, pats him down, and cuffs him. meanwhile in the warehouse the two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun wielding fbi agents and are now rousting the garage workers.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{where are the others?}
<C>__{tariq}
<D>__{what others?}
<A>__{but before hub can answer, an amplified voice is heard.}
<P>__{psy ops (v.o.)}
<D>__{tariq husseini, this is the united states army. you are surrounded.}
<A>__{hub is as surprised as tariq.}
<D>__{psy ops you have thirty seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head.}
<A>__{one of the agents with the shotgun calls out.}
<C>__{shotgun agent}
<D>__{ sir?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{do as he says.}
<A>__{as hub hustles tariq to his feet, the other agents start to hustle the workers out of door, when:}
<B>__{the young mechanic}
<A>__{reaches into his overalls.}
<C>__{shotgun agent}
<D>__{freeze !}
<A>__{but when the mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls, all he is holding is the pin to a grenade.}
<B>__{the explosion}
<A>__{kills both the fbi agents and their prisoners. hub throws tariq to the ground.}
<B>__{from an upper window}
<A>__{an automatic weapon opens fire on the army presence. high above in a chopper devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{code blue.}
<A>__{his order unleashes an overwhelming display of firepower.}
<B>__{inside the warehouse}
<A>__{hub and tariq crawl for cover as windows explode, walls are shredded, and incendiary tracer rounds mix with solvents and gasoline to start a conflagration. with the vaguely hallucinatory quality of the s.l.a. shootout, white noise bleeds in and all sound fades out: an m 60 tank (silent) races in from around the corner, only to be hit by a rocket propelled grenade fired through the second floor window.}
