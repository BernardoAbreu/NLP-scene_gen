<L>__{exterior cottage night}
<A>__{the two men emerge from the house. joe heads for his car. jimmy peels off toward a battered gmc pacer parked at the curb.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{where the hell are you going?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{as long as we're here, i might as well take cory's car.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you got the keys?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah. i will follow you.}
<A>__{hallenbeck starts to turn away. jimmy gets in the car. hallenbeck stops. frowns.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{cory has two cars?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah. this one's just sitting here until she can sell it.}
<A>__{the color drains from hallenbeck's features.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{jimmy, no!!}
<A>__{he sprints across the sidewalk and yanks jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ouch ! what's your problem?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car. swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{they used a car bomb on mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too.}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{except they wired the wrong car.}
<A>__{jimmy pales noticeably.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh. shit. oh. jeez.}
<A>__{hallenbeck claps him on the back.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{easy, kid. no harm, no foul. we caught it in time.}
<A>__{he strolls toward his plymouth, whistling. cheerfully unaffected. jimmy catches his breath. swallows hard. turns, and bumps into hallenbeck, coming back the other way.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire cutters.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{gotta disconnect the fucker.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{whoa. hold on. um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{relax, junior, i used to do this for a living.}
<A>__{he isolates one wire. turns and offers the cutters to jimmy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you wanna do it?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no, man, i }
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{come on, chickenshit. just snip the wire.}
<A>__{jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. reaches beneath the wheel well. plucks at the wire tentatively. cuts.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{oh, shit not that one!}
<A>__{jimmy screams and stumbles backward. lands on his ass. hallenbeck is chuckling softly. shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you're a fucking asshole!}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{and then some, junior. and then some.}
