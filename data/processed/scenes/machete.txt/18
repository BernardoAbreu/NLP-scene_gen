<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{men circle in an alleyway, laying money down on the ground, placing bets on the two fighters in the makeshift ring. one is a brawny thug with a neck like a tree trunk. the other is strong, but not big. brawny thug makes quick work of his opponent. the men cheer. brawny thug's handler coaxes the crowd for another opponent. machete walks into the alley. brawny thug points at him.}
<C>__{handler}
<D>__{he wants you.}
<A>__{machete keeps walking.}
<C>__{handler }
<D>__{$500 if you lose. $2000 if you win.}
<A>__{machete keeps walking.}
<C>__{handler }
<D>__{hey, you, wetback! you're gonna kiss off $500 for five minutes?}
<A>__{machete stops. rico, a worker, lays a fistful of bills on the ground.}
<C>__{rico}
<D>__{a hundred on the new guy!}
<A>__{handler takes the money, makes a note. bets start flying as money changes hands.}
<C>__{rico }
<D>__{orale! come on!}
<A>__{a benz pulls up into the alley, and a bearded man wearing sunglasses steps out, still in the shadows, watching from a distance. machete and the brawny thug fist fight bareknuckled. brawny gets in several good punches, knocking machete about, but machete comes from behind to lay him out. brawny falls on his face with a sickening crunch. the crowd goes wild. rico pockets his winnings. machete grabs his and walks off around the corner.}
