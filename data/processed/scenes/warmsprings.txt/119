<A>__{roy lifts franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed. eleanor enters holding a lit candle. roy is about to begin franklin's bedtime routine, but eleanor gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{let me.}
<A>__{roy looks to franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits. eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau. after a beat, franklin begins to unbuckle his pants. he then lies back on the bed.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{what is your most pressing concern?}
<A>__{eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so as not to catch on the braces. eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the back of a chair.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{getting a doctor to live on the premises full time. someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress. make us legitimate.}
<A>__{she begins to take off franklin's braces a series of intricate buckles. eleanor slides the braces off his legs. his legs, though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly. he is still wearing his shoes.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{and that costs more money.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{but the real problem is no one is interested. the annual orthopedics convention is being held in atlanta this weekend and i offered to speak.}
<P>__{(his anger surfacing)}
<D>__{they turned me down flat.}
<A>__{eleanor takes franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{a few weeks ago, the conditions at a garment factory on west 27th street were brought to my attention. the owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection.}
<A>__{she reaches for franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated position. they are now face to face.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{it took awhile, but we finally got in.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{he searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become. he starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top. eleanor sits in a chair across from him.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i showed up with someone from the labor board and we refused to leave until they let us in.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what are you suggesting?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{at the risk of my good standing with the junior assistance league, i suggest we crash the party.}
<A>__{she stands and walks over to franklin and runs her hand through his hair.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{good night, franklin.}
<A>__{she goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle lit room.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{good night, babs.}
<A>__{she blows the candle out and closes the door.}
