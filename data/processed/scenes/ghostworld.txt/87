<L>__{interior enid's room later that day}
<A>__{enid is on her bed, crying. her jacket and shoes are strewn about the floor.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{god fuck you too!}
<A>__{we see her dad standing outside her bedroom. as he enters he tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before she really embarrasses herself. she stops crying and pretends to be asleep.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{pumpkin? what's wrong?}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(her back to him, doesn't move)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{if there's something wrong i wish you'd tell me about it...}
<A>__{enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of the bed, facing away from him}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it's nothing it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(speaking slowly and methodically)}
<D>__{well... as you know, maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.}
<A>__{enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before she bursts into tears, utterly defeated.}
