<A>__{we're in new york city. we're in the conference room of a modestly successful cable tv station called "real tv." the people are young, energetic, clever. it's crowded, noisy the furniture is beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards all over them. this room is not for show work gets done here. seven or eight people are present. one of them is cynthia reed. she's the boss.}
