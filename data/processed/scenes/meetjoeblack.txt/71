<L>__{exterior wine bar, lawns, country estate afternoon}
<A>__{ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check of the bar's stock, quince ambles up, in the background the activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{give me a seagrams and '7'.}
<A>__{ambrose looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{quicnce }
<D>__{no got? okay a double v.o., water back.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{i'm afraid this is a wine bar, mr. quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{okay, give me a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{red or white?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{both.}
<A>__{joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting up last minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his traps past on a little cart. joe doesn't seem to know where he is, when his eyes alight on quince, he heads for this oasis. ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.}
<C>__{quince }
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{red or white?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of each into one glass.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{c'mon, have a drink. you look like you need one bad as me.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do i? i'm a little confused.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{confused, huh? about what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{love.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{'love'? oh, man, i've got troubles of my own.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you love allison, don't you?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{oh yes, i do.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how did you meet?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i was a world class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl and for some reason she took me in.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but she loves you?}
<A>__{quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. i mean the deeper, darkest secrets they don't matter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'the deepest, darkest secrets '?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls and then you're free.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what do you mean 'free'?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{free to love each other. com pletely. totally. no fear.}
<A>__{quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{all that hoopla up there reminds me how i will never measure up to a man like bill parrish or his daughter.}
<A>__{he drains his wine.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{do you like me, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh yes, you are one of my favorites.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i told drew and the board that bill depended on you. drew led me on, but i had no business telling him in the first place. he was setting up bill from day one. drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. bontecou was outside, drew was mr. inside. and i was the fool who made it all happen. oh god, what do i do?}
<A>__{joe regards quince.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{go to bill parrish and tell him everything. he'll forgive you.}
<A>__{quince drains one more glass of wine.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you think so? how do you know?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{because that's the kind of man bill parrish is.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, maybe... i guess you know him better than anybody.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ getting to.}
<A>__{the orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks, getting close.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{do you think i should wait to tell him 'till after the party?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully. they look on as the pre party activities swirl on around them.}
