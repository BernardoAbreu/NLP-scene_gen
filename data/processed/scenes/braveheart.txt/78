<L>__{exterior wallace army camp day}
<A>__{the scots are lining up to leave their encampment. wallace is about to give the signal to start the march when hamish, beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{william french guards?}
<A>__{the riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. it is nicolette. wallace and hamish recognize her from the princess's visit. she trots her horse the rest of the way, while the french guards stay back. hamish helps her from her horse. she moves to wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding cape. secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow.}
