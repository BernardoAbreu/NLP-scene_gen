<L>__{interior macguff house kitchen night}
<A>__{mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of bren's weight loss shakes. juno enters.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hi dad.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{hey, big puffy version of junebug. where have you been?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. where is everyone?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{tot ice skating? tots can't ice skate. liberty bell's still getting the hang of stairs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no, but you know bren. she dreams big.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, she does.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you look a little morose, honey. what's eating you?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm losing my faith in humanity.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{think you can narrow it down for me.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i guess i wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you mean like couples?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, like people in love.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{are you having boy trouble? i gotta be honest; i don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{dad, no!}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well, it's kind of skanky. isn't that what you girls call it? skanky? skeevy?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{please stop now.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(persisting)}
<D>__{tore up from the floor up?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{dad, it's not about that. i just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. or at least for a few years.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it's not easy, that's for sure. now, i may not have the best track record in the world, but i have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and i'm proud to say that we're very happy.}
<A>__{juno nods in agreement.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{in my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you, the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass. that's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.}
<A>__{a wave of realization crosses juno's face.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i sort of already have.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well, of course. your old d a d! you know i will always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.}
<A>__{he nods toward her belly.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his cheek.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i need to go out somewhere for just a little while. i don't have any homework, and i swear i will be back by ten.}
<A>__{she salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you were talking about me, right?}
