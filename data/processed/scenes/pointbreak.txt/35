<A>__{whaaaaam! johnny is clobbered by a wave. he's flipped off his board and hits the water face first as the wave crashes over him. other surfers steer clear. pappas lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink shorts, purple vuarnet's and a t shirt emblazoned with "surf this" across the chest. a picnic basket sits close at hand. he winces at utah's wipeout. shouts from his beach chair.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{i think you gotta hit them straight on!}
<C>__{utah}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{got it...}
<A>__{utah holds the tip steady, gouges the face of a wave and squirts out the other side. another wave rises and utah glides up over the hump. he clears the swell and the ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake. triumphant over having made the lineup, he sits up on the board, and falls over. pappas slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off the knife. utah climbs back on his board. whistles and hoots sound as surfers spot a new swell. utah watches as the regulars start catching rides. suddenly he feels like a lost dog on a busy freeway. a young local in a neon wetsuit slashes past him, inches away.}
<C>__{local}
<D>__{outta the way, you dick!}
<A>__{another, shredding viciously, is blasting toward him.}
<C>__{local 2}
<D>__{move it, kook!}
<A>__{johnny paddles rapidly, ducks under. sees another, bigger wave coming. pissed off... at himself, at the downy cheeked hotshots, at the frustration, he turns his board around and starts paddling hard. he somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the top of the board, then struggles up. he's standing sort of. arms pinwheeling, he topples in a nasty crash... right in front of a shaved head surfer on full afterburner. johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray. his board}
<B>__{shoots out.}
<A>__{it smashes sideways into razorhead. the guy does an ugly endo. utah comes up gasping for air, arms flailing. his board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle. he drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath. razorhead, already back on his board, paddles over. points to a small dent in the fiberglass.}
<C>__{razorhead}
<D>__{you dinged my board, kook!!}
<A>__{utah looks up in apology as a crushing right hook smacks his face! knocks him under. razorhead pulls a knife from a sheath held by a thong around his neck. as johnny surfaces, razorhead slashes in a vicious arc severing utah's leash, close to the board. his flame job surfboard bobs away.}
<C>__{razorhead}
<D>__{politeness counts, asshole!}
<A>__{the surf punk plunges under a wave, disappearing.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{goddamn son of a }
<A>__{before utah can finish, another wave engulfs him and he tumbles to shore, razorhead nowhere to be seen. on pappas as johnny's flame job board washes in at his feet. he calmly picks it up as utah staggers into frame out of the knee deep whitewash. johnny rubs his jaw. spits blood.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{kid, maybe this ain't your sport.}
<A>__{utah grabs the board out of pappas' hands and stalks off across the beach.}
