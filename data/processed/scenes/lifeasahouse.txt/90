<L>__{interior alyssa's bathroom morning}
<A>__{sam is showering as alyssa walks in from the bedroom and joins him; no protest is voiced this time around.}
<L>__{interior shower continuous}
<A>__{alyssa smiles at sam as she grabs a wash cloth and slathers it with liquid soap.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's the point of this?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{does everything have to have a point?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's freakish. i don't get it. i'm not really supposed to touch you, but i can look.}
<A>__{alyssa faces sam as she washes her body with the cloth.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{are you sure you're totally into guys?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{josh said...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not gay.}
<A>__{sam glances down at himself; alyssa looks too.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i mean, hello!}
<A>__{they both look up.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i was wondering.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're driving me crazy! do you know what it's like trying to jack off in an armoire?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're off, you know? you're way, way off.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i thought i was helping you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it would help me if i could kiss you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, i don't...no. i thought we were just friends.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. i mean, i hope i'm not the first to say that about you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{okay, but then we'll just be friends. okay?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay. i guess.}
<A>__{sam stands still, unsure of his next move.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{have you ever even kissed a girl?}
<A>__{sam appears shocked she would even ask; he hasn't, but she's not supposed to know that. alyssa makes the move, closes the distance and kisses him. apart, it appears to be something they enjoyed. sam wraps his arms around her, presses himself against her and kisses her again. after a few seconds of making out, sam jerks once, then again as he backs away. alyssa grimaces as she glances down.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{oh, yuck!}
<A>__{alyssa steps into a corner of the shower as sam turns around and rests his forehead on the tile.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{you're scrubbing the shower down.}
