<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i'm not fighting you, jim, i'm just trying to reach you. you've changed.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course, i've changed! my eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane! and now king. don't you think this has something to do with that? can't you see?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(she explodes)}
<D>__{i don't want to see, goddammit! i'm tired. i've had enough! they say you don't have anything anyway! everybody in town's talking. you're ruining this man shaw's life! you're attacking him because he's homosexual! going ahead with this stupid "trial"! did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?}

<D>__{well so do i, goddammit! so do i! i had a life too, y'know i had a life, too. but you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, elizabeth! it's not just about you and your well being and your two cars and your kitchen and your tv and "i'm jes fine honey." while our kids grow up into a shithole of lies! well, i'm not "fine" about that, i'm angry. my life is fucked, liz! and yours is, too! and if you don't want to support me i can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you never talked to me this way before, jim garrison. i'm not making any threats. i'm leaving you. i'm taking the kids to my mother's. i am i am.}

<C>__{jasper}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(bending down)}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, jasper, virginia. telling the truth can be a scary thing. it scared president kennedy, but he was a brave man. if you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you and then everybody gets scared. jasper virginia stay with mom, daddy... please.}

<D>__{i've been called everything under the sun, jerry. call me whatever you like.}
<A>__{he reads from a script on the desk.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{first we had your charge that the cuban exiles killed the president, then the mob, then you said the oil billionaires did it, then you said the minutemen and the ku klux klan collaborated to do it, now your latest theory seems to be that the cia and the fbi and the pentagon and the white house all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill john kennedy. let me ask you, is there anyone besides lee harvey oswald who you think did not conspire to kill the president?}
<A>__{he fixes his eyes on jim, waiting for a reply. a weariness has set in on jim. once more into the slaughter.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how many hours do i have to answer that one? well let's just say this, jerry i've stopped beating my wife.}
<P>__{(the audience laughs)}

<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{there have been a number of reports in reputable news media time, newsweek, our own nbc that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury. what is your response?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, jerry. it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over. but seriously, jerry, people aren't interested in jim garrison they want the hard evidence! they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...}
<C>__{johnson}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{some people would say you're paranoid.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, if i am, why is the government concealing evidence?}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{are they? why would they?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pulling out his briefcase)}
<D>__{that's exactly my question, jerry. maybe i'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what i am talking about.}
<A>__{he pulls out a large blowup of the allen photo of the three hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{these arrests were photographed minutes after the assassination, and were never shown to the american public. they show...}
<A>__{it takes johnson a few moments to realize what's happening. when he does, he lunges like a cobra for the photographs, pulling jim's arm down so the pictures are out of the camera's view.}

<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{pictures like this don't show up on television!}

<P>__{off)}
<D>__{those men you just saw were arrested in dallas minutes after the assassination. they were never seen again. no record of arrest, no fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing. they all got away.}

<C>__{numa}
<D>__{sure sounds like he's winning.}

<A>__{he waves and leaves the podium, going back through the kitchen of the hotel. jim is frozen in his spot, shaken. the ghost of jack kennedy as he was before the killing stares at him through the kitchen, as if encased in a hologram. the hooded eyes watch jim without expression. they're communicating, in some strange subliminal way. suddenly shots ring out from the television and there's pandemonium.}
