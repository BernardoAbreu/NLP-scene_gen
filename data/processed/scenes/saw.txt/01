<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. because no one is going to believe you later.}

<P>__{(quietly, giving in.) okay.}
<A>__{camera moves into the interrogation room with amanda, tapp, and the unidentified man. as tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards amanda. as we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar like markings along each side of her mouth. she is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including tapp, in the eye. it is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(speaking slowly, gently) amanda...in}
<D>__{your own time, tell me the first thing you remember.}
<A>__{we move closer and closer to amanda, then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, her flashback. the room she is in has the same lime green lighting as pauls cell. amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head, a bear trap like device covering her mouth. we can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(vo) i woke up. all i could taste was}
<D>__{blood. (the camera moves back quickly, and we see her tied to the chair, her wrists bound to the arms of the chair. she pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out but cannot.) and metal.}
<A>__{she continues to struggle against her bonds some more. the camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. a long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen. the view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. after a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented clown like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, its red eyes leering at amanda from the screen. she stares at it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. the doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of jigsaw.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from the tv) hello amanda. you dont}
<D>__{know me, but i know you. i want to play a game. heres what happens if you lose.}
<P>__{(the video moves next to the doll, to}
<D>__{a device like the one shes wearing attached to a mannequin head. as he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.) the device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. when the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. think of it like a reverse bear trap. here, ill show you.}
<A>__{the video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. the dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. a timer ticks away. a few seconds later, snap! the device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. the video switches back to a close up of the doll.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from the tv) there is only one key}
<D>__{to open the device. its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. look around, amanda. know that im not lying. you better hurry up. live or die. make your choice.}
<A>__{the video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair. the camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky. amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly. thats when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. she freezes, her eyes widening. we see a close up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown. she reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there. she starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her. the camera spins back to amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling. we see a brief shot of lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. back to amanda.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{and then i saw the body.}
<A>__{we switch back into amandas cell. over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. she kneels down cautiously next to him. she reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. she sobs harder, hunched over him. quick cut to the interrogation room, amanda in the center of the shot.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{there was a knife.}
<A>__{back to the cell. amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. she slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. she looks closer at it. a quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. the camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when... he opens his eyes and starts to wake up. he moans, unable to speak or move. his eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. he cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. he sees amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. he moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. blood splashes on her hands. a quick shot back of lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. cut back to amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times. then back again to the table in lawrences interrogation room. sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it.}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(vo as camera pans up to lawrence) hed}
<D>__{been injected with an opiate overdose. he couldnt move or feel much of anything.}

<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{what happened after you took it off?}
<A>__{cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key. cut back to interrogation room amanda, then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. back to interrogation room amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell. amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes holding. she reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. the timer ticks away, faster and faster. she gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. she lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. she can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. it stops, leering at her, then speaks.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<D>__{congratulations. you are still alive. most people are so ungrateful to be alive. but not you. not anymore.}
<A>__{cut back into a close up of amanda in the interrogation room, her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight spasms. she continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. cut to tapp.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{you are, in fact, a drug addict. isnt that right, mandy? (she nods, but doesnt look up.) do you think that is why he picked you? (she lets out a sob, briefly nodding once.) are you grateful, mandy?}
<A>__{she finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first time.}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(softly) he...helped me.}
<A>__{as she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, tapp looks over his shoulder into lawrences room, right in his direction. he may not see him, but he knows hes there. the camera then cuts back to amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where lawrence and adam are. adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has been listening to lawrences story. he looks up across to lawrence.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(softly) are you sure its him?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(nods slightly) yeah, im sure.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(becoming a little hysterical again.}

<D>__{wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained foot out. shouts.) wrong! youve got one thing i dont: information! (he hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose, pointing) you know who did this!}
<P>__{(he picks up a glass shard that fell}
<D>__{when he broke the mirror, holds it up threateningly to lawrence) now you either tell me what is really going on (lawrence rolls his eyes, turns his head over to his left, away from adam) or ill cut you with this, you hear me? ill cut (but he stops short as he sees something in the glass. he flips it over, studying it, flips it back. he looks over to the mirror on the wall,}
<P>__{studying it, thinking.)}
<A>__{lawrence notices that adams ranting has ended, glances over at him.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(looks over at lawrence, then back at}
<D>__{the mirror.) its a two way mirror.}
<A>__{adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a loose padlock. he lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. adam reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force. the rest of the glass breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass. lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. we movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of lawrence and adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. the shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. a partial view of other recording type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. a mans voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the jigsaw tapes. as he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.}

<D>__{can you hear me in there? huh? im having a blast. (he bends down and picks up}
<P>__{another piece of debris from the floor)}

<D>__{thats why we cant cut through these chains. its why you wont break that glass. (he gestures to the pipe then the glass) every possible angle has been pre thought out by him.

<D>__{help me find it.}
<A>__{adam does not help him look. he simply cannot believe lawrences calm demeanor in this situation anymore. it seems that he is almost becoming as sick of lawrences attitude as lawrence is of his. he speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly.}

<D>__{how can you be the calm doctor guy when your wife and kid are out there. (shot}
<P>__{of lawrence looking around the room)}

<P>__{(suddenly looks right at him, snaps}
<D>__{angrily) i am thinking about that. (adam backs off a bit. lawrence pauses a moment,}
<P>__{his voice changes to calm but sad.)}
<D>__{ive been the last thing i said to my daughter.}
<A>__{lawrence turns away from adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. the little girl is diana. shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. she lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. the camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. as the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. she sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. she remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. the chimes jingle away. we move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. a clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical looking clock on the living room wall of the gordon household. the shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the gordon home. the walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. it definitely is the living room of a well off family. not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. she moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. she reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{diana, honey, are you okay? (she pushes back the covers and gets up, crouching down in front of her daughter. looking up at her, she places her hands on her daughters arms.) diana, honey, can you hear me?}

<D>__{nope! im done. (he smiles, turning}
<P>__{to look at them.)}

<P>__{(with a small smile) okay.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{okay. (he goes out.)}
<A>__{quick cut to the entrance hall of the gordon residence. lawrence walks towards the door, alison behind him. alisons voice starts to cut over the scene. her tone is very pissed off.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i dont know how much longer i can do this, larry.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(sounds as though he has no idea what}
<D>__{she means) what, what are you talking about?}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(pissed, in disbelief) how can you walk}
<D>__{through life pretending that youre happy?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i am happy.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(confrontational) that is complete bullshit. (cut to a shot of diana, laying on her}
<D>__{side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. her eyes are open, she can hear everything. we stay with her for the rest of alisons line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible) id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. at least thered be some passion in it.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{would you like to see her? (he reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing lawrence. adam picks up the wallet and opens it. he sees two pictures of diana, side by side. the one on the left is diana hugging a dog. the one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{shes beautiful.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sighs, then looks up at lawrence) you}
<D>__{gonna have any more kids?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a bit wearily, but not snobby) weve}
<D>__{talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one. (the tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and}
<P>__{attention to his daughter.)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(referring to the wallet) so wheres the lucky wife? (a small smile)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. (adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) its my favourite one because were all in it together. someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means im always missing from the photos.}
<A>__{cut to adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. his face is blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. cut to a shot of the photo he is holding. it is not the one lawrence described, but a polaroid of alison and diana bound and gagged, and the message regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. he turns the photo over, and there is a message. as he reads it, jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(vo) x marks the spot. sometimes you}
<D>__{see more with your eyes shut.}
<A>__{adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to lawrence.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{its uh, its not here.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a slight disturbance from his momentary}
<D>__{nostalgic bliss) what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{uh, this photo youre talking about...its not here.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(slightly surprised, reaching out his}
<D>__{hand for adam to toss the wallet.) really? are you sure?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah. (tucking the picture in his right hand, he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his left hand. lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while adam backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of lawrences sight against a pipe he rests his arm}
<P>__{on as he looks at the photograph.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(disbelief, shaking his head) he...he}
<D>__{mustve taken it. i...}
<A>__{alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to look through the wallet, and we hear alisons voiceover from the scene in the main hall.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(vo) how can you walk through life pretending}
<D>__{that youre happy?}
