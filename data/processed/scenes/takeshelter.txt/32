<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{curtis gasps for air. it doesn't come. gasp. he's sucking for a breath. hyperventilating. he rises up in bed, gasping. his face flushed and head soaked in sweat. his eyes dart around the room, frantically searching his surroundings. one more gasp, and air enters his lungs. he coughs. more air. long, deep breaths. he's calming down. his breathing comes under control. his attention turns to something else. something under the sheets. curtis pulls back the bed sheets. the mattress is soaked in yellow urine. this scares him. his hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers. the toilet flushes. footsteps in heels. curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. samantha enters the bedroom. she pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to curtis.}
