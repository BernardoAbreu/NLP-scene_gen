<A>__{jimmy is in a grocery store aisle filming judy from way far away. we can barely make out that it is her until jimmy zooms in tighter. she couldn't look more nervous or obvious. she is in the beer section. she quickly takes a six pack of canned beer and struggles to put it in her school bag. she walks quickly towards the exit. jimmy follows her and catches up. jimmy is standing next to her and he continues to film. judy looks so nervous.}

<C>__{store manager}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{jimmy and judy have no reply. the store manager gives them his best intimidating stare. there is an extremely long pause.}
