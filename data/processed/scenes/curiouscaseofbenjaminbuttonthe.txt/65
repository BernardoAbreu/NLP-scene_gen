<A>__{we see benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the kitchen for something to eat... and he slows, seeing queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the kitchen table, peacefully breast feeding her infant... as benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after him...}

<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{goodbye...}
<A>__{and he's gone. benjamin gets up going to the window. he looks outside. he can see mr. oti come onto the porch. there's a full moon. and as he walks off, his arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the gate, benjamin watches him disappear into the night.}
