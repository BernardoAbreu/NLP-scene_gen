<A>__{a terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. pink cheeks, a halo of blonde white hair which will darken in time. what sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at stella through the hedge.}

<D>__{what are those?}
<A>__{stella looks where carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts white against the golden tan. stella adjusts her suit not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.}

<A>__{incredulous. but she senses that carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at the white house just beyond the half grown hedge. she kneels next to carrie and tries to laugh it off.}

<L>__{10. stella}
<A>__{stands there, riveted. not knowing what's happened, what to do. it's utterly silent for a moment. and then, an incredible cacophony of strange sounds starts coming from the white house an unearthly babble as margaret white screams, rants, and screeches; as carrie sobs that she's sorry, that she forgot.}

<D>__{a) the gym as last minute arrangements are made more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.; b) carrie in a town store as she shops for makeup; c) norma watson under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; d) tommy picking out carrie's corsage at the florist; e) carrie at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; f) the gym as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; g) sue having dinner with her parents h) the twins in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; i) ernest the class president making sure the microphone on the stage works; j) the band among them, the beak, setting up; k) sandra stenchfeld, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; l) a door which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed looking dates; m) george and frieda he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as freida's parents take a polaroid of this night to remember; n) the gym with the adult chaperones teachers, administrators standing around, looking for something to do.}

<A>__{on carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.}
<L>__{331 margaret}
<A>__{carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.}
<B>__{margaret}
<A>__{it says in the lord's book: `thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'}
<L>__{332 carrie}
<A>__{dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. she begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{and now the devil has come home.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(whimpering)}
<D>__{momma, it's not right.}
<A>__{carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while. carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut. margaret is coming toward the kitchen. carrie flexes again to hold the door shut. but it's no use margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. she raises the knife and starts toward carrie, the door swinging behind her.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i should have killed you when you were born.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{momma, i love you. please help me!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sin never dies.}
<A>__{there's nothing else to be done. carrie flexes, and a serving fork dangling from a hook on the way suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing margaret. it is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes margaret. margaret collapses. carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother. and then she and we see sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you. you tricked me.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{we were just trying to...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{and then something hits the roof, rattling. a small sound. a stone. then another. then a third.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out! get out!}
<A>__{the stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail. sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out, get out, get out!}
<A>__{the stones are coming down harder. all sound as one or two of them break through the roof, rattle on the floor below.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{a stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen. carrie flexes. and sue stumbles backwards toward the door. flex. sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.}
<L>__{exterior white house night}
<A>__{stones are crashing on the house. sue is hurtled out of the house.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{as a couple of larger stones crash into the room, carrie heads for the closet.}
<L>__{exterior white house night}
<A>__{sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house. she begins to run away.}
<L>__{interior white house night}
<A>__{carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of jesus is illuminated welcoming her? she goes into the closet. she closes the door. stones crash down, obliterating the scene.}
<L>__{exterior white house night}
<A>__{sue stops running. she turns to look at the white house.}
<L>__{338 white house sue's pov}
<A>__{the stones are flattening the house. the house is being pounded into the ground.}
<L>__{339 sue}
<A>__{terror and disbelief. nightmare.}
<L>__{340 the white house}
<A>__{the rain of stones stops. silence. then the house begins to sink slowly, slowly, slowly into the ground. and the ground is swallowing up the house. and covering it until nothing remains. not a trace.}

<L>__{exterior snell house day}
<A>__{some time later a week, perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of prom night.}
<L>__{interior snell house}
<A>__{a home in the course of losing its family. white sheets cover furniture. boxes in the midst of being packed. eleanor snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last minute details of moving. she sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. and she comes across the religious tracts left behind by margaret white, forgotten until now. they have a momentary hypnotic effect on her. the phone rings, startling her. she rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first or second ring.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<P>__{(hushed voice)}
<D>__{hello? oh, thank god it's you, betty. i don't think i could have handled one more reporter.}
<P>__{(she appears to hear a noise upstairs)}
<D>__{just a sec, dear.}
<P>__{(she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs)}
<D>__{sue?}
<P>__{(a little louder)}
<D>__{sue?}
<P>__{(no answer, she returns to the phone)}
<D>__{sorry, betty, i just wanted to make sure the phone didn't wake her. we're all a bit edgy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{better. sleeping too much, i guess, but schneider says that's to be expected after what she's gone through. he says she's young enough to forget it in time. knock wood.}
<A>__{as eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. half of her is listening and talking to betty; the rest of her mind is on sue upstairs. with good reason. because:}
<L>__{exterior empty lot day}
<A>__{where the horan house used to stand, now vacant. strewn with beer cans, overgrown with grass and weeds and wildflowers. and a for sale sign. we pan over next door where the white house used to stand. it, too, is vacant but utterly bald there's been no time for anything to grow here. there is another for sale sign put up by born realty.}
<L>__{344 sue snell}
<A>__{looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring at the lot. she's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.}
<L>__{345 the white lot sue's pov}
<A>__{as she slowly walks toward it. underwater, almost floating. we come closer on the sign which now starts appearing a bit odder less like a simple for sale sign and more like a grave marker. and when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk on the sign:}
<B>__{carrie white is burning in hell for her sins}
<A>__{and below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:}
<B>__{jesus never fails}
<L>__{346 sue}
<A>__{as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. she proceeds to try to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly. she stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering carrie in the shower. suddenly, a second hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown. a bloody hand. a hand from the earth itself. carrie's hand it clutches a horrified sue by the wrist. tightly. a vice. sue begins screaming uncontrollably. the hand is trying to pull her into the ground. her screams turn into howling.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{347 sue}
<A>__{still screaming. but now in her room, waking from what is, indeed, a bad nightmare. upright in bed, screaming her head off, her face covered with perspiration. eleanor snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her hysterical daughter.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{it's all right, it's all right, darling.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{mother?}
<A>__{and we come in close on sue's stricken face as her mother holds her, calming her, cradling her. closer still on sue's eyes. she closes them, and we go to:}
