<D>__{not working! big close up!}
<A>__{jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to get his robe.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{okay! good night!}
<A>__{jake spins the laptop and the isight lens lands on jane. jane and adam look at one another. no time to say anything. she's desperate. he's lost. the door flies open, the kids rush in, just as jake ties his robe.}

<D>__{everybody okay?}
<A>__{no one says anything.}
<C>__{lauren}

<A>__{gabby breaks down in tears. lauren puts her arm around her. jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she hears a click and the laptop screen goes black.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why's everyone crying? why isn't this good news?}
<C>__{lauren}
