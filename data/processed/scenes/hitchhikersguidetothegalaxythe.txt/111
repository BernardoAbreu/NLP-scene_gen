<L>__{exterior temple of deep thought moments later}
<A>__{ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a cobblestone street. zaphod's body falls to the ground next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright beside them. trillian is already heading down the street toward the temple. ford and zaphod hurry to catch up to her.}
<L>__{exterior rock formation day}
<A>__{arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset. he looks over and sees the two mice from the ship scurrying toward one of the giant stone doors. they slip through a crack beneath the stone. a flash of light bursts through the crack. arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{don't talk to me about life.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{here i am, god knows how far from home...}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{don't talk to me about god.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{...and this is where i see the most spectacular sunset i've ever laid eyes on. we only had the one sun at home. planet called earth.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i know. you keep going on about it. it sounds awful.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh no, it's beautiful. or at least, it was...}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{did it have oceans?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes. great wide rolling blue oceans.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{can't bear oceans.}
<A>__{arthur looks up at marvin.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so this is how it will all end, then? me, on a dead planet with a manically depressed robot.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{you think you've got problems? what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? no, don't bother to answer that, i'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even i don't know the answer. it gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{arthur spins to see an old, bearded man in long robes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{aah!}
<A>__{he jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{my name is not important.}
<A>__{arthur continues to scramble away from the man.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{you must come with me. terrible events are afoot. you must come or you'll be late.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{late? what for?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{what is your name, earthman?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{dent. arthur dent.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{late as in "the late dentarthurdent." it's a sort of threat you see. never been much good at them myself, but i'm told they can be terribly effective.}
<A>__{he motions to the stone that is marked "to showroom."}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{your friends are safe. you can trust me.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{trust a man who won't tell me his name?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{my name? very well...}
<P>__{(heaves a sigh, reluctant)}
<D>__{my name is...slartibartfast.}
<A>__{arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{i said it wasn't important.}
<A>__{slartibartfast motions to the door. he looks to marvin.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i could calculate your chances of survival but you won't like it.}
<A>__{arthur rises, cautiously moves over to slarti's side.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{i must warn you. we are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. it may disturb you. it scares the willies out of me.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses. the stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex. slarti motions after you. arthur takes a deep breath and steps in.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{whaa!}
<A>__{he is bent, twisted and sucked away. slarti follows. marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to... the sky where the fleet of vogon ships has now arrived.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.}
