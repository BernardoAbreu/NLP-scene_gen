<L>__{exterior sans souci parking lot day}
<A>__{kenny and bobby stand by their car off to one side of the restaurant's parking lot. bobby's secret service agents maintain a discreet distance.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{if we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast. this is only getting out of control. the only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules. he won't be able to keep it up forever.}
<A>__{bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth. a beat. kenny looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{the jupiters are obsolete. they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway }
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{ jesus, mary and joseph. i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article! but you wouldn't listen to me. what if there hasn't been a coup at all? what if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?}
<A>__{bobby is speechless with rage.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{and if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole, you're so wrong. it's a deuce.}
<A>__{bobby's beyond furious. they catch their rising voices.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{and it's not just me who thinks that. everyone on this so called excom is telling you exactly the same thing: make the trade, and they're going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won't trade like berlin, and we do end up in a war.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not to mention, that long before that happens, this government will be politically dead.}
<A>__{bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking. and boy, does this guy hate admitting he's wrong.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{all right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. okay? you happy? so now what?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{so now you've got to talk him out of it. and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?}
<A>__{kenny stares off at the city, agonized.}
