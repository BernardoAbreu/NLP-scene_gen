<L>__{exterior paradise day}
<A>__{soft waves lap against a pristine beach. palm trees sway in the warm breeze. a steady whirring is the only sound that disturbs the serenity. is it a lawn mower? a leaf blower? there's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this idyllic scene. the swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical caribbean sunlight. and stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none other than kristen richards, soaking up rays. at her side is a paper shredder, and between sips from a pina colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped black widow evidence in red ink... kristen looks over at elena, equally stunning in a matching bikini.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{i can't believe morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker...}
<A>__{a broad grin stretches across her lips as elena empties the contents of a velvet pouch onto a table. the mother daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{these are...genuine?}
<A>__{elena nods.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{nothin' like the real thing. switched 'em for the fakes right after marie tried to pay me off...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{they're...so beautiful.}
<A>__{elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to kristen.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{the mother.}
<A>__{kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to elena.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{the daughter.}
