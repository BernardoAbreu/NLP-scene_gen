<L>__{exterior desert day}
<D>__{abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. the police have stopped firing and run for cover. yussef loads the rifle again and aims carefully. he shoots and, in the distance, we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter. abdullah shouts at yussef desperately.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{yussef, stop shooting! furious, yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at the cops. ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. confused, abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son or stop the enraged yussef. in the distance, the cops reorganize. we hear the faraway shots of alarid giving orders.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{move that truck... god damn it... one of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet. yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well covered. abdullah drags himself all the way to yussef.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{give me that rifle...}
<A>__{yussef turns to his father.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{they're going to kill us.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{give me that rifle.}
<A>__{he tries to wrest it away, but yussef resists. the struggle and abdullah finally pulls it away. when yussef tries to snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two barely have time to hide. the air is thick with gunshots. yussef and abdullah, terrified, stick to the stones. the bullets strike very close to them, and they can't even raise their heads. ahmed won't stop complaining. abdullah shouts at him.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{ahmed, don't move.}
<A>__{the gunshots rain down for over a minute. when they stop, abdullah turns to look at ahmed, who is lying motionless on the rocks with bullet in his back.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{ahmed! ahmed!}
<A>__{oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him. motionless, ahmed just moans. with every breath, his shirt grows bloodier.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{ahmed! ahmed!}
<A>__{he rolls ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. abdullah cannot stop crying. yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother. abdullah laments nervously.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{don't die, don't die.}
<A>__{yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. he stands up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not, he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks. when he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks toward the police. one of them policemen looks at him through a pair of binoculars. alarid interrogates him.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{a boy is walking this way.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{is he armed?}
<A>__{the officer takes a careful look.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{it doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{what are the others doing?}
<A>__{the officer watches abdullah carrying his wounded son.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{a man is holding somebody injured.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{is the other one still walking this way?}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{alarid turns to the other officers.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{aim.}
<A>__{the police aim and hold yussef in their sights. he keeps walking resolutely toward his aggressors. he is crying softly, keeping his arms open. yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and he kneels with his arms open.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{i killed the american, i was the only one who shot at you...}
<A>__{cautious, the police still aim at his chest. yussef proceeds with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{they did nothing... nothing...}
<A>__{he turns to his father and his brother and points at them.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{kill me, but save my brother, he did nothing... nothing...}
<A>__{alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle. behind him are five other cops, also ready to shoot.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{on the ground... yussef does not obey.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{save my brother...}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{on the ground... yussef turns his face toward alarid looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{save my brother... please... he lies on the floor, crying. alarid puts his gun down and looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. then he looks up at abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. he turns to one of his subordinates.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{go help them. one of the officers goes to help abdullah and ahmed. yussef lies on the floor, crying.}
