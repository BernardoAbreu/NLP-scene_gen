<A>__{...the theory of black holes was developed before there was any indication from observations that they actually existed. i do not know of any other example in science where such a great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis of thought. it shows the remarkable power and depth of einstein's theory. there is still much we don't know, such as what happens to objects and information that fall into a black hole. do the reemerge elsewhere in the universe, or in another universe? and can we warp space and time so much that one can travel back in time? maybe someone will come back from the future and tell us.}
