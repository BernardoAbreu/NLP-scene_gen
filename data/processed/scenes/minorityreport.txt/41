<L>__{interior precrime headquarters day}
<A>__{ed witwer sits alone in an antechamber. he stares at an oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor. he runs both hands through his hair. he is tired, his eyes weary, lost. a voice comes over the intercom.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{enter now please, assistant director witwer.}
<A>__{witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.}
<L>__{interior a conference room}
<A>__{witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table. powerful men sit at the other end of the table. swanson, sharp boned, the fbi director. cronin, awl like eyes, the cia director. senator malcolm. chief justice pollard, whose face reveals nothing. vice president almer, whose tongue darts across his dry lips unsettlingly. unpleasant looking men in an unpleasant mood. cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares at witwer.}
<C>__{cia cronin}
<D>__{the central question is: why does anderson want to kill witwer?}
<A>__{cronin holds up the printout.}
<C>__{cia cronin }
<D>__{we checked your finances. his finances. nothing irregular, you don't steal from him, he doesn't steal from you. you haven't done anything that he might have discovered, and vice versa.}
<A>__{swanson holds up another sheath of papers.}
<C>__{fbi swanson}
<D>__{personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's done nothing to you, or you to him.}
<A>__{witwer presses his lips together.}
<D>__{vice president almer you fucking his wife?}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fbi swanson}
<D>__{his mother? his brother?}
<A>__{witwer gives him a bad look.}
<C>__{fbi swanson }
<D>__{okay. there we are.}
<C>__{justice pollard}
<D>__{so, you are friends, partners, and soul mates. anderson has no motive.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i can't think of one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe justice pollard the precogs are mistaken?}
<A>__{witwer looks away. jesus, he wants out of this room.}
<C>__{justice pollard}
<D>__{you don't believe that, do you?}
<C>__{witwer}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{no. the precogs are infallible.}
<A>__{senator malcolm is impatient with all this.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{you're goddam right. so, gentlemen screw the motive. we got a pre murderer on the run, and a nasty little pr problem.}
<A>__{the very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on witwer.}
<D>__{vice president almer and here is our solution. you are now director witwer.}
<A>__{witwer shakes his head, starts to protest. almer silences him with a raised finger.}
<P>__{vice president almer (cont'd)}
<D>__{precrime must demonstrate its willingness to go after one of its own. total impartiality.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{now look}
<A>__{cronin talks right over him.}
<C>__{cia cronin}
<D>__{the public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor.}
<C>__{fbi swanson}
<D>__{therefore, precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job. and who would pursue a murderer harder ... than his intended victim?}
<C>__{justice pollard}
<D>__{you went after anderson yesterday because it was right, and because you believe.}
<A>__{almer speaks with a tight irony.}
<D>__{vice president almer and your belief will certainly grow stronger with each tick of the clock.}
<A>__{witwer looks at the men with thinly veiled hatred. but he does not deny their words.}
<C>__{justice pollard}
<D>__{haw long will it take, director?}
<A>__{wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the task he can't avoid.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{he knows precrime, of course. and the streets he's rusty, but he'll remember how to work them. it'll come back to him fast. he's ... the best.}
<A>__{witwer almost smiles. justice pollard's not smiling.}
<C>__{justice pollard}
<D>__{we're not here to praise caesar we're here to bury him.}
<A>__{witwer looks at pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his right eye.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{he can't avoid iris identification. every door he opens, every atm he uses, or taxi or transport he boards he'll get scanned.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it won't take long to find him.}
<A>__{the eyes that look back at witwer are unblinking.}
