<A>__{julian moves towards the middle where chang is already waiting. julian waits for chang this time. chang is reluctant to attack. a waiting game... who will strike first... chang wins. julian moves to kick chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as he moves in. chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own kick as it comes in. chang steps back, but again julian swivels, using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot. chang goes flying backwards. pick out the look of concern etched on the faces of nadee and kanita. chang recovers but julian moves in fast with a series of punches and elbows. chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten. he clings on to julian to limit the damage.}

<A>__{the two fighters step back from each other. chang's face is damaged. juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds. end of the second round. round three: julian slamming punches into chang. nadee comforting kanita. telling her it'll be okay. chang responding with kicks and elbows. defensive blocks and counter attacks. mai willing julian on. jenna watching with gordon... end of round: julian feeling more confident. again his eyes scan the crowd. this time he sees what he's looking for: jenna. chang eyeballs julian from the other corner. sees him staring into the crowd. looks over. tries to see what he's looking at but can't make it out. pov from chang as he sees jenna make her way toward julian. when she gets to him we see her saying something to julian about the fight urging him to hit harder... jenna then walks back to gordon... on chang. deep in thought. he gets up early. walks around the ring. looking into the crowd. jenna sees him. stares at him. suddenly nervous. everything slows down as chang clocks her again. the colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red. he's seen her and she knows she's been seen. and he knows. and she knows that he knows... the bell goes off. back to reality. chang turns round. too late. he gets a massive blow to his head. he goes down hard. the referee starts counting. nadee and kanita watch on, fearful. jenna holds her breath. hopeful that he might be down and out. kim watches on, concerned.}

<A>__{after a long, terrible pause... chang gets up. he looks over into the crowd. makes eye contact with his wife. it's okay. she shakes her head. she can't bear it. tears running down her face. back on his feet, chang suddenly drops his guard. julian hesitates, confused. chang leans in close to him. winks.}

<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<A>__{chang raises his arms again. ready to fight. julian gets ready to attack but something's changed. the fire's gone out of him. he looks over to his mother, to mai, chang's words echoing in his mind. it's not his fault. then chang comes in with a flurry of punches. left, right, left, right. julian just takes them... chang pauses in the onslaught. julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring. chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick which makes contact with julian's draw. slow motion as julian's head takes the impact. he's out cold before he hits the floor.}
