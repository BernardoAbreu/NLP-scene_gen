<L>__{exterior cloister la rabida day}
<A>__{along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry in the light breeze. columbus pins up a new addition. another monk works nearby, in silence.}
<C>__{pinzon }
<D>__{senor colon?}
<A>__{columbus turns, to see a small, stocky man approaching: a middle class gentleman. he nods.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{ah, thank god! i've been looking all over seville for you! never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh?}
<A>__{he laughs. columbus smiles, but doesn't say anything. pinzon is clearly a little surprised.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{name's pinzon, by the way. martin alonzo pinzon. i'm a ship owner from palos...}
<A>__{columbus glances around cautiously, and walks a little way down the cloister, away from the other monk, gesturing for pinzon to follow him. pinzon is yet more surprised by this strange behavior.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<P>__{(indicating the monk)}
<D>__{is he a spy?}
<A>__{columbus shakes his head. pinzon stares at him, perplexed.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{what is it? are you a trappist?}
<A>__{columbus shakes his head again.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{vow of silence...? penance?}
<A>__{columbus nods vigorously.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{jesus! just my luck!}
<A>__{he takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk cloth.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{listen. i will do the talking for both of us. you just nod. agreed? just as i do with the wife.}
<A>__{columbus nods.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{i know that the commission turned you down, right? what do you expect? you're a foreigner... but i want to help you.}
<A>__{columbus gives him a glance like one throws a question in the air.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{you wonder why i believe in you? hey, i am a seaman. and we don't like to be told where to go, and where not to go.}
<A>__{columbus looks at him, and bursts out laughing. the other monk looks round severely. columbus ducks behind a map, pinzon following him. pinzon lowers his voice.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{i don't look like it, but i have friends at the court. the treasurer of aragon, for example. he finances me. his name's santangel. ever heard of him?}
<A>__{columbus shakes his head, but looks increasingly interested by what he's hearing.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{he can get you an audience with the queen! you know why...? she owes him money. that's how it is. you me the queen the world and his mistress agreed?}
<A>__{columbus nods.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{so. what do you say?}
<A>__{columbus looks around, catches the disapproving face of the monk, crosses himself, then speaks:}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{where can i meet this man?}
<C>__{pinzon}
<P>__{(indicating with a nod)}
<D>__{immediately.}
<A>__{columbus turns and sees an elegant lord in his fifties, examining the maps.}
