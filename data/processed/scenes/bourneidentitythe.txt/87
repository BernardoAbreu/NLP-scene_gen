<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{marie taking it in fast. bourne seems paralyzed. trying to soak it all in. willing himself home. touching things as he passes. as if a texture, a smell something will become familiar. he's deep into this as we go to }
<B>__{the bedroom}
<A>__{marie in the doorway. checking it out. it's so clean and simple. but it's not the decor she's most interested in... marie opening an armoire... nothing but men's clothes. no competition. she's feeling better by the moment as we go to }
<B>__{the kitchen}
<A>__{like a stage set. lots of props and no sign of food. bourne picking up a frying pan.}

<A>__{marie backs out. bourne alone again. standing there for a moment. dealing with it. and then he sits down in a chair. bourne sitting there. staring. the room, the desk it's all so devoid of personality. and then, something catches his eye and insert the desk top a faint silhouette through the dust and grime. outlines of where a computer used to sit. bourne reaching suddenly under the desk. bingo. pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray. but it's empty. no keyboard. now he's really confused and insert a phone answering machine bourne pressing the playback button and }
