<D>__{they'll put her in jail. the damn little fool might as well be naked.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(a wee mite worried)}
<D>__{well, it is a little tight. but it isn't as bad as all that. no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{who doesn't have such thoughts?}
