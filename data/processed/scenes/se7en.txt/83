<L>__{exterior city street, catholic church afternoon}
<A>__{a tall church on a bustling street. smoggy air has eaten at the stonework. the homeless are camped out on the stairs.}
<L>__{interior catholic church, priest's quarters afternoon}
<A>__{the priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable. the parish's wealth is evident. father bleeker, 38, stands looking at several 8" by 10" glossies. he's dressed in his "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper. these photos are making him heartsick. bleeker hands them to somerset who is seated by a fireplace.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{put them away. i wish you hadn't brought them into the church.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i needed for you to see them.}
<A>__{father bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget the images. somerset replaces the murder photos in a file.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{there were five principal phases in the development of early christian art. from hellenistic through the renaissance... each period was affected by the decrees of religious leaders.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{if this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church... if he collects religious art from a certain period, i want to know. i have to narrow it down.}
<A>__{bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet. he puts on a pair of cotton gloves.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{the influences on these... things he's done, couldn't have come before the gothic period. what's in those pictures is presented far too asymmetrically.}
<A>__{bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet. he takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth.}
<C>__{bleeker }
<D>__{the colors will tell the tale.}
<A>__{bleeker takes the book to a table. somerset follows. bleeker lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly.}
<C>__{bleeker }
<D>__{each sin had a symbolic color. but the specific color designations changed throughout the ages.}
<A>__{somerset leans to examine bleeker's illuminated manuscript: two pages of prayer. the prose is elaborately formed, surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins. bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a rock, guzzling from a jug. it's been painted in orange.}
<P>__{bleeker (o.s.,cont)}
<D>__{this is an example. gluttony is the sin, and the color is orange. this particular manuscript is preserved from the 18th century.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{in the murders, gluttony is green. greed is yellow. sloth is indigo.}
<A>__{bleeker steps away and somerset gets closer to the pages.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{so, if this murderer is as precise as you say, then you need to find out at what period in history was gluttony green... and so on.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{where do i look? if the colors changed so often?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<P>__{(contemplates)}
<D>__{there is one man... father stone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i haven't heard from him for quite some time. this was his passion. he spent his life studying the sins... and preaching against them.}
