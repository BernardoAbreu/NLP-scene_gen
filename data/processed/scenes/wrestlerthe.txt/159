<A>__{angle on take a number sign. it reads now serving: 54 a crowd of aggravated customers stand waiting at the counter. a fat guy in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow customer a "do you believe these morons?" eye roll. behind the counter are randy and a coworker. randy is putting a block of havarti onto the slicer. he moves lackadaisically, distractedly. wayne, noticing as he roams past, heads over.}

<D>__{let's pick it up. rush hour.}

<A>__{while we're young... any year now... randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. he gets in a nice, meditative groove. slice, slice, slice, slice, slice... he watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade. he stares at his thumb. at the blade. his thumb. he jams his thumb into the blade. blood squirts everywhere. on his coat. on the deli meat. randy stares at the deep gash, watching as blood pulses out in crimson surges. he smiles strangely at it. a customer gasps. a commotion quickly spreads.}

<A>__{randy roughly shoves him away. wayne stumbles backwards. randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his face. he dramatically smears the blood across his mouth. customers gasp. a woman shrieks. randy drags the gash across his cheek. he smears a line of it under each eye like warpainterior}
