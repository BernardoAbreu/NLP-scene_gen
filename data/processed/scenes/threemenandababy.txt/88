<A>__{michael exits the building. mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms. michael is also carry ing his plastic bag. graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{okay, he's coming out alone. i will follow him. someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys.}
<L>__{exterior central park day}
<A>__{michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with mary on her blanket near him. graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the corner of his eye. michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby. the punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl. he strolls by casually. he spots michael and their eyes meet. the couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin "making out." michael leans over mary, coochie coos her and surrepti tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside him. he puts the clean diaper on her. graton, nervous and wary, watches michael and the passersby. just then, two punks (peter and jack) come running up to michael. he ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic bag and gives it to them. the two punks immediately take off with the package. graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around. michael quickly gets up, picks mary up and discreetly deposits the dope filled diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an intent look. then he goes off in the direction of the cops. the punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction. the cops have meanwhile arrested peter and jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever. michael now joins them.}

<D>__{holy shit! the diaper!}
<A>__{graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. he rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where michael had been lying. suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic.}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{the goddam diaper! what a jerk, what a goddam schmuck i am!}
