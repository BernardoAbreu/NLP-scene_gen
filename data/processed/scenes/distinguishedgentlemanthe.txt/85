<D>__{...and in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred thousand. um...am i losing you on these mortality rates?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{no, i was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? i mean, didn't the merton act cover most of this?}
<C>__{celia}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hmmm, that's an excellent pointerior let me see something...}
<A>__{as she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we track around to a computer screen on tommy's desk it displays the exact words he's just spoken.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{wow...you're right. maybe we can get them to amend merton simmons.}
<A>__{rack focus...reveals reinhardt in b.g., sitting at another computer terminal. he is typing in tommy's responses, which appear on tommy's screen.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{well, for merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod.}
<A>__{in b.g., reinhardt dives forward to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo. celia looks puzzled.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{common cold.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<A>__{celia is startled. tommy is embarrassed...the dumb compliment he's just spoken was one reinhardt typed on the computer screen.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{oh come on...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're right. sorry. excuse me a second.}
