<L>__{exterior milo & alice's house morning}
<A>__{milo comes up the path. he pauses as he nears the door: he's not sure he can pull this off.}
<L>__{interior house continuous}
<A>__{as milo enters, alice rushes to meet him.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's almost nine, i've been so worried!}
<P>__{(she takes his hands)}
<D>__{what did you see in there?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{nothing?}
<A>__{she watches him as he collapses onto the couch.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's what they said it is. an unfinished broadcast studio. you were right... i just drove to seattle and back.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{...why?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{remember lyle barton?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{the justice department guy who came to the apartment when }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i remember.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{after i broke into 21 which was insane, thank god they didn't catch me! i just drove around. trying to figure out what possessed me. you know what? i've been putting my own guilt on gary.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{guilt?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{if i'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{poor baby. you know that's not true.}
<A>__{she sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. he closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch. then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers. but he can't stand it. he gets up, looks out the window.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i thought, instead of indulging all these paranoid delusions, risking my job, alienating gary, scaring you, i should do something useful with my grief. help them find teddy's killers.}
<A>__{he doesn't see her smile: is that all. assuming an appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i was so worried about you.}
<A>__{she turns him around, kisses him. her eyes are closed. his remain open. he's looking at her. trying to comprehend the treachery. she touches him, breathes heavily. she wants more than kisses: to prove to herself how wrong phil was, her professional pride insulted. or perhaps it's more personal than that, especially with lisa as a potential rival.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(through their kisses)}
<D>__{...been such a long night.}
<A>__{but she doesn't stop. she moans as she presses herself to him: wants proof of his devotion.}
