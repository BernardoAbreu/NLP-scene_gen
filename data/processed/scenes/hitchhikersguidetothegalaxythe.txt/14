<L>__{exterior street outside the pub mid day}
<A>__{arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being bulldozed. ford strides casually behind in the distance.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{stop! stop, you bastards!!}
<A>__{arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we hear the loudest rumble in motion picture history. a gigantic yellow spaceship (picture a concrete tower block)) sweeps overhead. ford hits the deck. arthur is blown sideways. trees are uprooted. ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was arthur's house. he digs around near the exposed toilet and comes up with a towel. he hurries to arthur's side. another ship screams over, blowing them down again. rain is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big thwump! everywhere is soaked.}
<D>__{arthur (cont'd} what the hell are those things?!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{ships from a vogon constructor fleet. i picked up their signal this morning.}
<A>__{he shows arthur his blinking sens 0 matic device.}
<D>__{ford {cont'd} here. you'll need this.}
<A>__{he tosses arthur the towel. then, he removes a short black rod, his electronic thumb. he sticks it out.}
