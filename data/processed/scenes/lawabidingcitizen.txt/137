<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{the door opens, revealing nick, cantrell, et al. they come into the room...actually, "room" undersells it. it's the most spectacular suite known to man huge open floor plan, with a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{nice?}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{i'm actually a little jealous clyde didn't pick me.}
<A>__{cantrell laughs and it lightens everybody's mood. nick drifts to the windows, gazing out, as:}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{it's the presidential suite. last person who stayed here was actually a president. of a country. security here is amazing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's not bad, jonas. i think you can muddle through.}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{you're muddling with him. i don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. you need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs.}

<D>__{no shit. this is quite a list. over forty locations?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's not even complete. sarah was in the middle of it untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. she's the expert on all that.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{fellas... i'm grateful for all your efforts. i just wanted to say it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{save it for tonight. hope you're in the mood for chinese takeout.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that stuff in your house it's all gone too far. i started this. i owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it.}
