<L>__{exterior intersection that moment evening}
<A>__{as the van roars past, a mounted policeman shakes his fist. his horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. he's just about gotten the beast calmed down when a man in a stocking mask plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands directly behind him on the horse's back. bruce elbows the startled cop. now there's only one rider. the van turns left. bruce gallops straight ahead through the intersection, hoping to cut the joker off.}
