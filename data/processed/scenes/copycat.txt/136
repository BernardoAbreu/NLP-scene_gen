<D>__{sergeant halloran is it? i've got a list of daryll lee's correspondents. there is a peter kurten among them. daryll lee claims he has information about kurten, but he'll only talk to dr. hudson personally. nobody else. the creep's been studying his amendments. my guess is he doesn't have zip. just angling for a chance to ask if her bra size is still the same. we get this shit all the time, but it's her call.}
