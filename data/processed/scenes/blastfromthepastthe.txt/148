<L>__{exterior venice beach later, same day}
<A>__{there is a most unusual band shell location on the beach that is completely covered by graffiti. eve and troy sit at one of the many stone tables watching adam skate all over the place. he wears spandex workout pants and a t shirt. the starting crane shot begins on the nearly deserted commercial section of venice beach and then takes us to the band shell. angle closer of him skating and them watching.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{he's going to kill himself.}
<P>__{(then, to adam)}
<D>__{go skate out on the bike path! it's that way!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{he heads out of the band shell. we follow him as he skates into an area that has been given over to the homeless. they sit around in their sleeping bags and blankets and cheer (and jeer) adam when he passes by. he takes them to be more mutants.}
