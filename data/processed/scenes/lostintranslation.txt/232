<A>__{bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw charlotte. the street is crowded with japanese people, and different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light rain). music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some promo going on with girls handing out little cologne samples. bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, and super tan japanese kids. in the distance an umbrella moves to reveal charlotte.}
