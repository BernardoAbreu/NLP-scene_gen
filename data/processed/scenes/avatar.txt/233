<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior well of souls night}
<A>__{the cook fires of the battle camp flicker like a constellation around the edge of the well of souls as jake slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater. he moves to the mother tree gnarled, ancient, majestic. the roots spread in all directions, like the center of the world. jake steps forward. the willow like tendrils sway toward him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i've never done this in my life.}
<A>__{he squats at the base of the tree.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and i'm probably just talking to a tree right now. but if you're there i need to give you a heads up.}
<A>__{he looks up into the tree. the hanging tendrils undulate softly. it's easy to imagine a presence.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{if grace is there with you look in her memories she can show you the world we come from. there's no green there. they killed their mother, and they're gonna do the same thing here.}
<A>__{from up in the tree, looking down. woodsprites float in silence, moving around aimlessly.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{more sky people are gonna come. they're gonna come like a rain that never ends }
<A>__{neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ until they've covered the world. unless we stop them.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{look, you chose me for somethin'. and i will stand and fight, you know i will. but i could use a little help here.}
<A>__{jake senses neytiri and turns.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{our great mother does not take sides. she protects only the balance of life.}
<A>__{she comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it was worth a try.}
<A>__{they lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together. holding each other in this, the last moment of peace.}
