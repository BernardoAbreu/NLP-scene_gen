<A>__{the deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that passes behind her. the shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by a slight scraping. freddy's glove materializes, raking the knives along the metal cross bars. freddy stops at stormie's cell, looking inside. stormie is fast asleep. freddy walks into stormie's cell, passing right through the bars. suddenly, stormie wakes and, seeing freddy, jumps to her feet and screams.}

<D>__{help! help! freddy's here! he's here!}
<A>__{but the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and licking her meaty fingers clean. freddy puts his forefinger knife to his lips and shushes stormie, pointing to her cot. stormie looks over and sees her self asleep.}
