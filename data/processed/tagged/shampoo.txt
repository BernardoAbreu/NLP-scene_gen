<A>__{at the shop on brighton way in beverly hills. a few bars of simon and garfunkel's "sounds of silence" covers george pulling up on his bike. the street is empty of traffic except there are scores and scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some meter maids. george starts toward the shop. a pair of women in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop. they look like medusas. they hurtle down the sidewalk as if they're running from something. then they find their respective cars and begin pouring pennies into the meters. clink, buzz, clink, buzz. george looks glum. he's walking along the street. a girl stops him. she's driving by in a 3.4 jag.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hi, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, baby, what's happening?}

<C>__{jill}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{when i get off work.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will call you.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{nothing, i will call you, okay?}
<C>__{jill}

<D>__{i hope she's all right.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she's fine. you really think i'd be a good investment?}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{i wouldn't say so if i didn't.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, i know.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{and i certainly wouldn't tell lester.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{i mean it or i wouldn't say it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's great. you look great, baby, great. dennis, look at felicia's hair.}
<A>__{dennis stops. he's with the desk girl. both of them:}
<D>__{dennis & desk girl great.}
<L>__{exterior shop day}
<A>__{jill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car... gets in... sits for a long moment.}
<L>__{exterior office building day}
<A>__{george on bike pulls into office building. the music over is jefferson airplane's "white rabbit."}
<L>__{interior lester's office day}
<A>__{in his inner office. lester's on the telephone, staring out the window.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{look, kurt, i don't care where you have to go. i want beluga caviar there. call jurgenson's, call chasen's... i don't care how much it costs... how much?... then spend it. just make sure it's there. you've got all the money in the world to buy it. you understand? just make sure it's there on the table tonight.}
<P>__{(he hangs up)}
<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(to george, to no one)}
<D>__{you've got to do everything yourself. you know?}
<A>__{suddenly lester gives george a steely look. it covers his hair, his clothes. george is acutely uncomfortable.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{she says you're a fabulous hairdresser.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i didn't say it, she did. how'd you happen to get in that line of work?}
<A>__{george sort of knows what lester's driving at.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, well, i went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{long pause. george hasn't told lester what he wants to know.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{it's an unusual trade.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<A>__{an awkward pause.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but the important thing is you're successful at it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{in a way. but...}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm better than the guy i work for.}
<A>__{this seems to interest lester.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{after a while that hurts... doesn't it?}
<A>__{lester smiles. he appreciates this.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{it's good you want to do something, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they're not?}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(suddenly direct, almost enthusiastic)}
<D>__{no, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. it's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am i right or am i right?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{who needs that kind of aggravation? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? when i finish work i want to...}
<A>__{the door bursts open. it's one of the secretaries.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{mr. karpf...}
<A>__{jackie is right behind her. she bounces in, not seeing george.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm sorry but i need an extra garage key.}
<A>__{in lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she did with jill. she's startled when she sees george.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what for? what do you need the key for?}
<A>__{jackie continues to stare at george.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the man from sloan's is coming. i called you about it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{how did you lose that key? oh, george, this is uh miss this is jackie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, hi, i mean hello, we've met.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(a little suspiciously)}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(almost immediately on the defensive)}
<D>__{well, yes, george is a wonderful hairdresser.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{awkward pause.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so how's norman?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great. who's been doing your hair?}
<A>__{jackie glances at lester.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood. the guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{george is going to open a shop.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(really interested)}
<D>__{no kidding? your own shop?}
<A>__{george starts to say yes.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{george, could you excuse us for a minute?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving jackie and lester alone. lester shuts the door.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i am?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{who were you talking to?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who do you think i was talking to?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{my secretary saw you with that boy.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{steve?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{whatever his name is, that actor.}
<A>__{jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very emotional.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{steve slutes, and he's not a boy.}
<P>__{(a touch bitter)}
<D>__{steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. he couldn't get arrested as a boy.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{then you were talking to him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica, what was i supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? yes, i was talking to him.}
<A>__{lester's a little chagrined now but not much.}
<C>__{jackie }
<P>__{(an outburst)}
<D>__{i'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, i can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. you're driving me up the wall, lester. you're even jealous of the dogs. i mean i've gotta have somebody i can talk to.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm not jealous of the dogs.}
<A>__{jackie looks at him in disgust.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(very positive)}
<D>__{now listen, jackie, i'm not jealous of anybody, i just can't afford to get caught... off base.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so i can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, i'm going to tell him i'm screwing lester karpf!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's not very logical, lester.}
<L>__{interior office george and secretary}
<A>__{picking up the tail end of this.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he thinks the room is soundproofed. don't tell him it's not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he'll have that awful construction crew back again, and they can never do anything right.}
<L>__{interior lester's office}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(trying to think of why)}
<D>__{it's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. you wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...}

<D>__{shhh }
<P>__{(with genuine awe)}
<D>__{ now that's what i call fucking.}
<A>__{pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window. as he does, a light begins to flood the room. it is the refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end table to another end table and to the refrigerator. it opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of george and jackie.}
<B>__{lester}
<A>__{who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him. his face freezes. it is harsh and determined. he turns slowly away from the window and walks past jill without looking at her.}

<D>__{ what }
<A>__{she turns to the window and sees george and jackie herself.}
<C>__{jill }

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{an ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the wall, and jill can be seen now storming off with pope. george, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far window, pulls it open.}

<D>__{jill! jill! jill, goddammit!}
<A>__{he's got the pants on backwards. he turns back to jackie who has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose into a purse.}

<D>__{... wait here, honey }

<D>__{jill, honey?}
<A>__{inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare teeth of a huge german sheperd growl at him viciously. george chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the house. he trips and falls.}

<D>__{she just went out the door, man.}
<A>__{george charges out the door in time to see the red porsche's taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it purrs off into the night. george turns and runs back into the house and through the strobe lighting living room.}
<B>__{at the poolhouse}

<A>__{george on his motorbike, covered by a few bars of buffalo springfield's 'for what it's worth,' has thrown on a peacoat but kept on his velvet trousers. he's riding up what should now be a familiar road to jill's. the lights from the city below flash in and out of view. jill's garage george pulls in. her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the oil slick stares at him. there's the sound of a car coming down the road. he looks up expectantly. as it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed at his feet. george turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door. he pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.}

<B>__{gray screen}
<A>__{there is the sound of a car idling. george opens his eyes. above him is the carport and jill's yellow mustang has just pulled in. george rises. he walks into the living room as jill comes down the steps to the kitchen, carrying the paper. the kitchen clock reads 4:44. george glances at it. then back at jill. she looks at him, frightened but not moving. her hair is stringy and she's got no makeup on. there's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of which george will note in the course of the scene. george looks her up and down.}

<D>__{what is.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you didn't plan on fucking him tonight.}

<D>__{you did fuck him, didn't you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'm very tired, george.}

<D>__{well, did you get a job out of it at least?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'd like you to leave now.}

<D>__{ and take this with you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{where did this come from?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{who knows, i'm sure you don't but if it'll help any, i found it in your bed.}

<D>__{where's mary?}
<C>__{devra}
<D>__{she hasn't showed up yet.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(grumbling something under his breath, then:)}
<D>__{norman!}
<P>__{(to devra)}
<D>__{devra, i asked you to call jackie. call her.}
<C>__{devra}
<P>__{(perturbed)}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{norman from upstairs shouts down.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{somebody's going to have to wash mrs. young. mary's not here.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you do it.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(he's had about enough)}
<D>__{look, norman, i'm not the shampoo girl.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you are today.}
<A>__{george starts to say something but he's tired. he goes to his corner, slams his jacket down.}
<C>__{mrs. shumann}
<D>__{temper, temper, george.}
<A>__{george fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses, knocks over one where the top was not on, and the shampoo spills all over the table top and starts to drip on the floor.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, jesus, that fucking goddam mary }
<A>__{he starts to look for a rag and sees that mary, wearing a cloth coat is coming into the shop.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{mary! get over here!}
<A>__{mary moves very slowly, george waits, hands on hips. it should almost be a little faggy, his petulance as if, inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{mary, where were you yesterday? huh?}
<A>__{mary doesn't answer.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you ran out on me and you left it like a goddamn pig pen.}
<A>__{mary's swaying.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{what's wrong, mary, are you drunk? look, i've had a rough night, one of the roughest i've ever had, now i'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? are you sick? are you drunk? can you work?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{otis is dead.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ otis?}
<A>__{she points to his picture on the wall.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{my son otis. he was killed in vietnam. they done phoned me at the shop yesterday.}
<A>__{it's suddenly very quiet. the sound of the shampoo dripping on the floor can be heard.}
<B>__{george and mary}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, mary.}
<A>__{mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on george's shoulder.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, george... you know better...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ oh sweetheart...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ you shouldn't do me like that...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(hugging her)}
<D>__{ please, please forgive me...}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{ you know better...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{ why did you come in today?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ left my bag, didn't have no money...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ how did you get here?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ took a bus.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ c'mon, i will get you home...}
<L>__{exterior street george day}
<A>__{on his cycle drives up bowmont into jackie's driveway. her car is there. george jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door. it's open and he barges in. he's met by jackie's yorkies who bark furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for attention.}
<C>__{jackie's voice}
<D>__{ just a minute, you're early }
<A>__{jackie comes walking out. she's carrying a large cooking spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a pantsuit. she's wearing more makeup than usual. she stops when she sees george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ good afternoon }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ you've got to leave.}
<A>__{george is not prepared for this.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've got to leave?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{lester's on his way.}
<A>__{george stares at her then walks past her into the living room. bags are packed, a coat thrown over them. the wire kennel carrying cages for the yorkies are beside the bags. george looks into the kitchen where jackie's been cooking some pasta.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{please, we'll have to talk later }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{look about last night }
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(exasperated but not unkind)}
<D>__{forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when i get back }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's not okay, i mean we've got to talk now. where are you going?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{look either you leave or i leave because i don't want the two of us here when lester arrives. i just don't }
<A>__{the level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty decibels. there's the sound of a car outside.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{my god that's him }
<A>__{george looks out the window.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ it's malone's.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's it, then i'm leaving.}
<A>__{with that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes out the door. george starts after her. the dry cleaner comes to the door, stopping george.}
<C>__{cleaner}
<D>__{cleaners.}
<A>__{george has to fumble with jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs contained. he does, tosses the cleaning down and races outside to his bike.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{he sees jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill, winding around the curves. george guns his bike and takes off after her. around winding curves george almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. jackie's on the curve above him. at the next curve george catches up with her, pulls even to her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{pull over, pull over!}
<A>__{he threatens to run her into the curb. she stops the car sharply and jumps out.}
<B>__{at the top of the drive}
<A>__{they've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view lot' not built on. yellow october weeds cover it and there's a huge television antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon wind. jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. she grabs one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down below her. her house can be seen from this angle, the malone's truck just pulling away. george comes up to her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(looking below her)}
<D>__{you're going to kill me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(turning to him, imploring)}
<D>__{well then what are you trying to do }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i want to marry you. i want to take care of you and i want your children, and i want you to be my girl. that's all i want. that's all i want out of my life, and it's a lot.}
<A>__{she stares at him in disbelief. she actually clutches her stomach.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{look, i don't know if i will ever make it. i mean i'm a fuckup, but i will take care of you, i will make you happy, i swear to god i will.}
<A>__{jackie doesn't answer. she slowly sinks to the ground. george sinks beside her. her eyes are wet.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{jackie... jackie?... answer me, for god's sake, answer me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if you knew how many times i wanted to hear you say that...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so i'm saying it...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's too late...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what's too late about it? look, we're not dead, are we? that's the only thing that's too late.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{lester's left felicia. he's taking me to acapulco on the five o'clock flight. he's asked me to marry him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so what? you don't love him, do you? answer me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know... jackie?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{george now is very near tears himself. what he says now he has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he holds.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't trust... anyone... but you...}
<A>__{george lets his head fall on her shoulder. she's kneeling, supported by the television aerial, and george cries quietly on her shoulder. she has her arm around him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh my baby...}
<A>__{as she's holding george, and looking down the hill, lester's silver rolls pulls up. lester gets out of the car, goes to the front door.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{god, there's lester...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't go, jackie...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i can't just let him stand by the door...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't leave me...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i've got to... i've got to tell him where i am.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know i've got to.}
<A>__{she gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes back down the hill. george sits under the television aerial and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing}
<L>__{into view.}
<A>__{finally she pulls up while lester is pacing back and forth. she hurries to him. he taxes her by the shoulders. they talk for a moment. the discussion looks like jackie is giving lester directions. she glances uneasily up toward george. george is watching them. he sees that lester and jackie have their backs to him, his arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. they're going through the front door.}
<B>__{the end}
