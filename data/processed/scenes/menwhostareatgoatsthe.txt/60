<A>__{bob is writing in his notebook as lyn drives. he notices lyn keeps looking up at the sky.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{cloud bursting. keeps me in shape.}
<A>__{bob stares up at the clouds.}

<D>__{really? which one?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{that one.}
<A>__{bob tries to work out which cloud he means.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that one?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{no. that one. the big one.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{isn't that one too far away?}
<A>__{lyn looks at bob like he's crazy.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{they're all far away.}
<A>__{he concentrates on the cloud again. sure enough, it thins and fades until it has disappeared. bob stares not sure what to think.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{and it's gone.}
<A>__{lyn, smiling up at the sky, doesn't notice that the car is veering off the road a little. bang! the two men are slammed forward as the car hits something, bob smacking his face off the dash.}
