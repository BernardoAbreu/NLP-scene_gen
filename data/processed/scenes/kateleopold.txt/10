<L>__{19. he glances at her and smiles. she titters, turning away}
<A>__{shyly. they whirl around the dance floor. his smile grows into a broad grin. caught up in the excitement, clara beams up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth. leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.}
<L>__{interior ballroom dance floor night}
<A>__{leopold lumbers into frame with miss fairchild, a woman of immense girth. with great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you dance like an angel, miss fairchild. you light up the room. i thank you.}
<A>__{miss fairchild curtseys heavily. leopold glances at his card, sees the name miss serena clacket and shudders. he spots a very lovely woman hidden amongst the guests. she scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. hiding his dance card, he saunters over.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good evening. i do not believe i have had the pleasure.}
<A>__{the young woman stares vacantly at leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. she puts her pad away.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{...julia carlson.}
<A>__{leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i'm sorry. will you excuse me?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(slightly tipsy)}
<D>__{you are not from the area, are you?}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(smiles and shakes her head "no")}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{this is my estate.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(looking around the room)}
<D>__{well it's not home but it's much...}
<A>__{leopold regards her curiously. the orchestra starts up. there is a hubbub amongst the guests.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{shocking! the ta ra ra boom de ay.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{the? oh, that's from paris, isn't it?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it is a scandal nonetheless.}
<A>__{leopold spots uncle otto observing him from across the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson, do me the honor?}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(smiling seductively)}
<D>__{truly i would be in your debt. any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{no, no. really, i...}
<A>__{leopold stiffly holds out his arm. a beat. carlson, stuck, takes it with hesitation and is escorted to the dance floor. they dance. all but leopold and carlson gaily sing "ta ra ra boom de ay." leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i suppose we really ought to sing along.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, golly.}
<A>__{they half sing, half speak the ta ra ra boom de ay, their emphasis on "boom." laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. the room spins. finally:}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{thank you for the dance. it was lovely. i hope it wasn't too awful for you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{not at all. it was most enlightening.}
<A>__{there is a slight pause. the grandfather clock strikes midnight.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i really must be going.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i won't hear of it.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(moving away from him)}
<D>__{no, i'm quite late as it is.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i shall see you to the door...}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(stopping him resolutely)}
<D>__{you're very sweet. i had a wonderful time.}
<P>__{(she watches him,}
<D>__{memorizing his face.}
<P>__{then firmly)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. he watches carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. he surveys the room. after a moment he follows her.}
