<A>__{warner and elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio. elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute. nervous and excited.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{here's to us.}
<A>__{warner is slower to sip his.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{the reason i wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future.}
<A>__{elle is on the edge of her seat.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i ' m fully amenable to that discussion.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{i mean, we're having a lot of fun now — but things are gonna be different when i ' m at harvard law school is a completely different world. i need to be serious.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{my family expects a lot from me. and i expect a lot from me. i .plan on running for office some day.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{and i fully support that.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{but the thing is, if i ' m gonna be a senator by the time i ' m thirty — i can't keep dicking around.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i completely agree.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{that's why i think it's time for us to—}
<A>__{elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation.}
<C>__{warner }
<P>__{(continuing) . . • >}
<D>__{i think we should break up.}
<A>__{elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and crashes onto the patio.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{i ' m sorry, elle, i just —}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you're breaking up with me?!}
<P>__{(tearing up)}
<D>__{i thought you were proposing.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{proposing?! elle, if i ' m going to be a politician, i need to marry a jackie, not a — marilyn.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you're breaking up with me because i ' m too blonde?}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{that's not entirely —}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{then what? my boobs are too big?}
<C>__{warner.}
<D>__{elle — no • your boobs are fine —}
<A>__{her tears start.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{so when you said you'd always love me, you were just "dicking around"?}
<A>__{warner looks around the restaurant nervously.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{i do love you, elle. i just can't marry you. you have no idea the pressure i ' m under. my family has five generations of senators. my brother is in the top three at yale law. he just got engaged to a vanderbilt, for crissakes.}
<A>__{elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face, then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.}
<C>__{warner }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's not like i have a choice, sweetheart}
<A>__{he follows her out.}
