<L>__{int ext cruisers, t rex feeding area dusk}
<A>__{the cruisers stop on the rise of a hill. they over look a forested area, sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.}
<C>__{tour}
<D>__{the mighty t rex arose late in dinosaur history. dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred and twenty million years, but there were tyrannosaurs for only the last fifteen million years of that period ...}
<A>__{farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing at the water's edge. their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface, break apart with the continuing drops of rain. hear lightning rhythmic ally pulses the sky. all is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas and the tapping of light rain. regis calls grant on the walkie talkie.}
<C>__{regis }
<D>__{you know, dr. grant, hammond likes to come here in the evening and just sit.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{where is the t }
<A>__{rex?}
<C>__{regis }
<D>__{good question.}
<A>__{on grant as he takes that in, nodding to himself. studies the land.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.}
<A>__{over walkie regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.}
<C>__{regis }
<D>__{would if she could, believe me. some times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration. but the t rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences. believe me, she can't go anywhere.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{then where is she?}
<A>__{they hear a soft bleating. in the center of the field, a small cage rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground. the cage bars slide down. a goat remains tethered in the field, bleating plaintively. the tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.}
<B>__{back on contro}
<A>__{l room hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group. muldoon limps into the control room. arnold looks over.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{just checking in. everything ok?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{look at them. leaning out the windows, so eager. they can't wait to see it. they have come for the danger.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{that's what i'm afraid of.}
<A>__{muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers. back on cruisers, t rex feeding area grant watches quietly. the bleating becomes louder, more insistent. the goat tugs frantically at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{what's going to happen to the goat? is the t rex gonna come eat the goat?}
<A>__{grant senses something. he sits straight up. looks out intently.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{he's here.}
<A>__{the goat is tethered in the middle of the fi eld, thirty yards from the nearest tree. grant scans the tree for the t rex. the goat senses something too. it struggles and strains, bleating frantically. suddenly the mechanical sound of the cage coming up. its bars surround the goat with safety once again.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{looks like the rex will have its snack a little later today.}
<C>__{recorded voice}
<D>__{the sensors don't see the rex around. she usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner. if she doesn't, that means she's sleeping we might have access to her at the picnic area.}
<A>__{lex and timmy let out a sigh of relief. the tension is gone.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i didn't want to see him get eaten. i liked the goat.}
<A>__{back in the control room hammond studies the large video monitor. he watches grant and gennaro. their voices are heard in the control room.}
<D>__{gennaro (monitor}
<A>__{ed)}
<D>__{what is a carnivore got out?}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{there'd be no stopping it. huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct.}
<A>__{hammond glares. arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{damn those people. they are so negative.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{it's natural. they can't fully appreciate that we've engineered the animals and the park for total safety.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{they comb this island like a bunch of accountants. they don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{you can't make people experience wonder.}
<A>__{hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park. the quartz floodlights outside their area come on with a rosy glow and the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection. at his console, nedry looks at hamm ond. hammond stares out the window. the rain picks up and bounces off the window. hammond speaks to arnold without turning.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's like the garden of eden out there. this is the most beautiful time of day.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{better rout the tour back. they can start again sun up tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{yup. call the kitchen. those kids'll be hungry when they get in.}
<A>__{arnold picks up the phone. static. he glances over at nedry.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{sorry 'bout that. i've taken all the lines to upload some data.}
<A>__{hammond's annoyed, but contains it. arnold looks at nedry, who smiles.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{i will clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir. here you go now, this will make it all better, mr. hammond.}
<A>__{nedry punches in a code.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{ nedry's fat finger punching a last key. close on amber video display terminal as a countdown begins. as the screen counts down from ten to zero, nedry peers at hammond with a steely glint in his eyes. back on screen three, two, one, the countdown hits zero. nedry's data filled screen blinks off. nedry looks up to the rack of monitors. unnoticed by hammond or arnold two more monitors go blank. then a third one. back on cruisers, rest area night the electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the park. huge quartz lights reveal a dramatic view down to the ocean. there the supply ship, the anne b, unloads its last crates. rain increases. on the other side of the road are picnic tables, an unfinished snack bar and rest rooms. to the side of this rest area is a view of the interior of the island. a guard rail separates visitors to the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of this is a tall, electrified fence. surrounding the electric fence is a smaller protective fence.}
<D>__{pre recorded voice ... enjoy a healthy snack. this is also a good time to ...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hey, is that bathroom working?}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(he uses his walkie)}
<D>__{rest stop.}
<A>__{the kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain. grant gets out of his cruiser, strides to regis. he indicates the fence.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{is that still the t rex paddock?}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{yes. but she never comes here. i don't know why not. probably too much construction.}
<A>__{gennaro, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean. gennaro's pov the anne b unloads he last cargo crate. grant looks at the concrete moat. studies its deep curve. he looks up at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning. he sees conventional power lines on the opposite sid e of the road. camera examines the empty cruisers. inside, the pre recorded voice is chatting on. it slows eerily and stops. video screens blink out. back on control room nedry yawns loudly.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{yup! looks like a never ending weekend for me. i'm gonna get a diet coke. don't touch my console, ok? line will be clear in five minutes.}
<A>__{nedry leaves. hammond swings around and growls under his breath.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{slob!}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{well, at least he knows what he's doing.}
