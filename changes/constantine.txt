<LOC>__{INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE}
<ACTION>__{Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like atomized ether. There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES. DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FINAL CELL}
<ACTION>__{A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying. He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through.}
<LOC>__{INT. NARROW CHANNEL}
<ACTION>__{Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.}

<LOC>__{INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER}
<ACTION>__{pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates. And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons. He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light. He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through. Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a Nazi flag. At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead. As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MYSTERIOUS POV}

<ACTION>__{Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road. Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car. BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap. CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires. He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured. Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL has appeared as if embossed in the flesh. Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off. OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.}

Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical. On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door. Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one that's gone bad. The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here. GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER --}

John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing tip drooped over the edge.

<ACTION>__{Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan. He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this. John has no choice -- slaps her.

John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances to Hennessey. What the hell? MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM. John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.}

<ACTION>__{John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance. He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick. This image is repeated over and over. John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.}

<ACTION>__{Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch them, shake their hands. A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished veneer. This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here. He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers. JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something. No one there. Balthazar is gone. JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause.}

John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED." He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
