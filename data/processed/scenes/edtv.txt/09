<L>__{interior cynthia's office day}
<A>__{she's watching ray's tape. ray thinks he's funnier and cuter than he is.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{all my friends tell me "ray, you've got too much personality for one guy." it's like at a party i'm at the center of the attention. everybody loves me.}
<A>__{he gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{ha, ha, ha. i will kick your ass. no really, let me show you my girlfriend. she's really cute.}
<A>__{he reaches out and grabs shari's wrist. shari is struggling to stay out of frame. we just see her arm and ray pulling on it. ray lets go.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{she's strong, 'cause she's a fedex girl. she lifts those packages. but she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty.}
<A>__{cynthia fast forwards we see the camera shooting an empty space. then ed's head appears sideways right in front of the camera.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hello i'm ed.}
<A>__{he starts to sniff.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{what smells?}
<A>__{he steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he sniffs. he's more relaxed than ray.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{what is that smell? oop, i think it's this idea. one person on tv all day long?}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<B>__{we hear laughs}
<A>__{the real tv staff are enjoying ed's tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{seriously, get your resumes in order. when my brother ray whose personality you were just dazzled by told me he was going to try out for this i said, "why in the world would anyone want to be on tv all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life i mean... why would anyone want to do that? but then i thought of a reason...}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{why the hell not?}
<A>__{he kisses the lens, smudging it. cynthia, watching, cracks up. the others seem to like him to.}
