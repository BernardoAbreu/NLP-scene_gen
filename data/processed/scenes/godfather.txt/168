<L>__{ext day: baronial estate}
<A>__{a green ribboned field of a baronial estate. further ahead is a villa so roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of pompeii. there is a group of young village girls accompanied by two stocky matrons, dressed in black. they have been gathering the pink sulla, purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. they are singing, off in the distance as they work. michael, calo and fabrizzio are silent as they watch this fantasy like scene.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<P>__{(calling out to them)}
<D>__{hey, beautiful girls!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{shhhhh.}
<A>__{he settles down to watch. the girls are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies. they are still in their teens, but developed and womanly. they are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove. three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove. the girl being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing. they come closer and closer. just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the three men. she stands there on her toes about to run. michael sees her; now face to face. he looks. her face. incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{jesus christ, take my soul. i'm dying.}
<A>__{quickly, she turns, and runs away. michael stands up never taking his eyes from her. we hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the shepherds laughing. then he turns to them.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{you got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?}
<A>__{calo pats him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{calo}
<D>__{easy man.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{you can't hide it when you're hit by the thunderbolt.}
