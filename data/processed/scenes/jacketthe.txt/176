<A>__{lorenson wakes up as starks stirs in his sleep, slowly waking up.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you're going to be ok, william. we just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{who are you kidding, doc? you or me?}
<A>__{lorenson doesn't answer.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{can i get some paper and something to write with.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{what for? starks [solemnly] i'm starting to think i'm really gonna die soon. so i'd like to write some things down.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i'm not gonna let that happen.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you still don't believe me, do you?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i do believe you...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. listen to me...the kid, eugene...}
<A>__{lorenson still gets taken aback by starks' knowledge of eugene.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no one knows you're working with him so how would i have found out? he's your friend's son, right?}
<A>__{it's true; no one could have known about lorenson's private life. starks coughs, clearly in great pain.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{william, i can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{listen to me. that's all i ask.}
<A>__{lorenson has no choice.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. he has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{who told you this?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you did, in the future. you figured it out because a part of you already knows this. that's how it works. [beat] i'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.}
<A>__{starks closes his eyes, gathering what strength he can.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't know when it'll happen but soon i think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.}
<A>__{that's all starks can manage before lorenson sees he's about to pass out again.}
