<L>__{exterior vegetable market day}
<A>__{ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk vegetable stand elbowing his way through the ladies, testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back till the greengrocer spots him.}
<C>__{greengrocer}
<D>__{you! out! out! i told you, i calla cops!}
<A>__{the other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding involvement. as the greengrocer grabs ratso, joe ambles into the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hey, looka here, that ain't nice, picking on a cripple...}
<A>__{joe intervenes just long enough for ratso to escape, then ambles on, leaving the greengrocer in frustrated fury. camera holds on a tray of coconuts.}
