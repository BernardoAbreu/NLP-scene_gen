<L>__{interior christine's house day}
<A>__{christine opens the door to find reverend briegleb and another man on her porch, s. s. hahn, late fifties.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{mrs. collins, i want you to meet a friend of mine, mr. hahn.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{mrs. collins. my deepest condolences on your loss.}
<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{can we come in?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yes...of course.}
<A>__{she steps aside to let them in, closing the door under:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{mr. hahn, was it?}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as walter's.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{but he was identified, was he not?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yes, but...i guess i still can't accept it. it doesn't feel real to me.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{it never does. i lost a daughter to polio five years ago. there's not a day goes by i don't think, i should mention this to claudine... then i remember she's not here.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i'm sorry. please, sit.}
<A>__{they do as christine looks to briegleb.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. they won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. they say it's not necessary.}
<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{i know. my sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. they're going to say that jones and the rest of the lapd did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the city council to call for a hearing by the welfare board.}
<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{jut one problem.}
<P>__{(more)}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{rev. briegleb }
<D>__{not one lawyer outside this room was willing to take on the police department. too risky, they said. so finally i went to the very best attorney in town, a man who's sued the city four times and won. unfortunately, we could never afford to hire him.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{i see....}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{which is why i'm doing this pro bono.}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{it would be my honor to defend your honor, mrs. collins. in my fifteen years as a lawyer, i have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.}
<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{now i want you to tell mr. hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the city council involved.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{of course. one thing, though. a personal favor. when we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{of course. where downtown?}
