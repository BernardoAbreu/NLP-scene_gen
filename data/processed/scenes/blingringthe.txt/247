<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i was friends with her mother }
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{mom, this is my interview. i met her when my parents divorced. now she lives with us, my mom's home schooled us all for a while.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{the philosophy of `the secret', it's based on the law of attraction, but my great grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy. it's man's relationship to the divine, that's what energy science means.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{since i was young i learned about every religion.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so, sam was in your ballet class, did she have parents?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{she had a dysfunctional background, we both did...}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{and i met her mom }
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{can i talk please?! the reason we related so well is my dad is a recovering alcoholic and sam's mom is..}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{a practicing...}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{a practicing drug addict and alcoholic and our moms became best friends and...}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{and then she went off the deep end, she was on the verge }
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{please! i told you that if you're going to be here you had to be quiet! that's why i didn't want you here because you talk!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so, basically you took her in.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{yes, we took her in about 6 years ago.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{but let's get back to nicki.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so adam here told me you do charity work.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{yes, we do a lot of stuff through our church, it's agape church.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{it's the religious science philosophy being taught at agape church.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{my other sister, gabby is on a trip with them now helping build homes. and they do a yearly trip to africa where they build wells and schools for kids.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{which country?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{uh, i can't remember exactly which country... we do bake sales and feeding the homeless, that kind of stuff.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ok, so it's a little bit of a disconnect with these positive pursuits and what's happening now.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{nicki, i don't want you to answer that comment.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i think that i'm a firm... i have a good statement to say.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{she can speak generally.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i'm not gonna speak about the case, what i was going to say is that i'm a firm believer in karma and i think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being.}
<A>__{nicki is getting emotional as she speaks, her voice quivers.}
<C>__{nicki }
<D>__{i don't think the universe chose a better person than me because from this it's not just affecting me, it's affecting the media and everyone and i think i'm meant to bring truth to all this....i believe that i am an old soul.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{yes, she is.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{we have gotten to know nicki and her family and we feel nicki is an extremely focused, honest person who has a lot to provide to the community.}
<C>__{shannon }
<D>__{and we agree that there hasn't been a disconnect, that there were circumstances that happened but nicki herself continued to stay on her plane despite the tumultuous experiences happening.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what's your goal or life plan if you have one?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i do, i think my journey is to be a leader and push for peace and for the health of our planet }
<A>__{nicki starts to get teary eyed.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{it's my main goal. god didn't give me these talents and what i look like to sit around and just be a model or famous. i want to do something people notice, that's why i'm studying business, so i can be a leader and take a stand for people.}
