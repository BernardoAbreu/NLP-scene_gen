Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather. He even wears a hat.

There is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men. MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy helicopter track. We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit.

If anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: "Did I hear a shot?" "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside."  "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?" "Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?"

<ACTION>__{Sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead.  Sonny and Sal and all of them come alert.  As Sheldon and the other FBI men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights become visible, taxiing towards the limo.}

<DIAL>__{Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.}
<ACTION>__{Sheldon has been walking down to the limo.  He stops beside Mulvaney and KNOCKS on the window.  Mulvaney rolls it down.}

<CHAR>__{SONNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION_ALT>__{ON MARIA}
<ACTION>__{As she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary she's counting.  IMPROVISE goodbyes, tearful and fearful all around.  Then:}
<CHAR>__{MARIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I pray for your safety...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(meaning Sonny and Sal)}
<DIAL>__{...Sal?  Because I know it's your first plane trip.  Don't be scared, you know?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gives him her rosary)}
<ACTION>__{And Maria walks away.  Now the plane has taxied into position, where it can be seen in floodlights.  It looks big and impressive.  We know the FBI has snipers ringing it.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(turns to Sal again)}
<DIAL>__{Sal, keep it up, huh?  The gun - please...}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE - SONNY looking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun.  The rifle stands straight up between his legs.  Sheldon leans down, peering in at him.}
<CHAR>__{SONNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you think, Sal?  You ready to go?}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE - SAL in front of Sonny, behind Mulvaney.  For the first time he smiles.  He realizes that escape is within their grasp.  The smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth.}

<DIAL>__{You ready to get out first?}
<CHAR>__{DRIVER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Driver starts to turn in the driver's seat! Sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out windshield. Mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck. Sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react. DRIVER TURNING HAS A GUN OVER THE BACK OF THE SEAT! Sonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment. Sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in. Mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor. Sal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late bringing his gun up. Driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal between Miriam and Margaret in middle row. Sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard.  Sonny lets it go. Sal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up... Driver FIRES. Mulvaney hits the floor. Sheldon holds Sonny's gun. Sonny, CLOSE, watches. Sal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward. Another SHOT hits him, flinging his head back. Driver holds his third shot, turns to Sonny - holds gun to his temple. Sonny looks down so he can see fully as: Sal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into Sonny's eyes, upside down. He stares sadly, into Sonny's eyes.  As though he knew it all along -- betrayed. And dies. The SHOT is ECHOING.  Now SCREAMS, YELLS, SLAMMING doors, panic... Sonny's voice:  "Shoot me!  For God's sake, shoot me!"}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FULL SHOT}
<ACTION>__{They come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically away from it.  The limo -- the people fleeing it.  Agents pull people away from the car. Driver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back.  Sal's body lies slumped. Driver, Sheldon, other Cops stand about, recovering.  No one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just another job.  Driver clears his weapon, hands it to Sheldon to be filed in case of investigation. ON SYLVIA, MULVANEY, HOSTAGES They hug, cry, laugh, jump up and down: they're alive!}
