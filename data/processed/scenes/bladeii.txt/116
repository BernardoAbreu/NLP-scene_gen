<A>__{whistler panics, backing away from the sounds of the reapers slaughtering chupa. he finds his gun, flicks on the uv entry light and just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished. whistler whirls about, sweeping the uv beam around, but all he sees is darkness. then, a bone chilling whisper cuts through the shadows.}
<C>__{nomak }
<D>__{whistler.}
<A>__{whistler spins. nomak right behind him. as whistler whips the uv gun up, nomak stops it. the beam is mere millimeters from the reaper's face close enough to illuminate his nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.}
<C>__{nomak }
<D>__{if you survive this, tell your master. my end is my beginning.}
<A>__{in an eyeblink, nomak is gone. whistler spins, shining the uv this way and that. alone in the dark.}
