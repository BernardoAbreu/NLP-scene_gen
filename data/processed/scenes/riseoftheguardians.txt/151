<A>__{pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the shadows, casting multiple versions of himself along the alley walls. suddenly, in their moment of distraction, pitch rises up behind jack, his nightmare sand axe in hand.}

<D>__{jack, look out!}
<A>__{the other guardians look on in horror as a golden whip wraps itself round pitch's hands. we follow the whip to reveal sandy, coalescing from the funnel cloud of dreamsand. he gives pitch a look, wags his finger, and then uppercuts him into the air.}
