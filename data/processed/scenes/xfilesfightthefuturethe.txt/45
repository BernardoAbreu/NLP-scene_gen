<L>__{interior fbi office of professional review day}
<A>__{a formal hearing. several assistant directors sit at a head table, going over documents. name placecards in front of them. panning the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of importance, under:}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{...there is a heightened need at the attorney general's office to place responsibility as early as possible.}
<B>__{camera landing on assistant director jana cassidy}
<A>__{a no nonsense 40 year old lawyer cum fbi agent.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{...for the catastrophic destruction of public property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities...}

<B>__{agent scully}
<A>__{at a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously empty.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{many details are still unclear; some agents' reports have not been filed, or have come in sketchy, without a satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in dallas. but we're under some pressure to give an accurate picture of what happened to the attorney general, so she can issue a public statement.}
<A>__{the door to the room opens behind scully now, and mulder enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to a function.}
<B>__{resume a.d. cassidy}
<A>__{she looks up at mulder and scully with a stern glare.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{we now know that five people died in the explosion. special agent in charge darius michaud who was trying to defuse the bomb that had been hidden in a vending machine. three firemen from dallas, and a young boy.}
<B>__{over mulder and scully}
<A>__{mulder pulls out his chair to sit down, but remains standing. they trade a look. this is new news to them.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{excuse me the firemen and the boy they were in the building?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{agent mulder, since you weren't able to be on time for this hearing, i'm going to ask you to step outside so that we can get agent scully's version of the facts. so that she won't have to be paid the same disrespect.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{we were told the building was clear.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you'll get your turn, agent mulder. please step out.}
<A>__{mulder trades looks with:}
<B>__{a.d. skinner}
<A>__{who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically. he's been here with mulder on many occasions. seen mulder run up against the bureau and its stiff conventions. always in the middle.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{it does say there in your paperwork that we were the ones who found the bomb...}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{thank you, agent mulder. we'll call you in shortly.}
<A>__{resume mulder, scully as mulder slides his chair in. scully watching him exit.}
