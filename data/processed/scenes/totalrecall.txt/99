<A>__{the solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead end street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of the windows) in pursuit. at the end of the street, however, bennie doesn't stop but continues going into a large opening. it is an abandoned mine. the bigger car follows him, but won't fit. the roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into the narrow opening. the second official car pulls up behind. a chauffeur jumps out and opens the rear door. cohaagen steps out. he sur veys the scene. the four men in the wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the wreckage. they are covered in blood and their clothes are in shreds.}
