<D>__{why did you order tea?}
<B>__{she eats cereal.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{because you ordered raisin bran.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i ordered raisin bran because i didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{it can still be a date if you order raisin bran.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{it's not a date. so how's your thing going your dancing thing?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{it's good. how's your restraining order?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with nikki is, and i've been doing pretty well. except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{and the so called incident with the weights.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{yeah. that was a thing with my parents. i wish i could just explain it all in a letter to nikki because it was minor and i could just explain it and let her know that i'm actually not out of control and that i'm actually doing really well.}
<B>__{tiffany takes this in. beat.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i can get a letter to nikki. i see her sometimes with my sister.}
<A>__{pat can't believe what he is hearing.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{it would be so amazing if you could get a letter to nikki from me.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{i'd have to hide it from veronica. she's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{but you would do it?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{i'd have to be careful. i'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how i lost my job.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{how did you lose your job?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{by...having sex with everybody in the office.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{everybody?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{i was very depressed after tommy died. it was a lot of people.}

<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{mm hmm.}

<A>__{she told you what to do?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{oh...my god. nikki hated when i talked like this. made me feel like such a pervert. maybe we should change the subject.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{i don't mind it.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{you don't, do you.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{no. but then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. so i accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i get it. the song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i heard about that.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{...it was my wedding song and when i hear it, i go kinda crazy. sometimes i hear it when it's not even playing.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{yeah. so they put me on medication, which i feel ashamed of.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{so i know.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you do.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i just gotta get a strategy, you know?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{we'd better get back to the letter.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yeah, let's get back to the letter.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{what if you told nikki when veronica was in the bathroom?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yes. yes, that could work. i love that.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{oh, my god, i'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.}
<B>__{pat begins to slide out of the booth.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{can i at least finish my tea?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{wait, what?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{my tea. can i finish it?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{wait a minute. did veronica tell nikki about our dinner? why would she do that? was it a test?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{i kinda got that feeling, yeah.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{goddamn it. i knew it. it was a test. how did i do? i think i did pretty well.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{yeah, she said you were cool, basically.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{"basically"? was i some percentage not cool?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{no, she said you were cool, but you know.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{no, i don't know.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{sort of how you are. it's fine, relax.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{what do you mean? how am i? what does that mean?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{sort of like me.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{"sort of like you"? i hope to god she didn't tell nikki that.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{why?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{because, it's just not right, lumping you and i together, i mean, it's just wrong. and nikki wouldn't like that. especially after all the shit you just told me.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you think that i'm crazier than you.}
<C>__{pat}
<P>__{(scoffs) (chuckling)}
<D>__{because, well, we're different, i mean }
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{oh, my god. ugh. you're killing me. you know what? forget i offered to help you. forget the entire fucking idea. `cause that must have been fucking crazy because i am so much crazier than you.}
