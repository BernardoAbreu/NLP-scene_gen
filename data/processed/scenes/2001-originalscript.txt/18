<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{low ceiling conference room}
<A>__{u shaped table facing three projecting screens. seated around the table are twenty senior base personnel.}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, i should like to introduce dr. heywood floyd, a distinguished member of the national council of astronautics. he has just completed a special flight here from earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. dr. floyd.}
<A>__{polite applause. floyd walks to front of room.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{first of all, i bring a personal message from dr. howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.}
<A>__{polite applause.}
<C>__{floyd }
<D>__{mr. halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the base. i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on earth. i can understand and sympathize with your negative views. i have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. but i fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and i hope you will. it should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{floyd }
<D>__{this is the view of the council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. are there any questions?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{dr. floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?}
<C>__{floyd}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{i'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council. and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from everyone who had any knowledge of this event. there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any consideration can be given to making a public announcement.}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{we will, of course, cooperate in any way possible, dr. floyd.}
<B>__{several scenic views of moon rocket bus skimming over surface of moon inside rocket bus}
<A>__{floyd, halvorsen, michaels, fourth man, pilot and co pilot. all in space suits minus helmets. floyd is slowly looking through some photographs and magnetic maps of the area. he looks out of the window thoughtfully. the photographs are taken from a satellite of the moon's surface and have numbered optical grid borders, like recent mars photos. a few seats away, michaels and halvorsen carry out a very banal administrative conversation in low tones. it should revolve around something utterly irrelevant to the present circumstances and very much like the kind of discussion one hears all the time in other organizations.}
