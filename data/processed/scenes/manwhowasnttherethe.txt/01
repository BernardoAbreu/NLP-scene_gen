<D>__{ed?}
<A>__{a track forward reveals doris sitting at a vanity, doing her hair. her dress is half zipped at the back.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{...gimme a zip.}
<A>__{ed walks over behind her.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{me? us! the party at nirdlinger's i told you last week, for the christmas push.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{we are close on the zipper as ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, the lowers it slightly. her back blooms through the dark fabric of the dress. he slides the zipper up, and doris reaches for a perfume atomizer.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{come on, get ready. it's important.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{nah, go ahead. i'm not big on parties.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{oh, don't be a grump.}
<B>__{sales floor}
<A>__{it is festooned with streamers. ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the other bringing a cigarette to his lips. band music plays and nirdlinger's employees whirl on the dance floor. bobby soxed teenagers lindy hop and pass palms over their knees. a thin young man in a sports coat stands next to ed, watching, his adam's apple bobbing.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{wild, man!}
<A>__{he goes out onto the dance floor. ed, left by himself, gazes across the floor. his view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows big dave worriedly talking to doris. doris reacts angrily. big dave morosely absorbs the angry words from doris. he glances up toward ed and notices his gaze with consternation. he gives doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you in ladies' wear?}
<A>__{the young man with the adam's apple is back, looking out at the floor, snapping his fingers.}
<C>__{ed}

<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{a hand is laid on ed's shoulder. it is big dave; he leans in to murmur:}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{ed. can i talk to you?}
<A>__{big dave's office music from the party drifts in only faintly. the office is built into a corner of the sales floor. it is dominated by a large desk. a large window on the far side affords a partial view of the floor.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{siddown. siddown...}
<A>__{ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. dave fumbles nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. he trims the end of the cigar with a short double bladed knife with a steel grip.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...souveniered it off a jap in new guinea.}
<A>__{he hands one cigar to ed, takes one for himself, then drags up a chair to face ed's.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i guess you're wondering what doris was so hot about.}
<A>__{the office is dark, the only illumination coming from the window onto the bright sales floor behind big dave. ed leans forward for dave to light his cigar.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...these're havanas. romeo and juliets. private stock.}
<A>__{dave, having lit ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...ed, i...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what is it, dave?}
<A>__{dave breaks down, weeping. he buries his face in his hands, the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his hair.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{ed, i've been weak...}
<A>__{his shoulders heave.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i've, uh... i've, uh... thanks.}
<A>__{ed has taken dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i've, uh... oh, jesus. i've been carrying on with a married woman. uh, no one you know. and now the, uh what is it they say? the the the chickens are coming home to roost.}
<A>__{ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{hell, i, i'm not proud of it. but, uh, that's not the worst of it. i got a note. a blackmail note. you know, come across or everybody knows.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{well, you know what that would do to me.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i guess it would be pretty awkward.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{awkward?! ann'd throw me out on my keister! hell, it's her family's store her store. i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, ed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i only work here! and the lady's husband would know... oh, jesus.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{how much to they want, dave?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{$10,000! i don't know what to do, ed. i don't know what i can do. even though i know who the sonofabitch is.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...you know... who who is?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{the sonofabitch. the blackmailer. it's, uh, it's no one you know. it's a businessman from sacramento. a goddamn pansy, ed. he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell. and the very next day, the very next day, ed, i get blackmailed for the same amount.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{would he... it sounds pretty obvious.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{well, i guess he don't care that it's obvious.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mm. how, uh... how did he know that }
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{he's staying at the hotel i've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. must've seen us.}
<A>__{big dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from ed.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...thanks...}
<A>__{he exhales with a long sigh.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...oh, jesus.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...why don't you just pay him, dave?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{that's my capitalization on the annex! my operation, ed! christ almighty. that's what i was just talking to doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{embezzling, ed. from my own goddamn wife!}
<A>__{he give a tearful chuckle.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...doris, she was pretty hot about that. god bless her. she doesn't know i'm telling you this she's mad enough already. but jesus, ed, you're the only one i can talk to. i'm, i'm sorry i... i better get back to the party.}
<A>__{he rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his face.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i look all right?}
<B>__{pulling ed}
<A>__{he has left the office to wander through an adjacent room lit only by spill from the party. it is the music department; pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{in a way i felt bad for big dave. i knew the ten grand was going to pinch him where it hurt...}
<A>__{ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. he takes out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but doris was two timing me and i guess, somewhere, that pinched a little too.}
<A>__{his attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. someone is raising the key guard on a piano across the room. the person can only be seen only obscurely, from three quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of haphazardly arranged instruments. the person begins to play. ed listens. the piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby. the player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his face. the piece ends.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that was pretty.}
<A>__{the player turns, surprised. it is a young woman.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...did you make that up?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh, no. that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven.}
<A>__{ed nods recognition of the name.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that was quite something.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that was something. i'm ed crane.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{i know who you are, mr crane.}
<A>__{his look shows surprise.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{...my father used to take me with him when he got his hair cut. walter abundas?}
<A>__{ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{sorry, i just didn't remember.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{oh, that's all right. you can't be expected to remember every skinny girl who comes in with her dad.}
<A>__{ed give a wry smile.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...you don't like the music out there?}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{it's ok, i guess. no, i don't really. i'm not big on music, ordinarily.}
<A>__{a woman calls sharply from offscreen:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ed.}
<A>__{he looks. silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is doris, coat over her arm, purse in hand. ed's car doris and ed are driving home. doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at the road.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{...what a knucklehead.}

<D>__{dave.}

<C>__{doris}
<D>__{...money problems. he's thinking about canceling the annex.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{that means i don't run nirdlinger's!}
