<L>__{exterior stage evening}
<A>__{tony re enters the stage through the mirror, looking at dr. parnassus who has just come out of his trance with astonishment}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(gobsmacked)}
<D>__{that was so... i had no idea... it's just... incredible.}
<A>__{...and then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour realizing that only a few moments have passed since he entered the mirror.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{..how do you do this?}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(ignoring him and with a big theatrical gesture)}
<D>__{hooplah!}
<A>__{the louis vuitton woman reappears, sitting on a cut out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage. she looks radiant. she is weeping, completely overcome by her experience. parnassus steps forward and helps her to her feet. she kisses his hands in gratitude.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{thank you, thank you, that was so beautiful, i feel so... thank you so much...}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(graciously)}
<D>__{thank you, dear lady, you give me strength to continue}
<A>__{born again, tearful but transcendent, the louis vuitton woman produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque. tony is frozen, confused. the crowd is still... stunned by the louis vuitton woman's transformation as she deposits the cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe. pause... and then the other women rush the stage. mayhem is narrowly averted as tony and percy manage to coral them into a more or less orderly queue. across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods, is mr nick. he watches events, intrigued... ...as tony escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the glass box. tony pays off the cops who move on. tony, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his mask each time he re enters the stage. and now a fourth woman descends. four successes for doctor parnassus.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(aside to percy)}
<D>__{one more to go and we're free.}
<A>__{doctor parnassus spots mr nick across the street, smiles, holds up four fingers. mr nick gives a little `i'm not impressed' smirk and turns away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the shop window as four large dark heavy russian men, all laden with luxury shopping walk past. one of the russians stops..looking at the show..at tony whose mask is sitting on top of his head. the leading russian pulls him on.}
<D>__{vladimir (in russian) subtitled c'mon..what are you watching that crap for.}
<C>__{serge }
<P>__{(pointing at tony)}
<D>__{it's him!}
<C>__{vladimir }
<D>__{who are you talking about?}
<P>__{(following serge's pointed finger)}
<D>__{impossible.}
<C>__{serge }
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<A>__{they start pushing through the crowd. tony, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage, looks up and sees the russians heading through the crowd.. panic!! he pulls the mask down and begins to back up. but it's too late, they've definitely seen him. he spins around and rockets upstage, past dr. parnassus who is deep into his trance. tony dives through the mirror much to the amazement of valentina, anton, percy. the russians chase after him, shoving the queuing women aside, smashing the scenery and knocking anton into the wings.}
