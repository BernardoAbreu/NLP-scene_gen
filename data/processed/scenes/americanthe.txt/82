<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{the wicker picnic hamper is sitting on a rug by between the parked car and the lake. from the hamper, jack removes: a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of aspirinio a loaf of course bread two clods of mozarella 150 gms of proscuitto 100 gms of parma ham a large jar of pitted green olives a thermos of sweet black coffee and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the improved socimi submachine gun. as mathilde starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill, jack checks the stopwatch on his rolex. it takes her approximately twenty eight seconds to assemble the bastardised gun including telescopic sights and sound suppressor and a further three seconds to slot the empty magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. she's almost ten seconds faster than jack. he stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and everything it means.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{rounds?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've made up two sorts.}
<A>__{he reaches into the picnic hamper.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thirty lead and thirty jacketed.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i should like a hundred of each.}
<A>__{it's an order: her voice is emotionless.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{and fifty explosive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not a problem.}
<A>__{he hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{will mercury do?}
<A>__{she smiles almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{mercury will do very nicely.}
<A>__{she puts the gun down butt first, leaning it against the side of the car.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i have made my own targets.}
<A>__{she reaches into her blue canvas sports bag and removes several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split bamboo cane. without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. in her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer skirt sweeps across the flowers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{watch out for vipers.}
<A>__{he keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving with her right hand: the hand holding the ammunition boxes. she's no fool. neither is he. he has the gun. at ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth stones a boundary cairn overgrown with little purple trumpet blooms. she unfolds the cardboard. at this distance all we can make out is a silver grey shape against the stones. returning to the car she picks up the weapon.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{muzzle velocity?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{at least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. that's including twenty off the top for the sound suppression.}
<A>__{impressed, mathilde looks at the marks on the metal where the serial number has been removed with acid.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{socimi?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{eight two one.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i've not had one before.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you'll find it easy. i've re balanced it for the longer barrel. the fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. which won't matter if you're firing and i'm guessing you are from a fixed position.}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no major recoil issues. you should be able to hold onto any target. even the smallest.}
<A>__{mathilde puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and stands with her feet apart, braced. the breeze beneath the walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against her legs. choop! choop! for a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the gun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt would hold a 12 bore.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you've done a good job, mr. clarke. thank you. thank you very much.}
<A>__{she makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight, with her fingernail. she can't have turned the vertical screw more than one notch. then she fully loads and fires again. choop choop choop! jack lifts his binoculars and looks at the target. it's the unmistakable outline of a boeing 747 400, about one and a half metres long. painted against the cut out is the upturn at the end of the wing. the front doorway is shaded in. standing in it is the silhouette of a man. in the centre of his head are three small holes. with the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed rounds, mathilde takes aim again. choop choop choop choop! through his binoculars, jack can see the empty space where the target's head used to be, the scarred stones behind and the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{good shot.}
<A>__{mathilde says nothing. she fills the magazine with lead rounds, snaps it in place and hands the weapon to jack.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{go to the stones and fire near me.}
<A>__{he's taken aback.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{say...}
<A>__{she looks round for a target.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{...into the bush with the yellow flowers. two bursts. five seconds apart.}
<A>__{slowly, jack walks down to the stones, turns and looks back. the citroen is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut tree. so is mathilde. in the poor light all he can see is her dress and her blouse. he wipes the sweat from his eyes and shuts them tightly. this is not just a weapon test... it's a test of trust. he opens his eyes again. mathilde turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon. he aims the socimi at the yellow flowers right beside her. holds his breath. and pulls the trigger. choop! choop! mathilde remains untouched. so do the yellow flowers. troubled, jack blinks rapidly and counts to five. then he fires again. choop! choop! choop! through the sight, we see two stems of yellow blossom fall sideways. relieved, jack walks slowly back to the car.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{the sound suppression is superb. i couldn't place the direction of fire.}
<A>__{from her sports bag she removes a plain brown manilla}
<B>__{envelope.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month. in the meantime would you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight, they are too loose. and lengthen the stock by three centimetres. i also want a sixty round magazine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you'll upset the balance.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i'm prepared to accept that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then i'm happy to oblige.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{what about the a case?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a briefcase. samsonite. standard pattern in black with combination locks. is there a number you'd prefer?}
<A>__{she thinks.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{eight two one.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{eight two one.}
<A>__{mathilde hands him the envelope and disassembles the weapon. jack wraps the socimi parts up in their cloth squares and places them in the bottom of the picnic hamper.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{what do you want done with these?}
<A>__{she has collected up the spent cartridge cases.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{throw them in the lake.}
<A>__{she walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in. fish rise. again, the beauty of the place transfixes her. by the time she turns back, jack has laid out the picnic.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{how thoughtful.}
<A>__{she picks up a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i don't know italian wine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aspirinio. like mosacata but frizzante.}
<A>__{deftly he uncorks a bottle. and pours it into the grass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you chilled the wine. i thought...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it had to be chilled. they're italian cops.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{you think of everything.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm paid to. don't move.}
<A>__{she freezes. jack points slowly. on her tanned forearm is a butterfly.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{they both stare at the insect, transfixed.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{it's so beautiful.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{parnassius apollo. it's endangered.}
<A>__{she looks up at him. like it's a revelation she says:}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you like coming here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it serves its purpose.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you've never taken a woman here before?}
<A>__{jack is momentarily taken aback.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the butterfly flits away.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{perhaps you do not have a woman in your life. it is not easy for us to keep relationships. not in our world.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i have an acquaintance.}
<A>__{a beat. she waits for him to say more. he doesn't.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{friendships are transitory. it is...}
<A>__{suddenly, there's movement in the bushes. jack snatches up his binoculars. mathilde scans the tree cover.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wild boar.}
<A>__{he hands her the binoculars. and hurriedly packs up the picnic.}
