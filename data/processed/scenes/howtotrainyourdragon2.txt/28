<L>__{interior dragon mountain oasis morning}
<A>__{(scene 1800 family reunion) hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. several babies race in to hassle toothless as he naps.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{well, bud, we can't wait around for drago to attack this place. we've gotta find him first. let's go.}
<A>__{suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over hiccup's face muffling his scream! toothless whirls around to find stoick, towering over hiccup. he calms toothless with a touch and releases hiccup.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{easy now.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{are you kidding me? how'd you get in here?}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{the same way we're getting you out.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{all clear!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{toothless. come.}
<A>__{they hurry back into the winding corridor.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad! there's something you need to know!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{this isn't an on the way kind of update, actually...}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{i've heard enough, hiccup.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{... more of the earth shattering development variety.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{yeah, just add it to the pile.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad, unlike most surprises i spring on you, this is one you'll like. i promise! you just have to handle it delicately, so...}
<A>__{they round a tight bend in the corridor to find gobber staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. he shuffles past stoick and hiccup, dazed.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{uh, you might want to take this one. oh, boy.}
<A>__{stoick draws his sword, then braves into the chamber ahead.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{dad, can you put the sword away... please?}
<A>__{stoick gasps as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with a clatter. valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the path. she lets out an audible shudder upon seeing him. he removes his helmet slowly as hiccup, gobber, and toothless appear at stoick's side.}
<C>__{valka}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{i know what you're going to say, stoick. how could i have done this? stayed away all of these years. and why didn't i come back to you? to our son.}
<A>__{stoick steps towards her, wide eyed and speechless. dragons emerge from the recesses behind valka, hissing protectively.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{well, what sign did i have that you could change, stoick? that anyone on berk could?}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{i pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{this is why i never married.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this and one other reason.}
<A>__{stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. with every step, valka becomes increasingly flustered. she backs into an ice wall, with nowhere to go, and stoick just a few paces away.}
<C>__{valka}
<P>__{(tearful)}
<D>__{i know that i left you to raise hiccup alone... but i thought he'd be better off without me. and i was wrong, i see that now, but...}
<A>__{stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{oh stop being so stoic, stoick. go on... shout, scream, say something!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{you're as beautiful as the day i lost you.}
<A>__{his words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. she softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. he caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his fingers. he pulls her into a kiss. she resists briefly, then gives in. the surrounding dragons softly retreat in kind. hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.}
