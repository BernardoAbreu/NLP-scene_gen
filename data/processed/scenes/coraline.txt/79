<L>__{exterior other house night, full moon}
<A>__{she runs out the back porch, towards the other garden.}
<B>__{other steep hillside trail}
<A>__{she crosses the trail, the other house in the distance.}
<B>__{entrance to other orchard}
<A>__{she runs down the path.}
<B>__{other orchard}
<A>__{coraline runs past trees that are lush with green leaves}
<B>__{and ripe red fruit.}
<A>__{she's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. the further she goes, the less tree like the fruit trees become. she hears the cat merowww. surprised, she looks down.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{and what do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{the cat trots along by her feet. she blinks.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{well, i'm gettin' outta here. that's what i'm doing.}
<A>__{the sky starts to brighten and the apple trees become wire thin shapes of trees.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{huh? something's wrong. shouldn't the old well be here?}
<A>__{the remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give way to a pale, empty nothingness. no ground or shadows.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. she only made what she knew would impress you.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{but why? why does she want me?}
<A>__{they walk over the horizon.}
<C>__{cat }
<D>__{she wants something to love, i think. something that isn't her... or maybe she'd just love something to eat.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{eat? that's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters!}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't know. how do you taste?}
<B>__{other house reappears}
<A>__{a shape rises in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful other house. coraline and the cat slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills, white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them fill}
<B>__{in.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{huh? but how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?}
<A>__{the cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its head to one side.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{walk around the world.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{small world.}
<A>__{coraline shivers. the cat suddenly tenses, focuses on a shrub.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{hang on }
<A>__{he bounds towards the shrub and chases out a cute kangaroo mouse in uniform with a tiny trumpet. before coraline can blink, he's pinned it down.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{stop, he's one of the circus mice!}
<A>__{with a swift blow of its paw, the cat knocks the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth. he gives a quick, killing bite coraline gasps and the mouse transforms into a big dead rat. coraline is stunned. he drops the rat on the ground.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.}
<A>__{the cat picks the rat up and heads off. slack jawed, coraline speaks with admiration.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{gooooood kitty.}
<A>__{coraline looks to the house with a determined look. on the porch, she takes out a heavy cane from the umbrella stand and hits it into her hand.}
