<L>__{int control room afternoon}
<A>__{arnold, wu, muldoon, and ellie stare raptly at the monitor.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{son of a bitch. he's taking a nap. hasn't been this well fed ... ever.}
<A>__{hammond is above, in his throne. he calls down:}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{could he drown in that position? that's a very valuable animal.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{i know it's a valuable animal.}
<A>__{muldoon takes a step up toward hammond's throne and the two argue quietly back and forth. in the foreground, wu calls arnold over.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{what's that, john?}
<A>__{wu points to the screen behind arnold's head. in the upper right hand corner, it blinks a yellow warning: aux pwr low! ellie regards it.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you running on auxiliary power?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{looks like you are.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{can't be.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{print the system status log.}
<A>__{arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys. in the corner, a printer whirs to life. moments later, it spins out a single page. arnold tears it off. ellie continues to stare at the screen. it now flashes red: aux pwr fail! an alarm klaxon blares. hammond holds his ears against the noise. he stands up. the room lights begin to flash. they're reflected in hammond's eyes. hammond roars above the chaos.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten. hammond lurches. at zero, the lights go off, the monitors, even the computer. just the alarms keep screaming.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you're ruining my ordered, precise park!}
<A>__{arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons. hammond rushes toward arnold. arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise. hammond screams.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{fix my park, arnold! fix it!}
<A>__{arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking hammond's attack. hammond grabs arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground. breathing heavily, hammond clutches his hand to his own chest. arnold stands up, brushes off. he puts himself together, looks at hammond. he shouts over the siren:}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i know it's hard, i know it's hard, but i'm going to put it all back together for you i promise. i will}
<A>__{back on raft at waterfall grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from toppling over the crashing waterfall. lex and timmy hold onto his legs. the roar of the water diminishes. and the flow subsides from a raging current to a rolling river. and then to a gentle stream. a trickle. nothing. grant slowly relaxes, lets go. so do the children. around the raft, the water level begins to drain. gradually, grant and the kids are left in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water. around them, various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered by rushing white water.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{the waterfall stopped.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i think they cut the power. hey }
<A>__{he points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall once poured. there's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist is the visitor's center.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{well, there's our pot of gold. let's go, kids.}
<A>__{they grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.}
<B>__{back on con}
<A>__{trol room muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is alternate patches of bright and dark. in a hot corner, ellie squats over a prostate hammond, mopping his brow with a cool cloth. he murmurs, only barely intelligible.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{told him, fix my park, fix my park.}
<A>__{wu brings the printout to arnold. the printout is a chronological rendering of control room events since the restart. it is clear they have been running on auxiliary power. wu yells above the alarm:}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{you shut down as six thirty four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{jesus. the auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge. the main generator has to be manually reset.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{outside? in}
<A>__{the generator building? arnold nods. muldoon points to a line in the printout:}
