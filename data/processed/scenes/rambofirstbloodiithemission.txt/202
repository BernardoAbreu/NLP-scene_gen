<A>__{rambo slashes through the trees like a madman, running with everything he has. behind him the napalm canisters hit the ground at the edge of the ruins. an enormous fireball blossoms through the jungle. the canisters' inertia carries them forward, spewing twenty meter long arcs of flame. the inferno engulfs the buddhas and rolls forward through the trees, silhouetting the tiny running figure of rambo. just as the firestorm reaches him he dives at a dead run off an embankment. into a rushing mountain stream about five meters wide.}
