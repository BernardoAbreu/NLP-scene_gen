<A>__{the two men arrange themselves in chairs while the betty look a alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind cleo. bucky tries not to stare. he forces himself to focus on cleo, who, while five years older, looks much better than last time bucky saw him.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<D>__{came into a little change a while back, managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs. (beat) and i don't give a fuck what you think, you and your partner ain't much to look at now. i read the papers.}
<A>__{bucky can't deny that. the young woman brings in two beers for bucky and cleo. bucky checks her out again. cleo knows why.}
<C>__{cleo short }
<D>__{my youngest, christine.}
<A>__{he squeezes her hand affectionately.}
<C>__{cleo short }
<D>__{best housekeeper of the bunch. can't cook a damn, though. got her sister's star eyes for the pictures, damn straight. thinks she's gonna be another goddamn jayne mansfield. get out of here, chrissie...}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the porch.}
<C>__{cleo short }
<D>__{used to be dozens'd stop by, you know. drive up from dago or san berdoo just to snap a shot of the goddamn garage back there. thought maybe they'd find one of betty's dresses in the garbage. jackals.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you didn't move far.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<P>__{wouldn't a mattered if i did. (beat)}
<D>__{whatcha here for, mug? i know you ain't smart enough to solve the case, and you ain't dumb enough to still think i did it...i had an alibi.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{tighter'n a popcorn fart.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<D>__{and that's air tight, mug. air tight.}
<A>__{bucky takes a swig of his beer. cleo's eyes scour bucky.}
<C>__{cleo short }
<D>__{you're hooked on her still, ain't ya? ha. that's a plug nickel you can't spend, ain't it, mug? ha. yea. betty'll do that to a fella. especially someone like you.}
<P>__{(off bucky's look)}
<D>__{like i said, i know you mug.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i just thought...maybe after all this time...there's something you might have forgot...anything she might have said...}
<A>__{cleo studies him, knows bucky's a lost soul. he softens for the first time. leans forward, elbows on knees. almost looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<D>__{she was a terrible actress. i'm sure folks've told you that. she'd practice in front of the john mirror. once or twice she got me in on it...reading parts with her for some audition. she stunk. even a parent could tell. what beth was good at was writing. all her teachers used to say that. not that a grease like me'd know the difference. maybe she coulda written for the pictures. but she wanted to be an actress like every other silly girl.}
<A>__{his gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.}
<C>__{cleo short }
<D>__{your folks still alive?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{my father.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<P>__{(poking)}
<D>__{he proud of his son, the ace copper? or maybe he thought you'd end up champ?}
<A>__{bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. cleo gets it.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<D>__{your momma?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{she killed herself a long time ago.}
<A>__{cleo takes a swig of his beer.}
<C>__{cleo short}
<D>__{probably better off then.}
