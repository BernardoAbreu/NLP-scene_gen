<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{utah asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest. buzzzzzz! the rasp of the doorbell. johnny is airborne, phone flying across the floor. hunting for his pants, realizes they are already on, limps in fast motion to the door.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{tyler! wait, i }
<A>__{whips it open. bodhi standing in the doorway, smiling like an excited child.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{howdy brah.}
<A>__{nathaniel, roach, and grommet are there behind him. they look like sentry dogs. johnny freezes. bodhi walks past utah, into the room.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{c'mon, get your gear on, we're rollin'.}
<A>__{cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance. he moves through the room, grabbing johnny's shirt from a chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor. utah sees his fbi shield sitting on the dresser in plain sight. he palms it when bodhi is turned away, and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what going on, bodhi?}
<A>__{bodhi plucks a couple socks off the couch, hands them to utah.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{here.}
<P>__{(spying johnny's cut face)}
<D>__{hey, what happened? ya cut yourself shaving?}
<A>__{johnny meets bodhi's cold stare.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i don't think i wanna surf right now.}
<A>__{bodhi's face takes on a crazy glow.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{naw, this is different, johnny. this is something totally different... you're gonna love this.}
<A>__{he winds an arm around johnny's shoulders, guides him toward the door.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{c'mon, let's go, let's go. time's wastin', brah.}
<A>__{bodhi claps utah on the back, ushering him outside. nathaniel, roach and grommet fall into step beside them. the door closes behind them. camera drifts back through the apartment, coming to rest on the 9mm beretta, on the floor under the bed... useless.}
