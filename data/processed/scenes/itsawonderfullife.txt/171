<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you mean, i wasn't there? i remember distinctly...}
<A>__{george catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. it now reads "nick's place" instead of "martini's." george and clarence get to their feet.}

<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{what the... hey, what's going on around here? why, this ought to be martini's place.}
<A>__{he points to the sign, and looks at clarence. clarence sort of hangs his head. george fixes him with a very interested look.}

<D>__{look, who are you?}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(patiently)}

<D>__{yeah, yeah, i know. you told me that. what else are you? what... are you a hypnotist?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well then, why am i seeing all these strange things?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{don't you understand, george? it's because you were not born.}

<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{how'm i doing, joseph. thanks.}
