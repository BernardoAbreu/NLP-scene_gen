<A>__{kimble enters. he sits at the counter and a sparky older waitress, late, mid forties, with strong good looks and tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.}
<C>__{older waitress}
<D>__{need to look at the menu?}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{some soup, please.}
<C>__{older waitress}
<D>__{good choice.}
<A>__{she marks her pad and leaves. sights ant sounds around kimble begins to occupy his attention: a dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. he stares at him. a farmer sitting at a table stares at kimble, kimble looks away. a man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. is he calling the police? everyone seems to be looking at him. someone stops in front of him. a young waitress serves him his soup. where's the first waitress? takes a few sips of soup. out of the corner of his eye he sees: the older waitress putting on her coat to leave. is she going to report him? he fights the paranoia. a news report on the television gets his attention. angle tv a report on the escape. a television reporter describes the chase for kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death from the fall. kimble decides it's time to leave. he drops some money on the counter and exits.}
