<D>__{a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, you and your husband are special. ya, gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.}
<A>__{pat beams with joy because harry recognizes the important work she is doing.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how many people do you all feed?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{good god almighty, bless your bones.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but the problem grows.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. we can't feed all the hungry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{of course not. have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? no you ain't.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you have to take just one and fatten him up. when you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. if you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. you just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.}

<D>__{you just take one; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground.}
<A>__{pat watches him and loses herself in what he is doing. she responds automatically}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i don't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i wasn't pointing my finger at you. hey, you have to think of yourself. a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. there are too many bad people out there.}
