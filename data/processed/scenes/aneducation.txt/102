<D>__{god almighty. what have i done?}
<A>__{jenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the cigarettes that david always keeps there. she finds the cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. but she has seen something in there, so she opens it again. she takes out some letters and papers and starts to look through them.}
