<C>__{herdmaster}
<D>__{all for flintstone, bellow now!}
<A>__{fred snorts, sounding like herb alpert's lonely bull. even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort. he kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from barney, of course.}
<C>__{herdmaster}
<D>__{order furs!}
<A>__{the fezzes come up.}
<C>__{herdmaster}

<A>__{piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{thank you, brother chairman. fellow buffaloes, i'm a man of few words. it's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of amalgamated neolithic}
<A>__{.. which means that most of us}
<D>__{aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. so my agenda for tonight... ends right now. there's a time to be a buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double crossin' creep...}
<A>__{all heads turn and swivel to look at fred... swivel back.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{... and there's a time to stand up and be a man! so let's go down there and make the slate shop into slate scrap... then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of neolithic 101! meeting adjourned!}
<A>__{with angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up. fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are slapped on. the buffalo run out. when the dust clears, we see that only one member has avoided the herding instinct: barney. now, he turns, runs into buffalo lodge recreation area night fred is at the bar, opening a beer. he looks wistfully at the old, framed picture on the wall reacts as he sees }

<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(genuinely worried)}
<D>__{oh, no! that that's horrible!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we could end up with half a percent of nothing!}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{no, fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! our brother buffalo could go to jail!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, barn, we gotta stop 'em!}
