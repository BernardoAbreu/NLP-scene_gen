<L>__{interior the duke kitchen night}
<A>__{the sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before veronica and j.d. burst through the door. j.d. moves to the dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're still not listening! i'm not..}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(pulling out the knife)}
<D>__{nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(taking the knife from him)}
<D>__{this knife is filthy.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{what in the hell do you think i'm doing? taking out her tonsils?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i think i know heather a bit better than you, okay? if she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.}
<A>__{j.d. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{how's this? can you see your fucking reflection?}
<A>__{she can and so can the viewer. tears well in veronica's eyes. she begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{tomorrow someone else will move into her place. that person could be me.}
<P>__{(suddenly deliriously defiant)}
<D>__{ha, there's only one of us who knows heather's handwriting and if you think i'm doing another suicide note.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you don't get it, do you? society nods its head at any horror the american teenager can think to bring upon itself. we don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?}
<A>__{j.d. tears his gloves off with a giggle. he takes a pen from the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. he shoves the pen in veronica's hand and grabbing her hand, forces her to scribble life sucks on the paper.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{perfecto. man, i've even got a marked up catcher in the rye. what else does a suicide need?}
<A>__{j.d. pulls out the copy of the catcher in the rye and opens a door revealing heather duke, asleep in an artful pose on a couch, mtv images from the t.v. flashing against her.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(raising the knife)}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me......}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no o!}
<A>__{j.d. hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door. veronica races to the door wailing. she maniacally rattles the doorknob trying to open the locked door.}
