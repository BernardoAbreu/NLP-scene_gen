<L>__{exterior forest clearing night}
<A>__{a lantern sits on a rock. on a blanket, a semi naked man and semi naked woman are in the midst of rough sex. ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush. the couple keeps coupling, with the man on top. his grunts and gasps are particularly desperate. he's all over the woman, who lays back... it is lady van tassel. ichabod swallows, inches closer. lady van tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh. she raises a small, sharp knife behind his back. ichabod's eyes widen. lady van tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep in her palm. blood flows. she rubs her cut hand over her partner's arching back, smearing blood. lady van tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face... trailing blood. the man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks the woman's bloody fingers... it's clergyman steenwyck. ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.}
