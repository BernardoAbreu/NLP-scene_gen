<A>__{robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. a dozen romulans at controls. robau does his level best to portray confidence as he is led up a walkway to ayel. behind him, sitting silhouetted and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. a presence always felt in this scene. this is nero. ayel touches a panel, then throws an image into the air before robau. a rotating hologram of a unique looking spacecraft (we will refer to it as the jellyfish).}

<C>__{captain robau}
<P>__{(the fuck?)}
<D>__{... stardate? ... it's 2233.04.}
