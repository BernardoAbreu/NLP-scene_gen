<L>__{interior barn day}
<B>__{empty cages stacked along a wooden wall}
<A>__{a young kitten in a cardboard box wrestling with the barrel of a .44. a thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cat's neck and backbone. rudy butler is preoccupied with the cat, giving little attention to the thirtyish man standing nearby. harold clinton puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag. rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn like animal hospital. the large room is lined with stalls, cages and pens, many of them vacant. the wonded criminal is bare chested. a plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder. fran clinton sits on a high wooden stool opposite rudy. five years younger than her husband, tight sweater and skirt, bright scarlet fingernail polish, well built, her face suggests sensuality. fran's bare, milk white legs are crossed under her rumpled skirt.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{what's the damage?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{collar bone is broken. no infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i got a nurse in mind.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(going along, oblivious to the implication)}
<D>__{the glucose will begin working in half an hour. you'll feel better then...}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(flashing a grin despite the pain)}
<D>__{the three of us are going to do some traveling. we're going to take your car to el paso.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{that's not possible. we can't leave here... we've got all this.}
<A>__{rudy smiles at mrs. clinton. he's never met fran before, but he's known her for years.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{is it possible, mrs. clinton?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(scared, but trying to be friendly)}
<D>__{just... tell us what you want.}
<A>__{rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. the following silence is like a scream. finally:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what kind of car do you have, harold?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{a ford... we have a ford.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{that's good. that's very good. now harold, you go out and gas up the ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. one more thing... if anybody but you comes back...}
<A>__{he points the gun at mrs. clinton.}
<C>__{rudy }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she gets her clock fixed right away... you understand that, harold?}
<A>__{a long pause.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{you do what he says, harold.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{after you come back i will listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... you have to call another vet about the animals. you tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip ups on that. they got to be looked after...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we really don't have too many friends.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{they don't think he married well.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that makes things a little easier for us then, doesn't it?}
