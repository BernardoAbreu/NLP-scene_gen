<L>__{exterior ike's car country road night}
<A>__{ike and maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{your filter's clogged. this takes unleaded.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{can you fix it?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{first i have to find some tools. i need a half and a nine six tenth.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(removing his glasses)}
<A>__{of what?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(in amazement)}
<A>__{wrenches. my dad's gonna love that one. maggie slams the food closed.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{kind of isolated.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yeah. it's kind of nice. an uncomfortable silent pause. ike breaks the moment.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{there's one thing we new yorkers know how to do is hail a cab. if there's no cab, we walk. ike stares off down the road. maggie indicates a building in the distance, then turns off the car lights.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i can get some tools over there.... and save the battery... there's one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field. it's quicker. maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle. he smiles and follows her into the field.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{be careful of snakes.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{snakes? are you serious? i don't like snakes. i've never even seen a snake. he steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward maggie.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{maggie leads ike through a cornfield.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{do you think there's only one right person for everybody? ike chooses his words carefully.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no. but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. attraction is very misleading. and if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yes it is. and it doesn't mean anything. ike nods as they come to a wooden fence. she puts her hand on his shoulder. ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a boost over the top. we see the flicker of misunderstanding cross maggie's face at the initial contact. neither of them moves forward or back, but the electricity is obvious. angle on: ike. his conflicted feelings are apparent. with difficulty, maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove their hands.}
<C>__{maggie }
<P>__{(lightly)}
<A>__{i suddenly forgot how to climb a fence. they look at each other for a moment, then:}
<C>__{maggie and ike}
<P>__{(breaking the moment jokingly)}
<A>__{"tools". she climbs over the fence on her own and ike follows. they see an old guy, lionel, whittling on a porch.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{lionel, can i borrow some tools?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{yeah, we need a half and nine sixteenths.}
<C>__{lionel}
<A>__{gonna bust out of another wedding?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you're sure well known around here.}
