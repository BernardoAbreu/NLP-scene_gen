<A>__{back to meeting room. phillip stands frozen before steven}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{funny, huh?}
<A>__{the guard pushes phillip past the threshold. the door slams shut behind him. he staggers toward steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions plays across his face. bewilderment, relief, sorrow, joy and finally, anger whack! he slaps steven across the face.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{you're such a fucker!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i know i'm sorry you weren't supposed to find out.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{well i did!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i couldn't take a chance telling you. you know that. i couldn't. but phillip, i only did it so i could get here to you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{just to talk to you. and here i am.}
<A>__{phillip tries to take this to heart. after a moment...}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{you're so skinny.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i'm fine. just hungry.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{steven i don't }
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{wait. listen. i just came here to tell you one thing and that's it. you don't have to take me back, i just want to say one thing.}
<A>__{phillip is listening.}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{i know you thought we were nothing but a lie but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real. i thought about what you said to me. you said you don't know who i am. but i have to tell you i know now. i know who i am. i mean i'm not a lawyer, i'm not a cfo, i'm not a cop. hell i'm not even an escape artist. those steven russells are dead. and now, all that's left is the man that loves you. that's all. nothing else. i'm just the man that loves you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{and if you can see that... believe it... then i promise i will never be anything else ever again.}
<A>__{a long, long silence. phillip looks to him.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{how do i know you're not bullshitting me again?}
<A>__{steven pauses. he looks phillip square in the eye.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{you don't.}
<A>__{and as phillip stares at him }
