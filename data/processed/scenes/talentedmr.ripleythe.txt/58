<L>__{exterior mid ocean. day.}
<A>__{the bay of san remo. dickie and ripley have hired a motor boat.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{that's how i found my place in mongi. took a boat out round the bay. the first place i liked, i got it.}
<A>__{the motor boat is ploughing the waves. dickie exhilarated by the speed.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{dickie, slow down, come on!}
<A>__{ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. dickie cuts the motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(ecstatic)}
<D>__{i love it here! gonna live here!}
<A>__{dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming buddy rich.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you my plan.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{so tell me.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i thought i might come back. in the new year. under my own steam.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(suddenly tight)}
<D>__{really? to italy?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{of course. let's say, for argument's sake, you were here perhaps we could split the rent on a house i will get a job or, better still, i could get a place in rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here }
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{oh god, i don't think so.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{ you see, particularly with the marge problem, you can just blame me.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{marge and i are getting married.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. it's absurd.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i love marge.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you love me and you're not marrying me.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{tom, i don't love you.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no, no, it's not a threat, i've explained all of that.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. i think we've seen enough of each other for a while.}
<A>__{ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{you can be a leech you know this and it's boring. you can be quite boring.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(volcanic)}
<D>__{the funny thing i'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. i'm absolutely honest with you. i've told you my feelings. but you, first of all i know there's something that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious }
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{what evening?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{sure i know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a and now you're getting married! i'm bewildered, forgive me...you're lying to marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, dickie, what do you really play?}
<A>__{dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards ripley.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(attacking him, administering}
<D>__{tiny slaps as punctuation to}
<P>__{his tirade)}
<D>__{who are you some imposter, some third class mooch who are you to tell me anything? actually, i really really really don't want to be on this boat with you, i can't move without you moving, which is exactly how it feels and it gives me the creeps.}
<P>__{(he goes to rev up the engine)}
<D>__{i can't move without "dickie, dickie, dickie" like a little girl. you give me the }
<B>__{ripley smashes him across the head with the oar. dickie slips}
<A>__{off the wooden seat, his eyes rolling in groggy surprise.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{shut up! just shut up! just shut up!}
<A>__{the boat slows as dickie releases the tiller. dickie looks up at ripley wearily and slides onto his back.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{for god's sake.}
<A>__{ripley, shocked at himself, goes to dickie, rocking the boat, catches him up, then is horrified to see dickie's face, apparently unmarked, suddenly split open, a line of blood and then a peeling like a fruit bursting. ripley's appalled. a terrible roar issues from dickie as he launches himself at ripley.}
<C>__{dickie }
<D>__{i will kill you!}
<A>__{ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar, kicking off dickie's hand around his ankle. the boat is rocking and swerving crazily as dickie falls against the tiller. ripley almost loses his balance. his glasses come off. they struggle, locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar. dickie's blinded by his own blood, loses his grip. ripley, terrified, hits dickie again and again, the oar like a carpet beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood on ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath, letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's let it rest in a pool of blood. he starts to sob, sprawls there, sobbing, next to dickie, horrified by what he's done. nobody's in sight. the boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves. ripley lies by dickie in the bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted. the pretty blue and white boat rocks peacefully. the sea calms.}
