<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{open the fucking door!}
<A>__{the sub lurches again, coming to a stop. the compartment is totally silent, as they begin ascending to the surface. on harry smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at norman. the sub lurches again, and we hear clanking metal. the hatch door opens. and arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and out the hatch door.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{anybody else?}
<A>__{silence. the hatch door locks, loudly. the sub lurches, and begins descending.}
