<L>__{exterior metropolitian museum night}
<A>__{the camera is close up on the illustrated banner over the main entrance. the banner reads; "treasures of the loc nar coming july 8th". we pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding. it is the goateed professor from the desert. his daughter runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.}

<A>__{father!}
<B>__{professor}
<A>__{run! the girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser guns come out and start firing. a fat, evil looking man (rudnick) bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.}
<B>__{rudnick}
<A>__{(to henchmen) he's dead. get the girl! the girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as harry's cab comes cruising by. she runs alongside, pounding on the window.}
<B>__{girl}
<A>__{(to harry) help me, please!! a laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts harry's side mirror. harry flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves her in.}
<B>__{harry}
<A>__{(v.o.) normally my rule is "don't get involved", but something about this dame got to me. she dives in the back and harry floors it. the cab screams away as laser shots land all around.}
<B>__{girl}
<A>__{(in shock, breathless) the loc nar ... they wanted it ... but my father wouldn't tell them ... now i'm the only one ...}
