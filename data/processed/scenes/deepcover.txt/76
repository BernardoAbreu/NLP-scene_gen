<L>__{exterior a salsa club night}
<A>__{music pouring into the darkness.}
<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{kids dancing to a live stage act. high in a wall: a lit window.}
<L>__{interior that room night}
<A>__{very different from the club. a comfortable room with a bar, tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below. barbosa and gopher at the bar with elias and hull. chino and other shadowy figures lurk in the room's depths.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{ten kilos? you're always late on two.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{not ten... twenty.}
<A>__{barbosa's impressed.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the more we have, the more we can move. there're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory.}
<A>__{barbosa's coked to the eyeballs, mean and dangerous.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{finally some balls on this team...}
<P>__{(taunting elias)}
<D>__{come work for me, john. i will give you your own franchise. you can supply elias, lean on him when he's late.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{barbosa laughs.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i'm with david.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{why? he give you his "designer drugs" pitch. he's never going to do it. he's a shmuck.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{don't talk to me that way.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{i'm not talking to you at all. i'm talking to john.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{it's the cocaine. don't listen to him. felix, you've had enough...}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{shmuck.}
<A>__{elias goes for him. he's fast and strong, and it takes chino and hull to pull him off.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{praise god they don't let guns in here.}
<C>__{calming voices}
<D>__{"none of that in here..." "take it outside..."}
<A>__{barbosa's laughing, but his cheek is flecked with his own blood, and his eyes are dead.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{david, you've been working out, you're getting strong. are you quick, too?}
<P>__{(shadow boxes)}
<D>__{come on, i will give you a shot at me.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{any time, any place.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{right here, right now. do this.}
<A>__{he puts his hands out, palms up.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{this? what is this?}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{you know, you slap me, i slap you.}
<P>__{(mimes that game)}
<D>__{come on, it's fun. like summer camp.}
<A>__{it doesn't look fun. elias glances at hull for guidance.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{don't waste your time.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{stay out of this.}
<P>__{(to elias)}
<D>__{come on, you can do it, david, you're not a shmuck.}
<A>__{elias puts his hands out, palms up. barbosa covers them with his own. on the hands: barbosa's broad, muscular with thick gold rings and a rolex; elias's paler, slighter, a wedding band and a slim watch.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{slap my hands. just slap them.}
<A>__{elias looks barbosa in the eye. he's trying to be a snake, but he's more the mouse. he looks away and as he does tries to... slap him with both hands but hits only... air. the room breathes. barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now it's my turn.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{it's barbosa's turn. he's gonna kill the white boy.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{one more.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{no, you went, davey, now it's my turn. first to four wins, like the world series.}
<A>__{elias covers barbosa's palms with his own.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{oh, god, i can't look.}
<A>__{on the hands: barbosa tenses his hands. elias yanks back. barbosa's hands haven't moved.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{you remember the rules? if you flinch, i get to hit you.}
<A>__{he slaps elias across the face. hull starts forward. a knife appears. he stops.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{again, shmuck.}
<A>__{elias covers barbosa's hands. barbosa tenses. elias holds firm, and barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. elias doubles over, holding his hands in pain.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{one.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{that was two.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{no, this is two.}
<A>__{he slaps him again, a stinging crack. elias looks to hull, but they're across a canyon. hull lowers his eyes.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{oh, and it hurts. mercy, it hurts.}
<A>__{on the hands. barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and elias flinches again. barbosa smacks him across the face. the sound reverberates through the room. now even gopher is silent. tears run from elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he doesn't move.}
<C>__{gopher}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{three.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{felix! no mas. finito.}
<B>__{a man}
<A>__{steps forward out of the shadows. he is young, mid 30's, handsome, european features, beautifully dressed, accompanied by a guard we'll know as molto. someone murmurs to someone else:}
<C>__{someone}
<D>__{gallegos...}
<A>__{hull reacts. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{the fight is over! the ambassador from the south has spoken!}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(refusing any mercy)}
<D>__{one more.}
<A>__{barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of gallegos.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{one more! we're not finished!}
<P>__{(people are silent)}
<D>__{four was the match.}
<A>__{he holds out his hands. barbosa resumes the stance, then waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{four.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{okay, that's it. get away.}
<A>__{hull leads elias to the door right past gallegos. their gazes meet again. as they go out they hear gallegos berating barbosa in furious spanish.}
