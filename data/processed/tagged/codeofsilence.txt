<L>__{1985 exterior chicago night to dawn}
<A>__{thundering north through the glass canyons of the loop, the elevated train screeches through the city awakening. as it races north across the river past ancient factories giving way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life in the morning. on the near north side an assortment of revelers are winding up their night on the town. the pressmen loiter outside the tribune loading docks, and fishing boats are outbound through the chicago river locks. a streetsweeping crew moves through the fulton market, chicago's central meat and produce distribution center. at the merchandise mart platform the elevated train picks up two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.}
<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{the el train rumbles north past the aging tenements of uptown into the belmont avenue station. and down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up the alley. a garbage man in city overalls whistles to the driver and the truck stops. he rolls a can to the grinding jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street. there's something odd about this driver. and the garbage man too, for that matter.}
<L>__{exterior el platform day}
<A>__{spider, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the platform. as the train pulls away we see him reach into his shirt pocket and clicks his ball point pen a couple of times. he whispers into it. it is a concealed radio transmitter.}
<C>__{spider}
<D>__{say, hey, cub fans, i hope to hell y'all down there cause we got a big game today.}
<A>__{he heads for the stairs and the street below.}
<L>__{interior truck cab day}
<A>__{the truck cab is equipped with a police radio. the driver, rich donato, adjusts the volume. over the speaker, heavy with static, we can hear the sound of the receding el train.}

<L>__{exterior el station day}
<A>__{at the corner in a beat up pontiac are officers music and brennan. the two rough looking detectives follow doc's car through half closed eyes. they also hear spider's transmitter. the quality of the reception improves as spider and his antennae clear the steel support structure of the el platform.}

<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from the el. cragie, a weathered twenty five year veteran; and nick kosalas, the new kid on the team. cragie sits on a crate with a styrofoam cup of coffee. kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off, and still hold on to his walkie talkie.}

<D>__{we real cool, doc. we're frosty. we jus' doin' a little business, you know? ain't no big thing.}
<A>__{the two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement. they pass through a gangway to the front of the building, and climb the front stairs. though we can no longer see them, we hear a door opening, a greeting in spanish, and feet founding up the steps. the garbage truck grinds forward and halts again. eddie comes up to the cab. he is wearing a gun under his overalls. he and donato listen on the radio to the conversation coming from inside the building.}
<L>__{interior comacho front stairs day}
<A>__{a muscular latino, pompas comacho, leads spider and doc down the paint peeling corridor. the sound of babies crying and families waking gives a sense of teeming humanity behind every door. the latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar bars. the door opens. the bars are unlocked.}

<L>__{exterior comacho street day}
<A>__{as music and brennan watch from their car, the four painters get out of their truck, unpack their ladders and tools, and begin to carry their equipment into the building next door to the stakeout.}
<L>__{interior comacho apartment day}
<A>__{the room is small and bare. a selling den. victor comacho and two cousins, all young and vicious, are sitting around a formica table with the two buyers, doc and spider. the comachos are heavily armed. there is plenty of tension all around, but doc seems a little more nervous than the rest. this is an enormous buy. doc has placed a bowling satchel full of bundled $20's, $50's, and $100's on the table. victor is counting it rapidly.}
<C>__{spider}
<D>__{this be better than jukin' seven elevens, huh victor?}

<D>__{i don't juke anybody.}
<A>__{victor nods and one of the cousins brings in half a dozen brick sized bundles of cocaine from the next room. doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife he drops a bit into a glass vial. he adds clear liquid with an eye dropper and it instantly turns purple.}

<L>__{interior painter's apartment day}
<A>__{the painters are not what they seem. working quickly, silently, they open their tool kits and lay out their hardware: machine guns and automatics. tony luna, a barrel chested italian mobster is running the show and it's well rehearsed. his boys, gus, vito, and eenie move like oiled machinery. vito turns on a radio to a latino station to cover the sound of their preparations. they remove the whole window from its frame. then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge. three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and silhouetted against the shade we can see the drug deal. luna'ys check their weapons. they put on painters' masks and goggles.}
<C>__{luna}
<D>__{okay, by the numbers.}

<L>__{interior painter's apartment day}
<A>__{tony and his men face the window across the gangway. two of them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns. tony counts it down, and they all fire as one. one giant blast tears into the window. it disintegrates. the four men toss aside their empty guns, and grab other guns.}
<L>__{exterior gangway day}
<A>__{eddie hears the gunfire and hits the wall. he sees the glass showering down around him. he vaults over the backyard fence and head for the porch stairs.}

<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<A>__{cragie is using the crate to climb the wall. he is up and over, and falls to the ground on the other side. he's still trying to get to his feet when kosalas comes over. they start running, yanking their guns out.}

<A>__{doc and spider are blown backwards in their chairs. one of the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs. victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor. the woman in the bedroom is screaming. through the jagged glass around the window frame, tony's boys shove a broad plank.}

<A>__{three floors up, we see the "painters" rush across the gangway to the other building.}
<L>__{exterior comacho back stairs day}
<A>__{efren comacho, the heavyweight guarding the back door, is distracted by the shouts and gunfire upstairs. eddie crashes through the door and efren spins just in time to meet eddie's blurring attack. the struggle on the landing is brief. efren's size is no match for eddie's speed and power. with a grunt he sags to the floor. eddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps.}
<L>__{exterior comacho street day}
<A>__{brennan, music and kobas are now on their way, using parked cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the comacho building.}
<L>__{exterior comacho back stairs day}
<A>__{eddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look up the porch stairs. the door to the second floor apartment starts to open behind him. he spins and kicks it. there stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of his gun.}

<D>__{police! no se mueve!}
<A>__{he spins and bounds up the stairway.}
<L>__{interior comacho apartment day}
<A>__{the woman is huddled in a corner, still screaming. tony comes to stand over her, and coldly shoots her. then he rips off his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop up the drugs and money from the table. victor comacho lies slumped against the wall, one side of his face and one shoulder bloodied. he appears dead, eyes open. but then he blinks once.}
<L>__{interior comacho back stairs day}
<A>__{eddie has entered the rear of the apartment. he moves cautiously forward.}
<L>__{interior comacho apartment day}
<A>__{tony and his partners start back over the gangway to the other building. vito is bringing up the rear. suddenly victor comacho comes to life. he gets off a burst with his automatic. vito catches it in the back.}

<A>__{donato is moving down the gangway when vito's body followed by the scaffold plank falls from the sky and crashes into the pavement right in front of him.}
<L>__{interior comacho apartment day}
<A>__{eddie jumps into the living room doorway, gun drawn, and takes in the carnage. he kicks the gun out of victor's hand, and bounds to the shattered bay window and looks down in time to see }

<D>__{they're goin out the front!}
<L>__{interior comacho apartment day}
<A>__{the bridge to the other building is gone, but there is a large drainpipe running down the outside of the building. eddie climbs out on the shattered window sill, and stretches for the pipe. the pipe is just out of reach. pushing off from the ledge, he jumps for the drainpipe, grabbing it on his way down.}

<L>__{exterior comacho street day}
<A>__{luna pulls out peeling rubber, but he's nearly surrounded. squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street. another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump out and start firing. luna hits the fender of the squad car head on, knocking both officers to the ground. he spins the van around with cops firing from every angle, jumps the curb, and roars past the roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all directions.}

<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{the van hurtles down the alley, splashing through puddles past the loading docks of a packing company. parked along one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the opening montage. a loading ramp leads to the gaping rear doors. the thieves have done their homework. the luna gang slams up the ramp into the rear of the meat truck. a bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butcher's smock pulls several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck. with the van concealed, the line of police cars roar splashing by.}

<A>__{a block later the cadillac heads topside again. eddie takes a gamble and goes straight ahead. at the next down ramp, the cadillac descends and tony's boys find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with eddie in the other lane. in the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.}
