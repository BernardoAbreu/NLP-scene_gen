<A>__{sam carrying the paper down up the stairs to an old house that's being renovated. jonah, who is playing cameboy, is walking along with him. workmen are active everywhere. dry wall going up, cabinets being installed, tile being set. one of sam's partners, bob langman, is walking with him, and jay mathews, the on site supervisor, is waiting for them in an unfinished doorframe. bob is hefty, older, always eating something dietetic. jay is younger and always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.}
<C>__{bob langman}
<D>__{now she wants a circular stairwell off the den.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to jonah, in b.g.)}
<D>__{punch me, punch in right here.}
<P>__{(points to his stomach; jonah punches)}
<D>__{and she wants the sub zero with the side by side doors }
<C>__{bob}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{grace the dispatcher. great.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why me? what about jay?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey, my plate is full.}
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh, you're changing your mind }
<C>__{jonah}

<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{dad }
<A>__{sam cuffs him good naturedly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we better take the measurements for the new cabinets.}
<A>__{he walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc. and starts checking the cross beams in the ceiling over in another area of the site. bob follows after him. jay tosses jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into the wall.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sam, if you're not doing anything new year's obviously you're not doing anything new year's we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around. does that sound great or what?}

<D>__{i can't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thanks, but i will pass. it's kind of a big night. i don't like to leave jonah alone.}
