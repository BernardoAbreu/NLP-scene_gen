<L>__{exterior suburban street in queens. day.}
<A>__{truman drives erratically down a quiet suburban street. on the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a young mother pushing an infant in a baby carriage. truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk. he has the driver's door open almost before the oldsmobile has come to a halt. truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot. the startled infant immediately begins to wail as truman holds the crying bundle in both hands above his head.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(to the mother, motioning to the sidewalk)}
<D>__{say my name or i will smash its head open.}
<A>__{the young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(vehement)}
<D>__{say my name!}
<C>__{young mother}
<P>__{(composing herself, reaching out for her child)}
<D>__{please, give him to me...}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(screaming above the baby's cries)}
<D>__{say my name! you know my name! say it!}
<C>__{young mother}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{i don't know you.}
<A>__{the commotion has attracted the attention of an old man across the street, watering his garden. he drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas. halfway across the street, the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in the air.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{i mean it! i'm ready to do it! what's my name?!!}
<A>__{truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can, his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete. we see a view of the scene from the pov of a streetlight. the young mother, recognizing truman's seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes)}
<D>__{this is your last chance!}
<A>__{the anguish in his voice convinces us that truman is truly on the brink. the young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks. she is at a loss, powerless.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(his entire body shaking)}
<D>__{what...is...my... name?!}
<A>__{the young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name. truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go through with it. with everything he has, he gathers himself. after what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.}
<C>__{young mother}
<P>__{(clutching the baby to her breast, without thinking)}
<D>__{thank you, truman.}
<A>__{truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat. he jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street. the young woman and the old man stare after truman's car as it roars away.}
