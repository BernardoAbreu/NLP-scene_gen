<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the road's turned to dirt and the plateau into a maze of ragged cliffs and brutally hacked canyons. the light is shadowy and golden now as katherine's pickup turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic butte. higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes upon}
<B>__{the village}
<A>__{perched frighteningly on the leading edge of old woman butte, this is the home of the bitter sky clan. the village is a small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a thousand years ago by the anasazi. there's no electricity here, no tv antennas or frozen yogurt. just the slow curl of cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, deeply lined face of an old navaho man approaching the pickup as katherine stops. the old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. he holds in his right hand a small leather case.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i am bartholomew grey horse, born to the deer spring clan, born for the slow talking people. today i am the yataalii for mary tsosie of the bitter sky clan.}
<A>__{the old man, bartholomew grey horse, walks up to mary and her grandmother sitting in the bed.}
<C>__{grey horse}
<D>__{ya tah.}
<C>__{grandmother}
<D>__{ya tah hey.}
<A>__{several villagers approach and greet mary and her grandmother, some nodding politely to thomas and katherine as they climb out of the cab. nearly all of them are elderly. thomas, one eye still half shut by a bandage, walks over to the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to the desert floor. he leans against it and gazes out on a view that must encompass half the world. in all directions, for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, ominous playthings. a village truly alone in the world.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this is a good place.}
<A>__{she's appeared beside him. thomas crouches down to her level and smiles.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{mary's sight is on the view, eyeing it critically.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{separate water source. stocked grain. only one possible approach. a man could, with the proper defenses, hold off an entire battalion for weeks. months.}
<A>__{thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through her hair.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{which one of you is that talking, mary? or do you even know anymore?}
<A>__{mary's eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and leads her back to the adobe hogans. grey horse, the yataalii, is there now.}
<C>__{grey horse}
<D>__{we will start the sing soon to remove the yei spirit and stop the ghost sickness.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{this might not be the work of a navaho ghost.}
<C>__{grey horse}
<D>__{it's all the same.}
