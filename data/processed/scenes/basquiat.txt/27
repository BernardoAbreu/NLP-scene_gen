<A>__{through a steamy, rain wet window, we see jean and gina seated at a table, dining. they seem to be having a nice time.}
<L>__{interior gina's apartment next morning}
<A>__{gina lays in bed. daylight streams into the apartment. jackhammers rattle outside. (music: reggae song errol scorcher's "cockroach in de corner.")}
<L>__{extreme closeup}
<A>__{a cockroach crawls from gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing. it crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box. jean rummages through a cabinet. he finds a can of bugspray. jean tears off a side of the box. with cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach. he's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can. someone pounds furiously at the door. ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.}

<D>__{why didn't you say so? damn! she's asleep!}
<A>__{jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. he hands it to the landlady. it's a a little shack with a big head next to it that says "'here' for rent." the landlady looks at him like he's crazy. she balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket. gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. the landlady's trapped between them.}
