<L>__{interior small, beat up church day}
<A>__{at a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second hand clothes under the watchful eye of mrs. coleman, a stout and charitable woman. next to her, mrs. dlamini hands out a lollipop and says }
<C>__{mrs. dlamini}
<D>__{god bless you.}
<A>__{ to each kid. the clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by mrs. dlamini's "god bless yous". the last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only one small boy (sipho) left and only one article of clothing. an old springbok rugby practise jersey. green and gold. sipho could use it. his clothes are more holes than anything else. he looks at the springbok jersey mournfully.}
<C>__{mrs. coleman}
<D>__{you're a very lucky boy. it's a real springbok practise jersey! it's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever!}
<A>__{sipho shakes his head.}
<C>__{mrs. coleman}
<D>__{it's yours, take it! go on.}
<A>__{sipho turns and leaves. mrs. coleman looks at mrs. dlamini, completely confused.}
<C>__{mrs. coleman}
<D>__{why won't he take it?}
<C>__{mrs. dlamini}
<D>__{if he wears it, the others will beat him up.}
<C>__{mrs. coleman}
<D>__{because the springboks are playing so badly?}
<C>__{mrs. dlamini}
<D>__{no. because, for them, the springboks still represent apartheid.}
