<L>__{interior my 1955 pontiac morning}
<A>__{driving, running parallels to avoid fed tails. no black buicks...but a gray packard shifts behind me on a cadence.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{noonan replaced the buick with a packard and a better shadow man. but i could still spot the tail.}
<A>__{run a red light at rossmore, leave the packard behind.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) this jet engine urge to see her. needing it like a junkie does. no logic. just the push.}
<A>__{driving past glenda's house now. no corvette. driving past the griffith park `vampires' set: addicts crew rolling up sleeping bags. no corvette. pull the address list dandy handed me: talent domiciles. pasadena. howard's fuck pad supreme: a tudor mansion with airplane shaped hedges. a corvette in the drive. stop at the curb. open shades. flashes of her. gathering something. check my hamilton, look up as: knock knock on my window. her face, inches close. bags of groceries in her hands and this wry little smile: watch me kill hughes's new dick with kindness. roll the window down, stay blank slate. she features my cuts bruises. her quiet, deep voice is like medicine:}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{better looking than the last guy howard hired. once you heal.}
<P>__{(she recognizes me)}
<D>__{wait a minute. you were there, the other night, the bethune party...}
<A>__{my heart jammed up into my throat. push past it.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{glenda}
<D>__{mickey told me this `bent cop' everybody used to call }
<P>__{(mocking, i love it:)}
<D>__{ `the enforcer' was asking about me. told me to be careful. so you're lapd after all...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{in theory.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{you're going to arrest me for breaking and entering?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{depends.}
<P>__{(nod to groceries)}
<D>__{those howard's?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}

<D>__{except you.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{that's why i left.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you just shop here now?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{some of our extras haven't had a vegetable since truman.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{attack of the atomic vampires...}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<P>__{(smiles, no flinch)}
<D>__{we can't all be audrey hepburn. plus it pays bills.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{better than a billionaire does? go make amends and finish out your service contract ms. bledsoe.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{not if there was just one day left on it.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{i'm better than that.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you're also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that'll never see a screen, regardless if it's leading lady gets `kidnapped' or not.}
<A>__{drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. she's beat, but bluffs by.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}

<D>__{and tell howard i will take my chances with the fake vampires.}
