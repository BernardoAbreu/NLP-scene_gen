<D>__{it was incomprehensible. what was god up to? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god's gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married! and no rebuke at all! was it possible i was being tested? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? that was very possible. all the same, why him? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts. i couldn't stop them.}
