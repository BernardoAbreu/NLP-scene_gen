<A>__{carter goes to the edge and sees lee hanging on a pole below. carter is blind sided by hu li. she takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel and windmills a hard kick that sends carter flying off the roof! he falls along the side of the building. he manages to grab the end of a bamboo pole that juts out from the scaffolding. lee is right there next to him! they're hanging side by side, holding on for their lives. hu li looks down at them. she has no weapon to finish them off. she turns and runs, disappearing in the night.}
