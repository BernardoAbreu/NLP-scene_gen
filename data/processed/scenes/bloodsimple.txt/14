<L>__{exterior phone booth day}
<A>__{a huge truck roars by on the street behind visser, and with it the deafening rumble recedes. it is a painfully bright day. visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the receiver pressed to his ear. we hear the phone ringing at the other end. finally, it is picked up.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{marty?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah. is it...}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{ya catch any fish?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...what?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{ya catch any fish?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...what kind of fish?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{listen, what is it? is it done?}
<A>__{visser forces a chuckle.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...yessir, you owe me some money.}
<A>__{marty's office night}
<B>__{close shot two strings of fish}
<A>__{being plopped down onto marty's desk.}
<B>__{wider the office}
<A>__{visser sits facing the desk. he lights himself a cigarette and sets the lighter down on the desk in front of him. marty settles, fidgeting, into the chair behind it. the bar is quiet, shut down. we hear only the whir of a fan somewhere offscreen. marty and visser are lit by a lamp on the desk between them. light streams into the room from a bathroom in the background. visser is looking at the dead fish.}
<C>__{visser}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{they look good.}
<A>__{marty half rises from his seat and picks up one of the strings.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{want a couple?}
<A>__{he drops them on visser's side of the desk. visser's head draws back: he was only being polite.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{just the ten thousand'll be fine.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{got something to show me first?}
<A>__{visser hands a 9 x 12 envelope across the desk. marty stares at it for a moment, then quickly bends back the flap and takes out an 8 x 10 photograph.}
<B>__{the photograph}
<A>__{it is a black and white shot of abby and ray in ray's bed. the sheet that partially covers them is pocked with three dark bullet holes and is stained with blood.}
<B>__{marty}
<A>__{staring dully down at the picture.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{dead, huh?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{so it would seem.}
<B>__{close shot the top of the desk}
<A>__{visser is pushing the fish away from his side of the desk with the eraser end of a pencil.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what did you...}
<B>__{back to marty}
<A>__{still looking at the picture. he traces the outline of abby's body with his finger.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...what did you do with the bodies?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{it's taken care of. the less you know about it the better.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{jesus, i don't believe it...}
<A>__{marty slips the picture back into its 9 x 12 envelope. his face is pale.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...i think i'm gonna be sick.}
<A>__{he rises and heads for the bathroom, still clutching the envelope.}
<B>__{close shot visser}
<A>__{as his eyes follow marty's exit. the bathroom door doesn't close all the way; a narrow shaft of light slices the office from the bare bulb in the bathroom.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{i will want that picture back...}
<A>__{he turns to look across the desk. visser's pov the standing safe behind the desk.}
<B>__{back to visser}
<A>__{still looking at the safe. beads of sweat have popped out on his forehead. he fans himself with his cowboy hat.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...and you did say somethin' about some money.}
<A>__{we hear a toilet flush offscreen. long shot marty's office as he reenters the office.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{your money, yeah.}
<A>__{visser stares dully down at the desktop.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{something i got to ask you, marty. i've been very very careful. have you been very very careful?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{nobody knows you hired me?}
<B>__{high angle corner of the office}
<A>__{marty is hunched over the open safe, still holding the envelope. blocking visser's view of the safe with his body, he slides the picture of abby's and ray's corpses from under the envelope into the safe, then withdraws two packets of money.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{don't be absurd, i wasn't about to tell anyone...}
<A>__{he shuts the safe and spins the dial.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...this is an illicit romance we've got to trust each other to be discreet...}
<A>__{he walks across the room and throws the money and the envelope down on the desk.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...for richer, for poorer.}
<A>__{visser looks from the money down at his hands. they are sweating.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{don't say that. your marriages don't work out so hot...}
<A>__{he wipes his hands on his pants.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...how did you cover the money?}
<A>__{marty sits and props his booted feet up on the desk.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{it's taken care of. the less you know about it the better.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...i just made a call about that. it'll look fine.}
<C>__{visser}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i must've gone money simple. this kind of murder...}
<A>__{he nods toward the envelope on the desk.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...it's too damn risky.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{then you shouldn't have done it. can't have it both ways.}
<A>__{he pushes the money across the desk with his boot.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...count it if you want.}
<C>__{visser}
<P>__{(reaching into his coat)}
<D>__{nah, i trust ya.}
<A>__{his hand comes out with a gun pointing at marty and bam he fires, an orange lick of flame spurting from the gun. both men sit frozen. visser's hand is the only thing that moved.}
<B>__{close shot marty}
<A>__{staring at visser. after the gun blast we hear only the whir of the fan.}
<B>__{close shot visser}
<A>__{staring at marty. med shot marty over visser's shoulder his eyes are now shut. otherwise he hasn't moved. a blood stain is growing on the front of his shirt.}
<B>__{wide shot the office}
<A>__{the two face each other across the desk. visser's gun is still trained on marty. after a moment visser starts fanning himself again with his cowboy hat. the only movement in the frame is the slow back and forth of the yellow hat, rhythmically in and out of shadow as it catches and loses the light from the desk lamp. there is a long pause. finally one of marty's feet slips from the desk and hits the floor with a thud. visser lays the gun on the desk.}
<B>__{close shot visser}
<A>__{as he reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a handkerchief. he wipes his forehead, then picks up the gun and wipes it off. he leans down with the gun.}
<B>__{close shot the gun}
<A>__{as visser places it deliberately on the floor near the desk. it is abby's pearl handled revolver.}
<B>__{the desktop from desk level}
<A>__{as visser straightens up in the foreground. from our head on angle shooting across the desk we can see the bright metallic glint of visser's cigarette lighter underneath the dead fish. visser's hands move over the near part of the desk, picking up the money and the 9 x 12 picture envelope.}
