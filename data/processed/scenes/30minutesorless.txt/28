<L>__{exterior radio tower night}
<A>__{the mustang parks at the end of the driveway. will gets out. there is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top of a small office structure. the office door is ajar. florescent light glows from inside.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{dwayne }
<P>__{(calling back from beyond door)}
<D>__{hey, bud! sorry for the hike! the county's got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night!}
<A>__{this puts will at ease. he heads toward the office. as he gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. it is dwayne}
<B>__{wearing a scary fucking gorilla mask}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the }
<A>__{will hears something behind him and whirls around to find jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{holy fuck!}
<A>__{will makes a run for it. but the guys are on top of him in no time. he madly fights them off and dashes for his car.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{stop! we got a gun, you asshole!}
<A>__{will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck! get him!}
<A>__{jay is right on will's tail. without breaking stride, jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him. will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around will's body.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the hell!?}
<P>__{(at a loss)}
<D>__{rape!}
<A>__{jay wrestles something from his pocket. a chloroform soaked rag. he presses it hard against will's mouth and nose. will soon goes limp. dwayne appears, looming above them. he pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{step one.}
