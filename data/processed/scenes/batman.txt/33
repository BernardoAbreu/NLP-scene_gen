<L>__{interior hallway that moment}
<A>__{two hoods run down a tiled corridor in the office section of the complex. they're almost at the end of the hall when a caped black shadow steps into their path. it stands there, motionless. extends its arms like giant wings revealing the yellow and black insigne on its massive chest. batman. one millisecond later, the shocked hoods are racing back in the opposite direction. the batman flings a handful of steel ball bearings across the tiled floor. hood i tumbles to the floor and lands hard, losing his breath. hood ii rolls and pulls a gun. batman hurls a boomerang its edges scalloped, like a bat's wing. hood ii finds his gun hand pinned to the wall by the twin prongs of the batarang. the batman strides briskly toward them, businesslike, taking his time. he grabs a handful of hood i's hair, lifts his head off the floor, knees him in the face. he turns to the petrified hood ii. chrome steel talons spring out of his fingertips. he strolls past hood ii, reaching out casually to give him a quick nick on the chin. hood ii slumps against the wall, unconscious.}
<B>__{angle on jack}
<A>__{down on the floor, racing along a wall, throwing switches anything to create a diversion. with every switch he throws, another gigantic machine roars to life. centrifuges spin. huge polymer extruders spit out thick strands of plastic gunk. overhead chemical tanks rotate into place over giant basins. jack sees a squad of cops on his tail, moving from machine to machine, keeping covered. he shoots and runs.}
<B>__{angle on catwalks}
<A>__{blasting away, hoods iii and iv scuttle across the elevated walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. one of them starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up. batman plunges past on the end of a rope. a black gloved hand snatches at hood iii's collar as he climbs and yanks him cleanly off the ladder. they drop to the lower catwalk. hood iv gapes. he levels his gun at batman, who stands his ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. a bullet hits him squarely in the chest. he does not fall. hood iv turns and scrambles. batman goes to his belt for a miniature spear gun. he points it at hood iv and fires... planting a barbed hook in the hood's leg.}
<B>__{angle on cops}
<A>__{staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{look!}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{my god... it's him.}
<B>__{angle on catwalk}
<A>__{hood iii, on his feet now, charges batman from behind. batman not even turning to face him drops hood iii with an elbow. now he has a hood on either side. he takes a steel billy club from his belt, whips it once through the air. it telescopes out into a four foot staff. like a drum majorette from hell, he whirls the staff as the hoods converge on him. hood iii takes a debilitating jab under the jaw. batman spins on his heels and slams the staff into hood iv's back knocking him off the catwalk to the factory floor forty feet below!}
