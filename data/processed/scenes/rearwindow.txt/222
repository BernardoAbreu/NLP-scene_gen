<A>__{thorwald coming out of his basement door, carrying a watering can. he fills it from a nearby faucet. he does not notice the little dog's destructive activities. when the watering can is filled, he straightens up, turns toward the flower bed. he stops for the briefest moment, when he sees the dog. he walks to the dog, gently lifts him out of the garden, and giving him a friendly little pat, sends him off. he proceeds to patiently brush back the disturbed earth, and then begins his watering.}
