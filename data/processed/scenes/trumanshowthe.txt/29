<L>__{exterior freeway. later that night.}
<A>__{truman and marlon wander down the empty freeway, retrieving the golf balls. as they return them to the bucket they check the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their long drive competition.}

<D>__{i'm serious.}
<A>__{where do the dreams go?}
<C>__{marlon}
