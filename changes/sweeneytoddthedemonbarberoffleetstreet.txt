<ACTION>__{Foreboding organ music is heard... We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... The ominous organ music continues as... From the bottom of the frame... A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. SUDDENLY-- A shrill factory whistle blows-- ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering -- the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream-- And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right side up as--}

JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars, humming to herself as she does needlepoint.

<DIAL>__{Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Hugging the blade, waiting the years, Hearing the music that nobody hears. Sweeney waits in the parlor hall, Sweeney leans on the office wall. No one can help, nothing can hide you-- Isn't that Sweeney there beside you? Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Is Sweeney! There he is, it's Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!}

<DIAL>__{... Street!}
<ACTION>__{The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand alone, continuing to glare at each other. Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into the darkness. He stands alone. And we cut to-- A series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music -- Todd's life flashing before his eyes -- The images building as the music races toward its conclusion-- Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding-- The final crash of music at the final image: Todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the bakehouse floor. He falls... Into the blood. Dead. Snap to black.}
