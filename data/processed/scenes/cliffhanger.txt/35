<L>__{exterior cabin day the back door}
<A>__{has come open and swings in the wind. gabe steps outside and pulls it shut. gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a small but sturdy shed a few yards away. gabe heads over to it.}
<L>__{interior shed day}
<A>__{not a storage shed at all it's a small workspace that offers solid protection from the elements, is well lit, and whistle clean. maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.}
<B>__{a large plastic cage}
<A>__{ inside is a bald eagle. one of maybe 2,000 left in the country. its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us it isn't nearly full grown. a bandage on its side tells us it's been injured. maggie's smile tells us it's healing.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{hey there }
<A>__{the door to the shed opens gabe steps in, and shuts the door behind him. maggie looks surprised to see him. gabe just looks awkward.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{could you introduce us?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{sure. gabe walker this is a27. a27 gabe.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{not the tag what do you call him?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{her. i call her lucky.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(bends down, eyes wound)}
<D>__{poachers?}
<P>__{(maggie nods)}
<D>__{bastards...}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{they got the mother and left this one behind. too small to make a decent trophy, i guess.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{about four months, right?}
<P>__{(maggie nods)}
<D>__{christ it must have been just about his i mean her first flight }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{time to change the dressing.}
<A>__{maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{you can't do that alone }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i've had to learn. she trust me }
<A>__{maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i'm making her nervous }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you hold her, i will do the dressing.}
<A>__{gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and alcohol in a drawer maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the cage, holding it firm. this is clearly something they've done many times before. they move together, tight gabe and maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage the eagle. it's getting warmer in here. gabe reaches down and yanks off the patch. the eagle thrashes as gabe cleans the wound.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{got some fight in her that's good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what happened to dave?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{the usual. flew off never calls, never writes }
<A>__{gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch and sticks it on the eagle's side. maggie puts the eagle back in the cage and closes the top door. gabe and maggie don't move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. gabe tentatively reaches for maggie's face but she pushes him hand away.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you, gabe. but i kind of wish you hadn't come. i was almost used to you being gone.}
<P>__{(beat, quiet)}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{i thought i came back to see if i'd learned to live with it. well, big surprise. coming back just tore me open all over again, like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago. nothing's changed. including the way i feel about you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't realize it till i saw you at the airport. but i came back for you, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{does that mean you're going to stay?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{no. not here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want you come with me. start over, somewhere else.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you come back after being gone a year, and you expect me to }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't live here any more, gabe. your choice, remember? but this is my home. i'm not leaving. you can stay with me, or you can go alone. it's still your choice.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{now there's an easy call.}
<A>__{standing in the shed's doorway is hal. stone faced. grim.}
<B>__{outside shed}
<A>__{furious, gabe heads out after hal.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{what the hell do you want?}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i need your help. a plane's gone down on comb bluff. this storm would blow a copter all over the place but we can climb up to it.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{"we"?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{talk to somebody who's still on the payroll. you've got a half dozen new guys }
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{ who couldn't climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it. but you've soloed it.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{during the summer. on a bet.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{this is a little more important than a bet. just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter, camping in a zero degree blizzard. they'll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{maybe you missed the headlines but i don't do rescues any more. they're bad for my conscience.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fuck this one up on your own.}
<A>__{gabe walks past hal. furious, hal spins gabe around.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{play it again, gabe, about how we killed her. i was there too, remember?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(hot)}
<D>__{not like i was, pal her fingers brushed mine on the way down }
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(right back)}
<D>__{ and i was the one who had to deal with her family when you fucking tore out of town.}
<P>__{(takes a breath)}
<D>__{we lost her. whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip, you and i have to live with that. but right now, there are some more people who need our help, and they shouldn't die too just because you've got a problem keeping the past in the past.}
<A>__{gabe knows he's right. but he's hesitant. and scared.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i don't want the responsibility.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{walk away and you are responsible. they'll die. i can't do this alone.}
<P>__{(gabe slows but doesn't stop)}
<D>__{you know what else, gabe? you can go anywhere you want, but if you don't do this, now, you're going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life.}
<A>__{gabe turns. sees maggie in the doorway. she's heard every word. gabe turns to hal hesitates and nods.}
