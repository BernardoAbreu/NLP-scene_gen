<T>__{dissolving with:}
<B>__{newspaper}
<A>__{spinning towards the camera and stopping full frame. its headline, over a picture of norville smiling, is "imbecile heads hudsucker." the subheadline: "not a brain in his head." another angle newspaper is angrily slammed down to reveal that norville has been reading the inside. his face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the intercom.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{miss smith, can you come in please to take a letter...}
<A>__{muttering to himself:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...of all the cockamamie...}
<A>__{amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil. as she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace behind it.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...did you happen to see the front page of today's manhattan argus?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{well, i... didn't bother to read the article. i didn't think the picture did you justice.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{the picture was fine! it's what that knuckle headed dame wrote underneath! of all the irresponsible... amy, take this down: dear miss archer. i call you 'miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! how on earth would you know whether i'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! no, change 'guts' to 'courage.' no, make it 'common decency.' these wild speculations about my intelligence }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{ or lack thereof?}
<C>__{norville}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{ these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine. if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! but i doubt it. i most seriously doubt it. as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales, a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years. yours sincerely, et cetera.}
<A>__{he drifts into thought.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{is that all, mr. barnes?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...well, you know me, amy, at least better than that that dame does. do you think i'm an imbecile?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm sure i }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{go on, tell the truth; i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{well, i }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh sure, you're biased you're a fellow muncian. but would an imbecile come up with this?}
<A>__{he whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle rendered onto it. amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to norville's proudly beaming face.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...i designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put hudsucker right back on top.}
<A>__{amy is bewildered. norville explains:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...you know! for kids!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...why don't i just type this up...}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{aww, naw, amy, that won't be necessary. i shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, i guess.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{well, i don't know; maybe she does deserve it. maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well, she probably had a deadline...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{sure, but she could still have gotten your side for the record!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well, it's done now what's the use of grousing about it. forget the letter, amy, i just had to blow off some steam...}
<A>__{she gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when norville adds:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...she's probably just a little confused.}
<A>__{amy turns at the door.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{confused?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{yeah, you know, probably one of these fast talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. probably is one of the boys, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{i'm quite sure i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{yeah, you know. suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? she's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh, is that it!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{yeah, you know. probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{smitty.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{exactly. and i bet she's ugly. real ugly. otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i bet that's exactly what she tells herself! but you and i both know she's just a dried up bitter old maid. say, how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work? i was thinking maybe the king and i }
<A>__{whap! amy slaps him. he stares.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...how about oklahoma?}
<A>__{as she stalks out of the office:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{norville barnes, you don't know a thing about that woman! you don't know who she really is! and only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about!}
<A>__{he stares, rubbing his cheek.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{say, what gives?}
<B>__{whistle shrieking.}
