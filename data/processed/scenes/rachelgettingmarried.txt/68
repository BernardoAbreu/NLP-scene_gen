<A>__{the ceremony guests, some standing, some in white chairs. the living room is festooned with wall to wall flowers. a canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace to the opened living room doors. sidney, looking stunning in a dove grey nehru suit and a lavender pocket square, waits at the altar with groomsmen kieran, norman sklear, and cousin joseph (now wearing full dress u.s. army uniform)... and officiating judge castle. sfx: live music "here comes the bride" on distant electric guitar and drums plus foreground violin and gently chanted "rachel's" and "sidney's" by the assembled friends. emma's smiling face fills the frame as the ceremony begins. bridesmaids emma, kayra williams, victoria, and the maid of honor! kym in her dress with her striped hair, split lip and black eye, trying to find her game face. the wedding guests are slack jawed. mrs. williams (sidney's mom) looks like she's passing a stone. abby stands quietly with andrew in the first row. she looks composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on her chin. the procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns to face rachel and paul. paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side of the house and across the terrace to the living room. she glows in her white and gold sari. they reach the altar of blossoms. rachel kisses her dad's cheek and he hugs her. things are set up so that rachel and sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the beautiful backyard. kym reaches for rachel's bouquet but rachel has handed it to emma by reflex. kym tries to cover her gesture. rachel and sidney join hands.}
