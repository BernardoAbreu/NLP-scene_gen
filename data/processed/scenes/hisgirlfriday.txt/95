<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{the greatest yarn ever written by anybody. my hat's off to you, hildy!}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{and what a way to quit. while you're still champion! that's the way to leave, hildy!}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{yeah. only only i'm not leaving, walter.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what do you mean? bruce'll be waiting for you in albany.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{no, he won't. i wired him that i wasn't coming.}
<B>__{closeup burns}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{where'd you wire him?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{on the nine o'clock train. that's the one he took, isn't it?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{sure.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{it's awfully clear now. bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace. i couldn't do that for him, walter. i'm what you made me a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... is that job still open?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{both jobs are open, hildy. the paper and being mrs. walter burns.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{thanks, walter, but it's no good. we tried it.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{sure, it was good it was wonderful! only you expected it to be like other marriages. it can't be like other marriages we're different! we're a different world. look at what we went through today. i wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. i bet you wouldn't, either.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{a fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{that's what makes it romantic. every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. but us you never know where i am and i'm not sure where you are. that's romance!}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{well, maybe i'd like to know just once!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{hildy, if that's what you want, all right. we'll even go to how about niagara falls?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(jumping)}
<D>__{niagara falls! walter, you don't mean that?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{sure i do. and i will tell you something else i'd like a baby.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{walter!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{sure, i can't last forever. i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{what would you do if it was a daughter?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{well, if she looked like you say! my brains and your looks that mightn't be such a bad combination.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{what's the matter with my brains?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? look, hildy, i'm proposing to you. what do you say?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{well, i'd like to be lady like and think it over.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i don't want to rush you. take a couple of seconds.}

<A>__{louie marches in with a judge, half dressed. louie has the judge in a tight grip.}
<B>__{med. close shot}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{hello, judge!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this is an outrage, mr. burns! sending a gunman to kidnap me!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{now, wait a minute, judge. this isn't a kidnapping. you've got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony, haven't you?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{now don't argue, hildy.}
<P>__{(to judge)}
<D>__{how about it, judge?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{yes, but }
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{then go ahead. come on, hildy.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{nobody's going to rush me into anything!}
<P>__{(as louie sticks a gun in her ribs)}
<D>__{you keep away from me!}
<P>__{(but she's scared)}
<C>__{louie}
<D>__{all right, judge.}
