<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hospital entrance corridor}
<A>__{a long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a night receiving desk, which is a glass window where they can buzz you in through a heavy door. a night nurse types at a desk nearby. she looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (t 1000) walking toward her.}
<D>__{t 1000 you have a sarah connor here?}
<A>__{she assumes he's with the other cops. smiles.}
<C>__{night nurse}
<D>__{running late, aren't you?}
<A>__{she turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees silberman and the cops coming toward the door from the other side.}
<C>__{night nurse}
<D>__{your friends are on their way out now...}
<A>__{when she turns back to the window, t 1000's no longer there. she goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking fountain or someplace. no. reception is empty. and so is the long corridor beyond. she frowns. too weird.}
