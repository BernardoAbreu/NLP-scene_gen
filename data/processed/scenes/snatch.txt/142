<L>__{1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin}
<A>__{kidney punches from good night, he's winded and only semi conscious (this is micky 2). micky 1 makes the effort to swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he can't get through. micky 2 takes more punishment in the ring, as micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces micky 1 down again. micky 1 looks up again and sees how much trouble micky 2 ' s in the ring. micky 1 is panicking now, he's running out of oxygen and micky 2's being beaten, micky 1 starts to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks up. and sees micky 2 being smashed to hell, his body eventually collapses and micky 2 falls through the floor. and as the latter falls through, micky 1 manages to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface. the punch continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "good night" on the jaw and it's good night for "good night" it's unlikely that he'll awake in the next hour. dear oh dear everybody is in trouble. again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.}
