<L>__{interior coupe night}
<A>__{lloyd driving. all three in the front seat.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{when you asked a minute ago it was five forty two. it is now five forty three. when you ask a minute from no, it will be }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i just don't want margo to miss her train. as it is, she'll barely make the theater...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{five fifty five. we'll be at the station in plenty of time...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that little place just two hours form new york. it's on my list of things i will never understand. like collecting shrunken indian heads...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{peace and quit is for libraries.}
<A>__{the car swerves suddenly and slightly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{lloyd, be careful...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{just a little skid, that's all. this road's like glass.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{karen and i just don't want an accident }
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i have no intention of having an accident!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's not important whether you do. we are wearing long underwear.}
<A>__{they all laugh. suddenly the car slows and stops with that hissing sound that can mean only one thing no gas.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{now what's this...?}
<A>__{he tries to start it again. no luck. he turns on the dashboard lights. the gas gauge reads empty.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{but it can't be! we can't be out of gas! i filled it myself yesterday!}
<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{wasn't it full when you drove to brewster this morning?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(very low)}
<D>__{i guess i didn't look. you know i don't pay attention to those things...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{incredible.}
<A>__{futilely, he runs the started again.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(crisply)}
<D>__{how much time have we?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{roughly ten minutes.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how far to the station?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{three or four miles...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(looking)}
<D>__{none in sight, there aren't many along this back road...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{not many car either, not much chance of a lift...}
<A>__{a moment of silence.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well. no sense my just sitting here. i'm going to walk up about half a mile, just in case.}
<A>__{he starts out of the car. the cold comes in like a knife, the women react.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you'll break your neck on that ice.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{what a way to die trying to get an actress to the theater in time. tell max i want to be buried with royalties...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't joke about such things.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{the audience will want its money refunded, believe me.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{thank you, lloyd. godspeed.}
<A>__{lloyd starts down the road. he slips once, recovers, waves and keeps going.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{be brave. he'll come back with or without gas.}
<A>__{they tuck the fur car robe around them. a pause. margo turns on the radio... it's "liebestraum."}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{do you want it on?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i detest cheap sentiment.}
<A>__{she turns it off. another pause.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{karen.}
<P>__{(karen says "hm?")}
<D>__{i haven't been pleasant this weekend.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{we've all seemed a little tense lately...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{come to think of it, i haven't been very pleasant for weeks. for that, i'm truly sorry. more than any two people i know, i don't want you and lloyd to be angry with me...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{we're never deeply angry, we just get sore. the way you do. we know you too well...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{so many people know me. i wish i did. i wish someone would tell be about me...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're margo. just margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{and what is that? besides something spelled out in light bulbs, i mean. besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way i do, you know. they carry on and misbehave they'd get drunk if they knew how when they can't have what they want. when they feel unwanted and insecure or unloved.}
<A>__{there's a pause.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what about bill?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what about bill?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he's in love with you.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{more than anything in this world, i love bill. and i want bill. i want him to want me. but me. not margo channing. and if i can't tell they apart how can he?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why should he and why should you?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{bill's in love with margo channing. he's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now margo channing will have ceased to exist. and what's left will be... what?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo. bill is all of eight years younger than you.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{those years stretch as the years go on. i've seen it happen too often.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not to you. not to bill.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{isn't that what they always say?}
<A>__{she turns the radio on again. a piano nocturne...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{silly, isn't it? you'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...}
<A>__{margo nods, get some cigarettes out of her bag. she offers one to karen. they light up.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{about eve. i've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. at best, let's say i've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young so feminine and helpless. to so many things i want to be for bill... funny business, a woman's career. the things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. you forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. that's one career all females have in common whether we like it or not being a woman. sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed and there he is. without that, you're not woman. you're something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings but you're not a woman...}
<P>__{(she smiles at karen)}
<D>__{... slow curtain. the end.}
<A>__{a pause. there are tears in karen's eyes.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo.}
<P>__{(she hesitates)}
<D>__{margo, i want you to know how sorry i am about this...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(indicating their predicament)}
<D>__{this. i can't tell you how sorry i am!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. after all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...}
<A>__{she snuggles down into her furs. karen flashes an unhappy look at her. she, too, snuggles down...}
