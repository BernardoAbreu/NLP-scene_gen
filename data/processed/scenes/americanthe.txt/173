<L>__{exterior town square day}
<A>__{jack runs into the square. larry pursues him, firing for a third time. the buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo around the square, bouncing off the walls and confusing the crowd. people start to run in different directions everyone heading for the maze of alleys that surround the main square. altar boys scatter. so do the local men carrying the statue of saint dominic. the statue tumbles and smashes. escaping snakes writhe. father benedetto takes cover. the two local carabinieri in their land rover get caught up in the chaos. confused, they turn on their sirens. larry spots jack in the crowd and fires a fourth time. one tourist is killed outright, another injured jack dives for cover behind the statue of the eagle where he spotted clara. bullets ricochet.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you're too old for this life, jack.}
<A>__{larry struggles for breath as he reloads. this is jack's chance.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you get sentimental then you fuck things up.}
<A>__{rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle, jack spreads his legs, faces larry and fires the customary two precision engineered shots that make up a military style execution: the first shot hits larry in the heart. larry is thrown backwards against a parked car, accidentally altering his arc of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside jack, chips of marble stinging against his calves. again, jack takes aim. a beat as his finger tightens on the trigger. headshot. half larry's face is wiped out of existence. what's left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees. his hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops. he falls forwards and his sterling clatters on the cobble stones. complete silence. not even the sound of a siren. the town square is empty. except for father benedetto hiding in the wreckage of the broken statue. jack's walther hangs ominously by his side. father benedetto stands unsteadily. like lightening jack spins, instinctively raising his walther and zeroing in on father benedetto. his face is devoid of all emotion. he is a bloody machine looking at a potential target. we hear sirens. across a slew of dead bodies, jack keeps the gun pointed at}
<B>__{father benedetto.}
<A>__{father benedetto stands stock still, facing jack. the sirens get louder.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what will you tell them?}
<A>__{a beat. father benedetto takes something from inside his soutane. and holds it up with a trembling hand. jack's letter.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i will them that the man who wrote this letter is my friend.}
<A>__{father benedetto smiles sadly.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{jack.}
<A>__{father benedetto shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer. the sirens get closer. we hear carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out of their cars, cocking submachine guns. when father benedetto opens his eyes again... ...jack has disappeared.}
