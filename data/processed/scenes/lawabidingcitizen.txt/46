<A>__{nick at the table with kell, riveted to cnn: state officials, including iger, are being grilled in a media frenzy. cantrell was right, it's a shitstorm of scrutiny...}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{emma, munching her bowl of breakfast cereal, slots the dvd in the player. she backs up, hits play with the remote. an image appears on screen, grainy. emma looks perplexed. it's not a normal dvd more like a bad home movie: a figure in a plastic coat and face shield turns from the camera to a table, where another man is strapped down. the first man raises a circular saw. the man on the table is thrashing weakly, trying to move. emma still has no idea what she's looking at. suddenly: the man with the saw makes a quick sweep across the table, across the other man's leg at the shin. the move was so fast and casual that it's taking a moment to sink in: emma stands frozen, clutching her cereal bowl.}

<D>__{daddy?}
<A>__{b.g., we see nick lean back in his chair, reacting to her tone of voice...and by what sounds like a shrieking saw. on screen, the man with the saw picks up the severed limb and shows it to the victim. it's been lopped off below the knee. emma drops her bowl it shatters at her feet. nick and kell enter behind her, confused, not sure what they're seeing... on screen, the man with the saw lops off the victim's forearm.}

<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{emma turns, throws herself into her parents' arms. they drop to their knees, shielding their sobbing daughter. push in on them staring at the shrieking saw...}
