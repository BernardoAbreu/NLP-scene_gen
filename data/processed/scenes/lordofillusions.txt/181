<D>__{be ready.}
<A>__{now we see that the cultists have bottles in their hands. with looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they smash the bottles to the ground at their bare feet. then they pick up more bottles, and smash them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of glass. on butterfield, smiling. he steps back into the sanctum.}
