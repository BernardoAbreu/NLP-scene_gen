<A>__{randy stands alone in front of yesterdaze, a strip mall vintage clothing store. he looks at his watch, almost thinking of leaving.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{randy looks up. he seems slightly thrown by what he sees.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{randy's pov: it's his first time seeing cassidy in street clothes and in daylight. she's not wearing makeup, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. she's also a good three inches shorter out of her stripper heels. they shake hands, a bit awkwardly.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{i almost didn't recognize you. you look all... clean.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{"clean"?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{like classy.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{gee, thanks.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{nah, nah, i don't mean that bad. i like it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's like in "grease", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. except backwards.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{oh kaay...}
<A>__{randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels he's used to.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{so, uh... should i call you cassidy or pam?}
<A>__{she gives the question genuine thought.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{pam.}
<P>__{(playful finger wag)}
<D>__{but don't get used to it.}
