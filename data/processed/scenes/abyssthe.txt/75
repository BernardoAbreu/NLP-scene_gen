<A>__{cab one maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while flatbed and cab three move above it. wilhite take readings with a hand held neutron counter.}

<D>__{cab one, radiation readings?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{neutron counter's not showing very much.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{wilhite, anything?}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{negative. nominal.}

<D>__{just continue forward along the hull.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{copy that, continuing forward. you just want me to get shots of everything, right?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. we're on a tight timeline.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{copy that.}
<A>__{the great black hull of the montana recedes into the darkness beyond the puny beams of their lights. it seems bigger than the titanic and just as eerie in its final resting place. on it side, the sub's top deck becomes a wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving. ahead, in the lights, is a white painted circle.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{that's the midship hatch. you see it, cab three?}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{roger, i see it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{just get around so your lights are on the hatch.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{check. then i just hang with these guys, right?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{how do you want me?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{just hold above it. alright, a team.}
<A>__{wilhite, schoenick, and monk unhook their short whip umbilicals from the central manifold and roll off the side of flatbed. they maneuver down toward the sub's hatch. hippy guides cab three in closer to the hatch area.}
