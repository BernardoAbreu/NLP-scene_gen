<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i got up. i ate breakfast and went shopping. during the after noon i read a novel.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what one.}

<D>__{there isn't any.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there's no risk?}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you say to him?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{he's asleep.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{always?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{please. now tell me. how do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{because he takes sleeping pills. he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but what about the noise from the car. what if }
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{the driveway's on my side of the house.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{we're talking.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now. you say the driveway's on your side of the house. so i guess you don't sleep in the same room.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{we don't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so you don't i mean i don't like to seem like i'm prying but i guess you don't sleep together or anything.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no we don't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well how long has this been going on.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<P>__{(looking at the ceiling for a moment)}
<D>__{about five years.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh no. are you kidding me?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you have not slept with your husband for five years?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{now and then. he geats drunk a few times a year.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how many times a year.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{on new year's eve. sometimes on his birthday.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{man, is this interesting.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so you don't love him. you wouldn't say you }
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{we've talked enough, benjamin.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{wait a minute. so you wouldn't say you loved him.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but you don't hate him.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no, benjamin. i don't hate him. unhook my blouse.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(unhooking her blouse)}
<D>__{well how do you feel about him, then?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. if you hated him at least you'd hate him.}
<A>__{she nods and takes off her blouse.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well you loved him once, i assume. when you first knew him.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i never did, benjamin. now let's }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, wait a minute. you married him.}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<P>__{(taking off her stockings)}
<D>__{see if you can guess.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well i can't.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{think real hard, benjamin.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{don't tell elaine.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh no. you had to marry him because you got pregnant?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{are you shocked?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well i never thought of you and mr. robinson as the kind of people who...}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{all right. now let's get to bed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{wait a minute. wait a minute. so how did it happen?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{not particularly.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{was he a law student at the time?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and you were a student also.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{at college.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what was your major?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{why are you asking me all this?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{because i'm interested, mrs. robinson. now what was your major subject at college?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{art.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{art?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but i thought you i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{kind of.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well how did it happen?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{how do you think.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i mean did he take you up to his room with him? did you go to a hotel?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{benjamin, what does it possibly matter?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm curious.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{we'd go to his car.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh no. in the car you did it?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i don't think we were the first.}
<A>__{ben thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what kind of car was it?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do you remember the make of the car?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{really. i want to know.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{it was a ford, benjamin.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{a ford! a ford! goddamnit, a ford! that's great!}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so old elaine robinson got started in a ford.}
<A>__{there is a pause.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{don't talk about elaine.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't talk about elaine?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{because i don't want you to.}
<A>__{she walks to the bed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well why don't you?}
<A>__{she pulls the bedspread down. ben begins to remove his jacket.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i wish you'd tell me.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{there's nothing to tell.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?}
<A>__{mrs. robinson uncovers one of the pillows.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well i guess i will have to ask her out on a date and find out what's }
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.}
<A>__{ben looks at her.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{do you understand that?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well look. i have no intention of taking her out.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i was just kidding around.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but why shouldn't i?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i have my reasons.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then let's hear them.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let's hear your reasons, mrs. robinson. because i think i know what they are.}
<A>__{she pulls the covers down.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm not good enough for her to associate with, am i? i'm not good enough to even talk about her, am i?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{let's drop it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we're not dropping it. now that's the reason, isn't it? i'm a dirty degenerate, aren't i? i'm not fit to }
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{benjamin?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm good enough for you but i'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. that's it, isn't it? isn't it?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you go to hell. you go straight to hell, mrs. robinson. do you think i'm proud of myself? do you think i'm proud of this?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, i'm not.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{you're not.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no sir. i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken down alcoholic!}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and if you think i come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{because mrs. robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. and you do what you want but i'm getting the hell out.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're goddamn right i am.}
<A>__{he starts putting on his shirt. she sits on the edge of the bed and watches him.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{that's how you feel about me.}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{that i'm a sick and disgusting person.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now don't start this.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't start acting hurt.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{don't you expect me to be a little hurt?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mrs. robinson, you stand there and tell me i'm not good enough for your daughter.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{did i say that?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{of course you did.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{benjamin, i want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well two minutes ago you told me i wasn't good enough for your daughter. now you say you're sorry i got that impression.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{i didn't mean it. i don't think you'd be right for each other. but i would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you wouldn't.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{of course i wouldn't.}
<A>__{mrs. robinson walks to the closet.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well look i was kind of upset there. i'm sorry i said those things.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{if that's how you feel }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but it's not.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<P>__{(smiling at him)}
<D>__{that's all right. i think i can understand why i'm disgusting to you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh no. look i like you. i wouldn't keep coming here if i didn't like you.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{but if it's sickening for you }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not! i enjoy it! i look forward to it. it's the one thing i have to look forward to.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{you don't have to say that.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well i wouldn't. i would never say it if it wasn't true.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{may i stay then?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes. please. i want you to.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well don't thank me, because i want you to.}
<A>__{there is a long pause.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{but you won't ever take out elaine, will you? i want you to promise me that.}
<A>__{there is another long pause.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look. why the hell did you bring this up. it never occured to me to take her out.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{then give me your word you won't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this is absurd.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{promise me, benjamin.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.}
<C>__{mrs. robinson}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{benjamin }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let's not talk about it. let's not talk at all.}
<A>__{at opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes.}
