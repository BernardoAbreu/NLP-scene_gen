<A>__{flashback football field seventy thousand people screaming. jimmy in the middle. younger jimmy. fresher jimmy. it's a night game at the coliseum. he's the quarterback. the snap. jimmy fakes the draw. rolls right. around him, all is impact. sound and fury. he targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket. sixty yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers. jimmy's face covered with dirt and mud. blood, too. young and proud. seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. he makes a difference.}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{he looks up at his reflection. glazed eyes, beard stubble. crows' feet around the eyes.}
