<A>__{heavy traffic on the freeway. a beat or two again the white car. it slows up opposite the distant motel. it makes a turn and goes back out of scene. a pause and it reappears on the old road and slowly makes its way toward the bates' motel.}

<A>__{we now see norman. he has brought out an old rocking chair and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched in it. and he is darning one of his own socks. camera holds. beyond the porch, and norman, we see the old house and can barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his mother seated at the window. here, too, there is that quality of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding. now norman looks up at the sound of the approaching car. and continues looking as the car comes to a stop and arbogast gets out. arbogast gives the place a quick once over, gazes at norman, starts forward. in his steps and manner there is that bored, routine logged quality of a man who has seen too many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers over too short a period of time. norman rises as arbogast comes forward.}
