<A>__{chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{chip!}
<A>__{chip makes an incoherent noise and jumps as jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. she's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{didn't you hear me calling your name?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{you weren't calling my name.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yes, i was.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i couldn't hear it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i think you were maybe spacing out. you were like this: derrrrr.}
<A>__{she mimics a blank, drooling expression.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i was?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yes, exactly like that. listen, i need to talk to you about you know who. our little needy.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{are you worried? `cause i'm super stressed about her. god knows how i even sleep at night.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{she hasn't been the same for weeks.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i think i know what's wrong with her. in fact, i know i know what's wrong with her.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{then tell me.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i feel bad telling you this.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{okay, you know needy's been a total lithium candidate since the night colin gray died. but that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff. it's because....i don't wanna say this.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{say it!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{needy and colin were intimate. by that i mean he was poking her donut on a semi regular basis.}
<A>__{chip looks astonished and hurt.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{i know this must be hard for you to hear.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{needy's not like that.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{that's what she wants you to believe. but trust me, her and colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. total varsity moves.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{but you were with colin the night he was killed.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, apparently he had a thing for me no surprise there. and i figured needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so i agreed to a little pity date. colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. but he wanted to go too far, so i left after a few minutes. next thing i knew, they'd found...}
<A>__{she sniffles, wiping her eye.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{...what was left of him.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{eye talian.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{never mind.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm sorry you had to hear this from me. i'm just so worried about needy. she's losing her shit. colin was her everything.}
<A>__{chip looks miserable.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{i wouldn't be surprised if she winds up in the nuthouse.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i just can't believe this.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, you've been talking to her more than i have. how bad is it?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{it's bad, man. it's bad.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{oh, you have no idea.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i just can't believe she would do this to you. i care so much about you, chip.}
<A>__{chip glances up at her. she's earnest, beautiful.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{more than i've ever had the guts to admit.}
