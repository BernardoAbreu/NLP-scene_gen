<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys stand before skipper and the others. skipper looks dark and angry.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you know what a loose cannon is? 'bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship. all it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm... it'd smash everything in its way, maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull. think about it, just one cannon not tied down, not anchored, could take a whole 'man of war' straight to the bottom.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{but we don't have any cannons?}
<A>__{chris jabs him in the ribs.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{skipper turns and faces them.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{now, if the skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat. even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea. better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew.}
<A>__{he takes a pause making sure he has their attention for this part.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{people are like that sometimes. they cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything. so you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing. i mean after all, you can always get new cannons.}
<A>__{he walks back to his place at the rail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want a tight ship, everybody shaved and in clean clothes when we make curacao. if it goes well, if your mid terms are acceptable, i may reconsider my decision about the rest of the trip. that's all.}
<A>__{dejected, the crew goes below.}
