<A>__{angle on our six team members' boots, in the distance. as we pan up and around we see a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids. like mercury. mesmerizlng. as we come around, the team stands looking at the sphere, 30 feet in dlameter, held by a giant claw gripping it from the top. they walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this answers one of our questions.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{which one? let me get the list out.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this spacecraft was designed to pick things up. they see things they want these claws go out and bring it in. they come across this. this... phere find it interesting, curious. they draw it inside to take back home.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{but on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{our present.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{but what does it do? this... sphere.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? see this red here.}
<A>__{angle on the sphere some dark red markings on it's surface...}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{looks like a design, some writing, maybe. maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look closely. that isn't writing. those are grooves.}
<A>__{on the red grooves engraved into the surface.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. they don't represent a message. they aren't decorative at all. they have another purpose entirely.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{a break for what?}
