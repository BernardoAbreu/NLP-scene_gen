<L>__{interior cargo hold ceti alpha v}
<A>__{terrell and chekov are held by four strong men. they seem to be waiting. one of the men is joachim. out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. a moment of suspense as terrell and chekov watch, terri fied. the mask is peeled back.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(aloud despite himself)}
<D>__{khan!}
<A>__{khan is startled by the recognition; comes over and examines chekov and terrell.}
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{i don't know you. but you. i never forget a face. mister chekov, isn't it?}
<P>__{(wonderingly)}
<D>__{i never thought to see your face again.}
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{chekov, who is this man?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{a criminal, captain a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering }
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{what do you want with us? i demand }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(mild)}
<D>__{you are in a position to demand nothing, sir. i, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. what you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of th botany bay , marooned here fifteen years ago by captain james t. kirk.}
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{listen to me you men and women }
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{save your strength, captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. do you mean he...}
<P>__{(i.e. chekov)}
<D>__{... never told you the tale? to amuse you, captain? never told you how th enterprise picked up th botany bay , lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?}
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{i've never even met admiral kirk }
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{admiral? he didn't tell you ho admira kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{you lie! on ceti alpha v there was life, a fair chance to }
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{this is ceti alpha v ! ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here. the shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste admira kirk never bothered to check on our progress. it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! on earth, two hundred years ago, i was a prince, with power over millions now, like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{captain kirk was your host! you repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.}
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(moves closer)}
<D>__{and i will wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous lieutenant mcgiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. out of love. and see ho admiral kirk requited her devotion she's dead as earth!}
<A>__{the wind howls in the silence. when khan turns, his eyes are filled with tears.}
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{a plague upon you all.}
<A>__{he recovers his poise and returns to them }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you didn't expect to find me. you thought this was ceti alpha vi. why are you here?}
<A>__{they don't answer. khan goes over to terrell and, with one hand, lifts him into the air }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{terrell gasps, stays silent }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no matter.}
<A>__{he lets go; terrell falls with a thud }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you will soon tell me willingly enough.}
<A>__{he goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in, pulling out two ceti eels wriggling items }
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me introduce you to ceti alpha v's only remaining indigenous life form; what do you think? they've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife. oh, not all at once and not instantly, to be sure. their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex. this has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion. later, as they grow, follows madness, paralysis and death. these are pets, of course not quite domesticated.}
<A>__{as he speaks, khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis }
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{khan, listen to me! captain kirk was only doing his duty! you }
<A>__{close up khan camera in}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{there is some pain at first, i am told, and then the effects are quite benign until the end. that was what i learned from watching my wife.}
<A>__{at a sign, the helmets are slammed down. as the muffled shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across the faces of chekov and terrell; with unerring in stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men. there is some atrocious pain as they enter then dazed calm.}
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's better! now: tell me why you are here and tell me where i may find james kirk.}
