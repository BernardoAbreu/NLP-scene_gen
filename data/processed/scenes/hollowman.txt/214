<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. he heads down the darkened tunnel. something scampers in front of him. small, not visible. sebastian sends it reeling with a swift violent kick.}
<L>__{interior corridor, by the elevator day}
<A>__{sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up the tunnel. he taps a code into the elevator vault doors. the vault doors open revealing the elevator. the doors slide open and sebastian steps inside.}
<C>__{elevator}
<D>__{authorization please?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{caine. one one one one one.}
<C>__{elevator}
<D>__{authorization valid. thank you.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian!}
<A>__{and there's linda. slicked with dirt and blood. she holds a oxygen container with a cut line.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i can't let you leave. come on out and i will give you one last chance.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you said it yourself, lin. i shouldn't hold on to the past.}
<A>__{the door starts to shut.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{aaaaaaahhhh!}
<A>__{she hits the top of a lighter duct taped to the hose. a line of pressurized fire blows into the elevator. wwhhhoooosshhhh! sebastian goes up in flame. linda runs toward the elevator. just as the door's about to close, she slides. her foot jamming into it. she lets loose with the flame again. sebastian, backed into the corner, has no where to go. he's yelling in pain. his latex face bubbles and burns. the surgical scrubs singe black. with no other escape route, he dives toward the door. linda looks up to see his flaming body fly over her, back into the corridor. linda kills the tank as sebastian continues to burn. the elevator lights flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of sparks. the elevator dies. linda pulls herself to her feet and turns to see... half of sebastian's head melted away, his latex facade a gruesome smoke damaged mass. his clothes are half burned revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like deformed blackened bubble wrap. sebastian crawls to his feet, but linda hits him with another shot of flame. sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the corner.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{linda stalks toward him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you wanna see god? i will show you god.}
<A>__{linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. sebastian, looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the corridor. he throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body. linda lets loose another jet of flame. it's smaller than the first and doesn't quite hit sebastian. linda checks the tanks pressure gauge. it slowly drops. linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. but as he pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re absorb themselves. sebastian is no longer visible. a quiet moment in the hallway as linda realizes how vulnerable she is. she looks around for him desperately. nothing. but something on the ceiling catches her attention. she blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. the sprinkler system, hit by fire, comes to life. water sprays down on the tunnel. sebastian is caught in the downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. it comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. he grabs linda and slams her against the wall. his watery hand smashes her across her face. linda reels. on the floor, she looks to see sebastian stalking toward her. she crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them . your sister... she never liked me. i think i will go after her and her little boy first.}
<A>__{sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. her head cuts open, blood dripping down.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i just wanted you to know that before you die.}
<A>__{linda collapses to the floor. sebastian's foot presses against her neck, squeezing it. linda gags for breath. but through the shoot of water that is sebastian, we see something also... a watery smudge. bam! matt smashes sebastian with the metal bar. sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down. matt staggers. it's taken all his strength to got there. he drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he sinks to his knees by linda.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{thought i'd... thought i'd save you for a change.}
<A>__{he gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{let's got out of here.}
<A>__{just as the two turn, sebastian rises with the crowbar. he swings it with a yell. matt pushes linda out of the way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. the conduit splits open and severs electrical wiring. the voltage shoots up the crowbar and into sebastian. as the current pulses through his body, sebastian vibrates. his blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his skeletal structure and major organs. sebastian is slowly electrified. smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible. finally he collapses. his body throbbing in and out of visibility. matt and linda stumble away.}
