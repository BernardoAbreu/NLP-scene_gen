<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i've seen that blog. how are you getting access to the internet?}
<A>__{lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside. the cell is covered in lit candles with sadie sat cross legged in the centre of the room.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{are you allowed to have all this stuff in your cell huh?}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{the dark master is near. it's too late to stop it now. tonight will behold a great becoming.}

<D>__{what's going to happen? you're planning on a human sacrifice aren't you?}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{all good things to those who wait.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{tell me!!}
<A>__{sadie stares directly at lisa with intense eyes. an unnaturally deep voice escapes her lips:}

<D>__{our time is at hand!}
<A>__{lisa slides the hatch shut. she walks over to the last door on the left. lisa slides the hatch open and peers in. the resident john doe sits in the shadows. suddenly he sits forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face. lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the internet article staring at her. the face of ronald "butch" defeo juniour. lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the hallway, her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate.}
