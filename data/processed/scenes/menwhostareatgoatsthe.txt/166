<A>__{lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by larry outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand at his feet a small insect of some kind. he begins to watch it with strange fascination. after a moment he sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it. one of the soldiers notices and starts to laugh softly. his neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to laugh himself. lyn looks around him, sensing the strange atmosphere creeping through the room.}
