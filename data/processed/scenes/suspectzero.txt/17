<D>__{did the right thing, agent mackelway. let's have a look.}
<A>__{charlton starts down the embankment. mackelway doesn't, hanging back as he eyes the tracks this buick made before tumbling. something about them... he pulls a small camera from his pocket, a minox. snaps off a few photos of the scene the buick, the ravine, those tracks, some footprints alongside them. then he heads down the 15 foot embankment.}
