<D>__{yeah, pride. the leader of the pride... when he gets on in years. it's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him. they go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him. it's humiliating. in front of all the females, this goes down. and after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush.}

<D>__{yeah, nature's got a real sick sense of humor.}
<C>__{buddy}

<A>__{a "now performing" poster on a metal stand: johnny cappella live at the paradise lounge! panning off the sign and following a couple through the doors into the theater. ...our eye drawn to the stage. a troupe of gorgeous female dancers in leopard print g strings, grinding their hips to the muscular rhythm. flanking them are a pair of strutting lions in elevated cages. an explosion of light and smoke... and johnny cappella makes his entrance. decked out in a reflective suit that picks up every light in the house and throws it back at the audience. johnny's got the style of a harry connick jr. and the moves of ricki martin. the energy this guy brings to the stage makes the last twenty years of buddy stafford's reign seem like suspended animation. the women in the audience start fanning themselves with delight. it's a new dawn in paradise. and the panties are coming fast and furious. we see shelly watching from the back of the room. he shifts his attention to nicky, larry and marty at a primo table. they're having a grand time. nicky pats larry on the back of the head. "good work, kid." larry turns and raises his drink to shelly. shelly stares right through him. a declaration of war.}

<A>__{natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches bernie's eye. his look suggests she's being played for a sucker. she decides against it. they walk off down the midway. bernie chuckles to himself.}

<D>__{you make some good points, shelly. maybe it'll swing back the other way, who knows? but the smart money suggests we roll the dice. i'm not gonna bullshit you; naturally there's gonna be a lot of restructuring in the months to come, but i want you to know, you'll always have a place with us.}

<B>__{on bernie and natalie}
<A>__{down on their knees. bernie places his arm around natalie, pulls her close to him. paralyzed with terror, she still manages a bittersweet smile. bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but his overwhelming love for natalie in his eyes. it's a two way current. this is their last moment together; everything that needs to be said is being transmitted through a look. a look that says: no regrets.}
