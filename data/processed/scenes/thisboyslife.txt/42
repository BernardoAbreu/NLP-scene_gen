<L>__{exterior shooting range day}
<A>__{the shooting match has begun. the contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's eye fifty yards away. the scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard. a contestant finishes shooting. there is a pause. everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's eye hangs. the score comes: there is a smattering of applause, and it's dwight's turn. from his stance, dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot. he's nervous, though, because caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his ten shots in rapid succession, hardly pausing to breathe. a pause, and then his score is raised: 73. dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the winchester to caroline. there are a couple of whistles as caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "oh, mama, shake that thang!" caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional looking. she shoots her ten bullets, taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot. the pause, and her score is raised: 93. there is a moment of surprised silence, and then the crowd gives caroline a sincere round of applause. same scene later dwight looks stunned, and toby is almost equally surprised. on the scoreboard, we see that caroline is in second place and by only two shots. as the next to last round finishes, caroline is surrounded by a few people who are complimenting her shooting. dwight's smile is even bigger: oh, he wanted to be the one to win. the last round starts. a man, evidently the one in first place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. as he passes caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks confidently.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that second place trophy ain't bad, honey.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{then you won't feel too bad about carrying it home, will you?}
<A>__{several people laugh, and the man, bested, turns away. everyone turns quiet to watch the man shoot. he is evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he shoots and waits, the score is raised: 95. there is an immediate stir caroline can win if she shoots a virtually perfect round. dwight's name is called. he takes his position, but clowns around, shooting first left handed, then right handed, then with both eyes closed. his score is raised: 24. there is scattered laughter, and dwight leads it hell, it's all a joke to him, his attitude says. caroline takes her stance. rock steady, she shoots her ten shots and waits. and then it comes: 98. she's won. the second place man wheels away angrily, but everyone else congratulates the laughing caroline, as an official presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a pedestal, and a huge ham. in the midst of the hubbub, toby manages to get close enough to congratulate his mother. caroline glances toward dwight as she whispers to toby:}
