<D>__{yeah? you wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i've got pasta at home.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i'm pretty hungry, but }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ooh!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i've got a great idea!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{let's get breakfast.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{now?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{pancakes?}
<A>__{summer's resistance is futile. and the rest as they say is history. fade up: "number two" by the pernice brothers. which plays}
<T>__{over:}
<A>__{(417 464)}
<L>__{1. int tom's bathroom day}
<A>__{tom shaves. makes himself look presentable. later. tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other.}
<L>__{2. ext city sidewalk day}
<A>__{tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline.}
<L>__{2. int library day}
<A>__{tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many taschen books on innovative building design.}
<L>__{3. int office lobby day}
<A>__{tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high rise.}
<L>__{4. ext soccer field day}
<A>__{tom and his mom and step dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. it's a nice temporary distraction for him.}
<L>__{6. int tom's bedroom day}
<A>__{tom getting bad news on the phone. he has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). he crosses "abrams and abrams" off the list. we notice several others are also crossed off.}
<L>__{5. ext golden gate bridge day}
<A>__{tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge.}
<L>__{8. ext park day}
<A>__{tom jogs. a little faster this time.}
<L>__{9. int tom's bedroom night}
<A>__{tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. few remain. he sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. for a beat, lost in thought. then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the tv and joylessly watches the nothingness.}
<L>__{9. splitscreen day}
<A>__{on the left, tom, alone, on a bus. looking out the window. thinking. on the right, summer. in her wedding dress. the veil is lifted. and she's a bride.}
<B>__{end music.}
<A>__{(478)}
<L>__{ext office building another day}
<A>__{tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. we can see he is frustrated but not deterred. in the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took summer ages ago.}
<L>__{ext. park day}
<A>__{tom walks over and sits down on a bench. he stares off, lost in thought. and then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.}
<C>__{summer }
<E>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. she may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. tom isn't sure if she's real. he doesn't quite know what to do.}
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(re: suit)}
<D>__{where you coming from?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what? oh. nowhere. how long have you been sitting there?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{awhile.}
<A>__{tom finds it hard to look at her.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i come here a lot. i always loved this place, ever since you brought me here.}
<A>__{the mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so... i should probably say congratulations.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{probably. but only if you mean it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't know if i do honestly.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah well...anyway...i hope you're happy.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{you really do?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{god no.}
<A>__{they both laugh a little. the tension begins to dissipate.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{how are you, tom?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm good. ish.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah i quit the office.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{really? that's great! what are you doing now?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{mostly...sleeping. breaking things.}
<A>__{awkward silence.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so who's the guy?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{who, my guy?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah... wait. don't tell me. i don't want to know.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no really, i don't.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{more awkward silence. this one goes on a beat longer. and}
<T>__{then:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's amazing to me. you're married.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{pretty crazy, huh?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i will never understand that.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's different now? how could things change so quickly?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i don't know. it just happened.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what happened?! that's what i don't get.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i... tom...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what, tell me...}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i woke up one day and i knew.}
<A>__{tom says nothing.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i knew i could promise him i'd feel the same way every morning. in a way that i... i never could with you.}
<A>__{and there's not much else to say after that. tom gets up to leave.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know what sucks? realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{destiny, soulmates, true love. all that stuff. it's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? god!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom, don't go.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i should have listened to you, summer. you were right all along.}
<A>__{summer takes a beat to let this hang there.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i was right?}
<A>__{and then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what? this is funny?}
<A>__{tries to stop but it only makes it worse. now's she's completely cracking up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what are you laughing at?}
<A>__{and she can't stop. she's totally lost control.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(trying himself not to laugh)}
<D>__{you're a crazy person!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom! you're the crazy person!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what are you talking about?!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{one day i'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. now he's my husband!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is funny to you?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what would have happened if i went to the movies instead? if i went somewhere else for lunch? if i showed up to eat ten minutes later? tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. and as it was happening, i knew it. i could feel it, sure as the sun. and i kept thinking to myself "holy shit. tom was right." you were right about all of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it just wasn't me you were right about.}
<A>__{tom is speechless. summer takes his hand. we may notice her wedding ring. we may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. we hold it for a few seconds more. and then, the hands separate.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{anyway, i should probably be getting back. it was good to see you. i'm glad you're well.}
<A>__{summer gets up and starts walking away from him. after a}
<T>__{second:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{summer!}
<A>__{she stops and turns back. he takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i really do hope you're happy.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see you later.}
<A>__{and she walks away. the camera tracks away with her, leaving tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<A>__{a few seconds of black, before...}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{(500)}
<L>__{int office waiting area day}
<A>__{tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of allen, prince, and gethers architecture. from the room we can tell this firm is big time. tom waits. we notice, before he does, a very cute girl sitting in a another chair, also waiting. she smiles. he smiles back.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{are you here to interview?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{are you interviewing? for the position?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh. yeah. why, are you?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ah. my competition.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it would appear.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{gee, this is a little awkward.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, i hope you don't get it.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i hope you don't get it.}
<A>__{they both laugh. there's a silence for a few beats. and it's during this time that something weird comes over tom and we can visibly see it in his face. he likes the look of this girl. this girl is cute. he'd like to talk more with her. and, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so, uh...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{are you from...california?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{grew up not too far from here. atherton, near stanford.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i know atherton. nice area.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{have i seen you before?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i, uh, don't know. i don't think so.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{do you go to st. patrick's? not to pray or anything but to stand outside?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i do! i love that church. it's like my favorite structure in the city.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{if only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes! exactly. i totally agree!}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think i've seen you there.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you have? really? hmm. i didn't see you.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it happens. you probably weren't looking.}
<A>__{a man comes out.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{tom hansen?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on back.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he starts to go. but halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{if tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. coincidence. that's all anything ever is. nothing more than coincidence.}
<A>__{animation. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. real fast. hardly noticeable. but it's there.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{it took a long time but tom had finally learned. there are no miracles. there's no such thing as fate. nothing is meant to be. he knew. he was sure of it now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tom was...}
<A>__{tom turns back around.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{...pretty sure.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(to girl)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hello stranger.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{oh. i'm sorta supposed to meet someone.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(deflated)}
<D>__{oh. got it... no problem.}
<A>__{he turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on the task at hand. a job interview. and then he hears.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{tom turns back around.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{great! so... i will wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something.}
<A>__{she laughs. she's cute when she laughs.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{we'll figure it out.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ok!}
<P>__{(extends hand to shake)}
<D>__{my name's tom.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{nice to meet you...}
