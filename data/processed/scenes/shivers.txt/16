<L>__{interior tudor's office afternoon}
<A>__{tudor's secretary, a lumpy and motherly lady named mrs. wheatley she has a nameplate on her desk is shuffling some papers when the telephone rings. her small cubicle of an office is appended to tudor's only slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building. the door leading to tudor's office is closed.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{ashen & gaunt, insurance appraisals. mr. tudor? one moment, please. i will buzz him.}
<A>__{she places the caller on 'hold' and presses the inter office buzzer. she directs her attention for a moment to the papers on her desk. when, after a pause, she notices that tudor hasn't answered the phone, she releases the caller from 'hold' and picks up the receiver.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{i'm sorry to keep you waiting. i will put you on 'hold' again and see if i can find mr. tudor.}
<A>__{mrs. wheatley pushes the 'hold' button and gets out of her chair. she knocks gently on the door.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{nicholas? there's a call for you.}
<A>__{perplexed by tudor's failure to respond, mrs. wheatley gingerly opens the door.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{nicholas? it's that man whose lamborghini caught fire on st. catherine street and burned to the ground. he's very angry...}
<A>__{she catches a glimpse of tudor rolling around on the floor behind his desk, his swivel chair tipped over on to its side.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{nicholas! what happened?}
<A>__{she rushes over to tudor and helps him to his feet. tudor is breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on the desk while mrs. wheatley straightens up the chair for him. tudor collapses into the chair, mumbling and rolling his head from side to side. mrs. wheatley pulls a kleenex from her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming from one corner of tudor's mouth.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{we're going to get you to a hospital. that's what we're going to do.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(beginning to come around)}
<D>__{no, no. i will be all right. i'm all right.}
<A>__{mrs. wheatley shows tudor the spot of blood on her kleenex.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{do you see this? this is blood. it came from your insides. that means it's serious. probably an ulcer. you executives are all the same.}
<A>__{tudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk, still pretty wobbly.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<P>__{(smoothing the hair}
<D>__{back from tudor's forehead in a very}
<P>__{motherly fashion)}
<D>__{now, nicholas, it doesn't cost anything to be sure everything's all right. i think you should definitely go to the emergency ward and...}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(abruptly, swiveling}
<D>__{away from mrs.}
<P>__{wheatley's hand)}
<D>__{call me a cab, will you please, mona? i'm going home for the day.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<D>__{nicholas, i think...}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{i don't care what you think. please call me a cab. now.}
<A>__{mrs. wheatley steps away from the desk, obviously hurt by tudor's brusqueness.}
<C>__{mrs. wheatley}
<P>__{(mollifyingly)}
<D>__{all right, nicholas. all right.}
<A>__{she leaves, closing the door behind her. tudor sighs, taking a deep breath. he is suddenly hit by another twinge of pain. he clutches his stomach. blood trickles out of the corner of his mouth. after a pause, he licks the blood off his lips with the tip of his tongue.}
