<L>__{exterior central control server}
<A>__{mega and x takks escort rush across bridges, in security portals. firewalls cool and part, allowing them to pass. down a grand corridor, past towering energy columns and throbbing green memory banks. they cross a bridge. view includes: vast square concentric security rings surround a massive cubic power supply core.}
<L>__{interior plexor cpu}
<A>__{plexor toils over the latest security breech, failing to decipher recordings of the intruder. rush is brought in buy mega. he double takes on plexor, the cyber twin of sinclair.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{plexor. this is the one.}
<A>__{plexor steps closer, scanning rush.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{you are not rx23.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{my name is rush. i'm a look, i got an id on the intruder. do you know the program they used to call tron?}
<A>__{plexor activates memory banks. accesses archive files of the original low rez tron: so harmless, so many years ago. bears little resemblance to the upgraded tron.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{you are in error. zero match.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{exactly. that's how he's getting past you. you don't see him for what he is. he's one of your own, gone bad. tron was a crude security program from encom's old days. strictly low rez, right? archived and forgotten. but his source code contains all the architecture of every encom system, including x net.}
<C>__{rush }
<D>__{that's why some smart user dusted him off and upgraded him }
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{"user"?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{people. like me. from the outside. people who write all of your instructions.}
<A>__{plexor and mega trade a look.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{he displays random instability.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{users do not exist.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{how do we contact sinclair? he'll explain.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{define "sinclair".}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you don't know? oh geez. there must be a way to link him into this.}
<A>__{rush touches plexor's command console, but his energy overloads the system x takks pull rush away.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{zero match for a "sinclair".}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{he's your boss. everybody's boss. outside, in the real world.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{assuming the existence of a world beyond this, is a fatal error.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{plexor issues all commands. x takks grep grep.}
<A>__{rush considers his predicament.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{okay. sorry. i'm a program, guess i got a piece of my code corrupted. whatever it is, it's given me power over tron.}
<P>__{(to x takks and mega)}
<D>__{they saw me read his circuits. can any other program do that?}
<A>__{plexor looks to mega.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{he creates alternative data channels at will.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{chaos.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{yeah, i'm a little unstable. but i can find tron for you.}
<A>__{plexor processes. his eyes stream barcode data to x takks:}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{release him.}
<A>__{x takk troops read plexor's barcode command with their eyes. they let go of rush. plexor turns to mega. issues more barcode.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{interface with this one. exploit his ability. locate the program "tron" and destroy him on sight.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{instructions received, plexor.}
<A>__{mega exits with rush. plexor's gaze lingers on rush.}
