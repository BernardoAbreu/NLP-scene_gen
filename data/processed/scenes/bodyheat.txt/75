<A>__{racine comes into the reception room from the hall. he's surprised the door is unlocked. he crosses the room and opens the door to his office. matty is sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk. she jumps up at the sight of him and moves up to embrace him.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{jesus! did beverly see you?}
<A>__{matty kisses him on the mouth, then shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i waited till i saw her leave. please don't be angry with me.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{angry? i'm not angry how'd you get in?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{it didn't lock. oh. ned, hold me. please just hold me, god, i love you.}
<A>__{racine reaches over and locks the door to his office.}

<D>__{he left this morning. i had to see you.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i couldn't call. i'm afraid to call. i was afraid you wouldn't let me come.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yes, that's right. you can't call. never call. we have to be very careful now about the phone. the phone company keeps records.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i'm careful. i hated it, ned. i hated sitting there with the two of you. i thought i was going to scream. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(distracted, thinking)}
<D>__{you did good.}
<P>__{(finds his thought)}
<D>__{you've called my apartment from the house.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{no, never.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{no? those two times }
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i went to phone booths. i'm afraid of him, ned. i'm always afraid.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's good. we have to be careful about the phones now.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{why, ned, why do you say this now?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(in his own thoughts)}
<D>__{we could account for a couple calls. we've had some contact. that would make sense.}
<A>__{matty grasps his face in her hands and looks into his face.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{why, ned? what's happened?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{because we're going to kill him. we both know that.}
<A>__{matty's face looks different than we've seen it. there's a fire burning behind there and the heat it's throwing is bringing her equal portions of dread and relief. she stares at him,}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's what you want, isn't it? we knew it was coming. it's the only way we can get everything we want, isn't it?}
<A>__{matty's nod is barely perceptible.}

<D>__{the man's gonna die for no reason but we want him dead. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine }
<D>__{he doesn't deserve it. let's not ever say that. we're doing it for us. and you're going to inherit half of everything he owns. that's what the will says, right?}
<A>__{again, the tiny nod. he pulls her head close, so he doesn't have to look into her eyes anymore.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's it then. we're gonna kill him. and i think i know how.}
<A>__{matty reacts to this.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{it's real, then?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah, it's real all right, and if we're not careful, it's gonna be the last real thing we do.}
