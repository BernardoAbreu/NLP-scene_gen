<L>__{interior the car still driving same time}
<A>__{vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette. he tosses his pack to sam, but he seems a little surprised at sam's request.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{help yourself.}
<P>__{(quick beat)}
<D>__{since when do you smoke?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(lighting up)}
<D>__{i have, i don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{a cigarette? as in one?}
<P>__{(exasperated, almost to himself)}
<D>__{one cigarette a week, who smokes like that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{christ, i smoke a pack and a half a day, and i tell myself i could be worse.}
<P>__{(takes a satisfying drag)}
<D>__{it's just so damned pleasurable.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(blowing a smoke ring with great skill)}
<D>__{it has it's moments.}
<P>__{(stubs out cigarette)}
<D>__{course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(with a sigh)}
<D>__{there is that.}
<A>__{vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy that sam has spoiled his smoke.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so, vincent: why bring me along for the ride? job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. a tough guy.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{like larry or swede.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{exactly. why not bring them?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{let's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited. of course, i might have brought gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate for this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{watch that one, he's an ex spook for sure, maybe stasi, maybe kgb. he's smart, gregor is.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so is the woman.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{deirdre? smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i wonder if she truly left the ira.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've wondered that myself. none of this answers my question, though...}
<P>__{(suddenly direct)}
<D>__{why bring me?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i wanted to see who you were.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who am i?}
<A>__{vincent, driving all the while, gives sam a sideways glance before speaking.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you were once some kind of special forces. airborne ranger, maybe a navy seal. after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan, a real mercenary.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{only now now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. there's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money i couldn't afford not to take it. somebody's paying through the nose for this.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{they certainly are. whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.}
<A>__{and on that thought we }
