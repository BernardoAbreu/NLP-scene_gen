<A>__{trillian can't hold on. flips off the back. skips across the water. finnegan roars away. a tentacle hard on his ass. trillian pops to the surface. treads water. panicked. watches finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. finnegan looks back at trillian. bobbing in the water. the he looks at the saipan. continuing its arc. its deadly payload racing for the fuji maru. finnegan cranks the handlebars. smashes through a wave and heads for trillian. trillian sees him and swims hard. the saipan roars straight at the fuji maru. the warhead perfectly positioned to strike its hull. only fifty meters away. now forty. now thirty five.}
