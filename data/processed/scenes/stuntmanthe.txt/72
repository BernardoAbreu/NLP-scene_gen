<L>__{interior municipal building asylum set}
<A>__{in a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in a world war i military asylum. in it, eli's crew is filming a sequence a dozen enraged inmates in tatters, heads shaven, wild eyed, advance toward raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of cameron's exultant yell).}
<L>__{67 closer angle}
<A>__{raymond, dressed as a british flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated derelicts suddenly swarm over him. one, like a mad dog, goes fro his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club. raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.}

<D>__{...stop!...get away!!}
