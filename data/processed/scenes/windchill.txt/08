<L>__{exterior university student parking lot day}
<A>__{our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely empty parking lot. it's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. a few snowflakes swirl in their sickbed glow. we follow her to... a beat to shit 1988 oldsmobile idling in the middle of the lot. an unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the only vehicle here for some time. an underclassman guy, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the oldsmobile. he's skinny, dressed in thrift shop clothes, has the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun much. his car is filled with all of his earthly possessions: books, cd's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc. she knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake. he stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance?}
<A>__{the sight of her quickly snaps him awake. he scrambles out.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(still a little groggy)}
<D>__{there were still cars when i got here. i thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{quarter past three.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm two hours late?! shit. sorry. you should've just left without me. that's what i would've done. hurry up and pop the trunk so i can stow my shit.}
<A>__{he does. she walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity with more of his things: clothes, a bag of groceries, etc.}
<C>__{girl }
<P>__{(calling to him)}
<D>__{jesus, i'm just going home for christmas. what are you doing? pulling up stakes and movin' your oakie family to californey?}
<A>__{she starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm kinda getting kicked out of my apartment. i didn't have time to find someplace new before exams.}
<A>__{she takes out some of his things. puts them on the ground.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{here, let me help you with that }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why don't you just get the engine started and put the heat on? i can handle this.}
<A>__{he watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed.}
<C>__{girl }
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{well? what are you waiting for? i thought you wanted to stay ahead of the snow?}
<A>__{he hurries back to the driver's seat. starts the engine. she hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk. then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door handle. stuck.}
<D>__{now it's her turn to look impatient. she jerks on the handle again, until he leans over to open the door from the inside.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sorry... it sticks. she rolls her eyes, climbs in.}
