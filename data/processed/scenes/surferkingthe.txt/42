<A>__{robbie has set down the radio, and is walking back to katie now, who is swaying to the music. he doesn't get too close to her, and actually stands off to her left. since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style. robbie has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively, almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner. they proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed. finally it occurs to them both.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(quizzically)}
<D>__{so where did you learn to dance like this?}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{eight years at miss vickie's studio of dance. what surprises me is you.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(somewhat embarrassed, keeps dancing)}
<D>__{can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{when you grow up within spitting distance of hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next harrison ford. so when i was about 12, my mom started taking me to all these auditions for things.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so are you the next harrison ford?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{some days i'm not even the next robbie zirpollo.}
<A>__{they continue to dance. after a few moments...}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{....and?}
<A>__{they stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{turns out i get this part. they're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything. they lock this girl and i into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{doesn't sound so terrible. you certainly learned how to dance.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it. i couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off.}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(touched, drawing closer)}
<D>__{i'm not laughing.}
<A>__{they kiss, then return to dancing.}
