<L>__{exterior mansion, victoria peak day}
<A>__{a vintage aston martin pulls up to a spectacular gated mansion. sparkling white, it is a blend of edwardian and regency. gin is driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open. as they pull up the crushed rock driveway... ...a butler appears, as british as the architecture. climbing from the car, mac has the halliburton case.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{will you please come this way?}
<A>__{and leads them around the side of the house. they walk slowly, a distance behind the butler, taking everything in.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i like this.}
<A>__{his voice is strong, calm. no hint of a smile.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you like wha...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{not being told what the fuck we're doing.}
<A>__{she looks equally serious. just more tense.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're on a 'need to know' basis. you'll get each step in time to execute, i thought you agreed to those condit...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{i like your not trusting me. because it frees me to do the same.}
<A>__{they come upon the spacious grounds behind the mansion. a breathtaking view down the slope of victoria peak to hong kong and the harbor. kowloon across the water.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i trust you. i only need to...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...remain in control.}
<A>__{they pass a towering row of perfect rosebushes. mac snaps off a giant blossom.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{which is a sign of weakness.}
<A>__{and hands it to her. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i like that, too.}
<A>__{at the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon table has been set. spread with delcacies. two servants attend, also british. only the host is seated. he does not rise.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{colonel}
<A>__{col. qiu glances up from his meal. green pla uniform, absurdly decorated, wraparound gautier sunglasses. we recognize him as the man who took gin's call in his mercedes in tienanmen square. the man who accompanied the poor minister of finance to the ophthal mologist.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{you look lovely, ginger. is the rose for me?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{and leans prettily. to fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{col. qiu lai chuen, this is andrew macdougal.}
<A>__{hearing his real name, mac cuts her a look.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{real names here, darling. the colonel and i have every incentive to keep each other's secrets.}
<A>__{and she sits. close to qiu. mac looks around at the property, the view.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{like the place, andy?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{please. mr. macdougal will do.}
<A>__{the colonel smiles. first time. like an alligator. mac notices that the tablecloth is actually... ...a union jack. he fingers the flag.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{this way. doesn't matter if we spill.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{my sentiments exactly.}
<A>__{he sits.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{this place was a gift. from its former owner. a brit whose business will now happily continue to function. perhaps...even expand.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{planning to spend much time here?}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{tho it has required many sacrifices.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the colonel has divorced his wife. to facilitate the necessary entertaining of western women.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{tho some are more entertaining than others.}
<A>__{and runs the back of his knuckles up the length of gin's bare arm.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{colonel. you are touching the woman i love...}
<A>__{which brings qiu's eyes over. really?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{from time to time.}
<A>__{and pulls up the halliburton case. handing it across the table. as qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{you're a scot. would you like some 25 year old macallan?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{sure, i will take a case.}
<A>__{qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the bar trolley. as the drinks are prepared, the colonel studies the bone.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the colonel told his minister of culture that he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from taiwan.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ah. how much was the minister told the raid would cost?}
<C>__{qiu }
<D>__{counting equipment, personnel, bribes, an even fifty million american. all in.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{which you can now keep.}
<A>__{the drinks arrive.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{he would have paid twice that. but my needs are modest.}
<A>__{and lifts from beneath the table, a leather pouch.}
<C>__{qiu}
<D>__{unlike. the woman you love. from time to time.}
<A>__{drops it into gin's lap. she opens the pouch to reveal... ...goggles. like one would wear in a tanning salon. only these are flesh colored with one small hole in the center of each lens. slightly larger than the size of a pupil. she slips them on. a bright smile.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{how do i look, honey?}
<A>__{and mac smiles. in return.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{like a woman. of mystery.}
