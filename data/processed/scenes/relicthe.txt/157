<L>__{interior margo's labs day}
<A>__{greg kawakita wears gloves, high powered glasses, works in solitude in the lab. suddenly he stands up, throws off the glasses, then he sits down again. he seems to be struggling with himself. he glances over his shoulder to make sure he's alone. quickly he moves to a locked drawer. he opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small envelope, looks inside. insert... the envelope is full of the plant fibers! greg has managed to keep his own cache! moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide with a shaking hand. with an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver, pops it into his mouth. he closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the taste. then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the slide. he takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer. he turns the key carefully and we go close on his hand... on the back is a row of scales...}
