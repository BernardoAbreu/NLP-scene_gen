<L>__{exterior desert road minutes later}
<A>__{the cherokee speeds down the empty highway.}
<L>__{interior cherokee same time}
<A>__{jeff drives, a determined expression.}
<L>__{exterior desert highway day}
<A>__{the jeep blows past.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior belle's diner day}
<A>__{a weather beaten structure with a gravel parking lot. a peeling sign on the roof: "belle's: beer & food." there is a phone booth outside. the cherokee pulls in and parks. jeff chirps the alarm, heads for the entrance.}
<L>__{interior belle's day}
<A>__{dark and dingy. formica tables, a bar. chunky customers in k mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and watching a football game on a big muted tv. jeff enters and all conversation stops. the other patrons turn and stare. after a moment, they return to their beers. jeff glances around. no sign of amy. no sign of red. a bored looking bartender stands behind the counter, preparing a sandwich. behind him, a blackboard menu. jeff approaches.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{the bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i was supposed to meet my wife here.}
<A>__{the bartender shrugs, gives him a look: yeah, so?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{dark hair, slender, about five five. wearing a pale blue benetton shirt.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{a pale blue what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{benetton shirt.}
<A>__{the bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an order slip.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hank! your order's ready.}
<P>__{(to jeff)}
<D>__{i been busy. they come and go.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it would've been within the last half hour. she might've been with a trucker?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{a trucker.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{guy with a baseball cap. driving an eighteen wheeler.}
<A>__{the bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{don't ring a bell.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{the bartender leans over the counter, calls out:}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hey! man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. anybody see 'em?}
<A>__{jeff looks up and down the counter. blank faces, a few disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no. a disheveled female barfly, flo, grins up at him.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{looks like she got away from ya, cowboy.}
<A>__{a few of the regulars chuckle at this. jeff ignores them, turns back to the bartender.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{could she have left a message with another one of your employees?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{don't see how. i'm the only one who works here.}
<A>__{jeff scratches his head. this doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't understand. is there another belle's diner?}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{no siree. definitely not.}
<A>__{jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around. an elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him. they whisper to each other.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he turns and goes outside...}
