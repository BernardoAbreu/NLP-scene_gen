<L>__{exterior the killing ground, cold mountain. morning}
<A>__{ada and ruby arrive at the scene of murder. pangle is keeled over at the old poplar, snow covering him. only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him. ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{maybe teague's took him. they did that with the swanger boys didn't, they? dragged them into town, then strung them up as warning... it's snowed since, so i can't read the story on the ground.}
<A>__{ada fishes out pangle's banjo from the snow. it's broken and the strings hang slack.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{let's dig.}
<A>__{later and ruby finishes off the grave, hammering in a stone to mark the place. ada walks away towards the creek, to wash her hands. she bends and rinses her face. as she looks up she sees stobrod on the other side of the creek; half in, half out of the water, slumped against a tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which covers him.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{ruby! ruby!}
<A>__{ruby arrives at ada, looks to where she's looking, walks straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the freezing water. she puts a head to his chest, seeks out a pulse at his wrist. calls back to ada.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{he's still breathing!}
<P>__{(to stobrod)}
<D>__{god damn! daddy; daddy it's ruby. don't you die on me again.}
<P>__{(to ada)}
<D>__{he's still breathing!}
