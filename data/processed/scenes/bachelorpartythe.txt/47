<L>__{exterior. street night}
<A>__{the four men straggle along tenth street east of seventh avenue. this is a dark little street. off at the intersection, you can see seventh avenue and an occasional car moving downtown, but west tenth street right now seems an empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment houses. the houses sometimes have little stoops. on one of the stoops, there is a woman sitting. she is in her thirties, not attractive nor unattractive. she wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too. as the four men approach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half questioningly. the four men note her in passing and seem to continue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten paces down.}
<B>__{close group shot of the four men.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i think we've got one for you, arnold.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{one what?}
<A>__{eddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. they all turn to look. actually, charlie has ambled a few paces even further down and doesn't know quite why they've stopped. they look at the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily. rest of the scene from her point of view.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{ah, come on, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{she ain't bad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(calling from a few paces down)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we've got a live one.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(starting to walk)}
<D>__{come on, let's go.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{arnold, for pete's sake.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ah, leave him alone! he doesn't want to.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{come on. we've been walking around all night here are you a man, or ain't you?}
<A>__{arnold frowns.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{all right, all right.}
<A>__{with a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man. the four men, charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward the woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling her bare foot back into the unused shoe.}
<C>__{the woman}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{i don't know who you fellows think i am, but you fellows have the wrong idea about me.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah, i know. arnold, see that bar down the corner. that's where we'll be.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{i'm afraid you fellows have the wrong idea about me.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{she says we have the wrong idea.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ah, leave him alone.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{you fellows are working under a misconception.}
<A>__{eddie and walter have already started down the street to the bar.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we'll be in the bar, arnold.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you all right, arnold?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{yeah, i'm all right, it's just ...}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{look, i'm just sitting here, fellows. did i say anything? i was just sitting here.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{you want to come with me, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, arnold.}
<A>__{charlie scowls at the suggestion, but there is something pleading in arnold's face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you want me to? all right. i will go up with you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(from halfway down the street)}
<D>__{where you going, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will go up with him. moral support.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what the we'll all go with you.}
<A>__{charlie waves him away.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(walks back to fellows)}
<D>__{we'll be down at the bar.}
<A>__{charlie nods. arnold looks briefly at the woman and then away again. she turns and goes up the steps into the building, her leather heels clicking on the stone steps. arnold, head down, and charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her.}
