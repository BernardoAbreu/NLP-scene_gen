<L>__{interior waitress' car}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{so, where do you want me to drop you?}
<A>__{starks rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it over. she watches him curiously.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you don't have anywhere to stay?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{the waitress takes out a flask and a sizable swig from it; she swallows it smoothly, like someone used to doing so.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{well, where are you from?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm not sure. [beat] i don't really know.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{of course you don't know.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why "of course"?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. it'd be too simple. i probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.}
<A>__{she looks over at him momentarily suspicious. he looks back innocuously; there's something innately safe about him.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{at least you're honest. that's some kind of start.}
<A>__{starks sees her take another drink from the flask. she pulls out a cigarette, and starks lights it for her with some}
<B>__{matches.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{that's great. you're not sure where you're from or where you're going, but at least you've got manners.}
<A>__{she laughs, noticeably more relaxed now after the drink.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{well, you got a coat or something? starks [looking down at his clothes] no. doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{well, how'd you get here?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] i was dropped off.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{do you have a motel or something? money?}
<A>__{starks feels his pockets.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{well, don't you somewhere? stuff? belongings?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. [beat] not around here.}
<A>__{she casts a long sideward glance at starks, taking him and her circumstances in for herself. he looks back gently.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{all right, we'll get to my place and call around, see where i can take you. [beat] just don't think of trying anything.}
<C>__{waitress }
<D>__{i have the biggest defense for gun control living upstairs from me. she's armed and angry even when she's asleep.}
