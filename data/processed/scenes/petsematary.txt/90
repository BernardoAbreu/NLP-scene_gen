<A>__{she is crying silently.}
<L>__{interior ellie's bedroom night}
<A>__{she is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. an oblong shaft of light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. she's asleep with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her mouth.}
<L>__{interior the doorway, with rachel}
<A>__{rachel looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly closes the door.}
<L>__{interior louis's and rachel's bedroom night}
<A>__{louis is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the bed. there a number of medical books scattered around him and he's making notes from one as rachel comes in.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she's finally asleep.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{she was a little over excited, that's all. poor kid.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it was that place. that creepy cemetery up in the woods. whatever disease the kids in this town have got, i don't want ellie to catch it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{jesus, rachel, what's got into you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{do you think i didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? here she is thinking church is going to die.}
<A>__{it should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, rachel is much more upset than ellie was. louis slowly puts his notebook aside and caps his pen.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{rachel...someday church is going to die.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{that is hardly the point! church is not going to die today, or tomorrow never mind. i can see you don't have the slightest idea what i'm talking about.}
<A>__{she stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. louis follows. she goes in and slams the door. he goes for the knob.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{rachel !}
<A>__{sound: click of the lock. louis stares at the door, bewildered and upset.}
