<L>__{exterior compound main entrance late day}
<A>__{sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the walls. security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate. a maze of concrete jersey barriers to slow all entering vehicles: give machine gun emplacements flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles if need be. middle eastern police platoons. 500 lbs. lift gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through. sergeant haytham: a lean, 27 year old middle eastern policeman in command of the entrance. sweats through his uniform. a late model range rover with blacked out windows queues up. all the windows roll down: just a single, portly white woman behind the wheel, her infant child in a car seat in front. two other uniformed officers mirror scan the bottom of the rover. a brief exchange, as haytham checks his id:}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{how are you today, sergeant?}
<C>__{haytham}
<D>__{sun is shining. wind is blowing. how bad can i be doing?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i like that, "sun is shining..."}
<A>__{a tight smile from haytham. the other officers are checking the inside of the rover now. they nod to haytham, haytham hands the id back to her. windows rolls up. lift gate goes up. range rover pulls away, navigating the zig zag jersey barriers.}
