<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room moments later}
<A>__{eliot leads vincent to frank's covered body. vincent looks over at anna. the white sheet only comes to her shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{your brother's here.}
<A>__{vincent turns back to eliot. we're not sure if eliot was speaking to frank or to vincent. eliot pulls the sheet away. frank's face is flawless. no sign of any damage.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{he looks so peaceful. you've done a beautiful job. thank you.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you should remember him as he used to be.}
<A>__{suddenly we hear a faint rustling sound. vincent glances again at anna's body. her head is now turned to one side. wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? vincent's puzzled for a second then shrugs. must have been his imagination.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's the schoolteacher isn't it?}
<A>__{eliot pulls the sheet over anna's face.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{yes. very tragic. now is there anything else i can help you with?}
<A>__{vincent frowns. turns back to eliot.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{something's not right here.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(looks up sharply)}
<D>__{not right?}
<A>__{vincent nods towards frank's body.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{his smile. it was a bit more...}
<A>__{vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find the right word.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{...smiley.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{smiley.}
<A>__{on frank's mouth eliot manipulates frank's lips.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{a touch more.}
<B>__{prep room}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's much better. thank you.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i'm glad i could help.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you mind if i have a couple of minutes alone with him?}
<A>__{eliot hesitates. then smiles.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. not at all. i will wait outside.}
<A>__{as eliot leaves, vincent looks at frank's body. after a moment he glances at anna again. then at the door. he quickly moves over to anna. looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. he reaches over... and caresses her breast. mesmerized by her naked body. as vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. instruments crash to the floor. he pulls back the sheet just as eliot enters the room.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't see...}
<A>__{eliot notices the sheet covering anna's body is slightly askew. he reaches over and straightens it. then looks coldly at vincent. there's an uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{well. i guess i should be off then. i will see you at the service. thanks again.}
<A>__{vincent glances one last time at anna then leaves. the door locking shut behind him. eliot stares at the door.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i just told you. that was your brother.}
<P>__{(turns to frank)}
<D>__{you had an accident. you're dead. why do you people never listen to me?}
<A>__{frank doesn't move. his mouth still wired shut.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. it's not a gift. it's a curse.}
<A>__{eliot picks up a compact. roughly layers frank's cheeks with thick rouge. with every word he gets more agitated.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i take care of each of you as if you were my children. i wash the shit from your bodies. i dress you. i do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. and what do you do?}
<A>__{eliot's extremely irritated now. he grabs a garish red lipstick. smears frank's lips.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you argue with me. as if it were my fault you're dead. as if i was to blame.}
<P>__{(slams down the lipstick.)}
<D>__{what? you're not talking to me now? you don't want to?}
<A>__{on frank's face the crudely drawn bright red lips. clown like circles of rouge. gaudy and macabre.}
<C>__{eliot }
<D>__{you don't talk because you have nothing to say. and you have nothing to say because you're a corpse.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{from eliot's reaction it seems as if frank has started to talk again.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. now i don't want to talk to you anymore.}
