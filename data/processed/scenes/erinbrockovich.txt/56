<L>__{interior irving house, garage day}
<A>__{close on a box, with "chrom info" scrawled on it.}
<C>__{donna }
<D>__{pg&e came around a few years ago, told us they put chromium in our well by mistake. and since we shouldn't have to drink it if we don't want to, they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house.}
<A>__{widen to see donna pulling the box down into the room.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what's chromium?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{it's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick }
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i thought the same thing, right off the bat. that's why we went to see the doctor. but hunh uh. turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.}
<A>__{she rifles through the box.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{this is the info they gave us. you'll see if you look through it, chromium's good for you. when i saw what they charged for it at the health food stores, i about fainted.}
<A>__{she hands erin a printed fact sheet. erin scans it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{seems like an awful big coincidence your water being messed with and you being so sick.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{not around here. this is a rough part of the world. hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this. heck, even our dogs up and die.}
