<D>__{i'm serious. grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly aqua netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds }
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{i'm at the point where i'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the company...}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all we did was say the word "max" and they blew up a building. cia even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike.}
