<B>__{several tv reporters}

<C>__{reporter}
<P>__{(to her camera) )}
<D>__{as l. a. p. d. officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes?}
<A>__{parker and madison make their way through the curious trying to see what's going on. several reporters double take parker, then quickly instruct their photographers to take shots of him. parker and madison present their identification to the cops keeping the curious at bay.}
<D>__{cop #1}
<P>__{(recognizing parker)}
<D>__{son...of...a...bitch.}
<A>__{parker and madison continue toward the house. getting an increasing amount of attention, particularly from the other cops. some look on with awe. some with disdain. but nobody is in between.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(quietly to parker)}
<D>__{you ready for this?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{don't worry. if i can't handle it, i will just kill everybody.}
<A>__{he gives her a brief smile. which madison does not return. one of the other policemen tentatively approaches parker.}
<D>__{cop #2 i've always wanted to tell you that if the same thing happened to me, i would do the exact same thing as you if i had the balls.}
<A>__{he extends his hand to parker, who shakes it.}
<D>__{cop #3}
<P>__{(to cop #2)}
<D>__{then you'd be a disgrace to the badge, too.}
<A>__{he turns to parker, who is looking right at him. not with anger. not with any emotion, really. but it's enough to scare the shit out of cop #3, who walks away.}
<B>__{inside the suburban home}
<A>__{investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable. parker and madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes. lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims: the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. their bodies were left in similar condition to reilly's. except their heads have been interchanged. parker and madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall. it reads: death to the pigs.}

<P>__{(knowledgeably)}
<D>__{he was reenacting charles manson's labianca murders.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{charlie? you say that like you're close, personal friends.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{i've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate. after seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.}

<D>__{the question is, what does charlie have to do with sid 6.7?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i know who would know.}
