<A>__{he drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again.}

<D>__{think! we need a little resilience around here!}

<C>__{batty}
<D>__{where are those balls of yours?! let's see a little bravery!}

<A>__{he drops him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i will be down the hall when you're ready.}
<A>__{betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo ment, then punches it with his fist. on his feet he's a little wobbly. holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens. no sound. no sign of batty. the laser is laying nearby. he doesn't bother. deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can. he had a job to do. he would like to have done it, but he's not insane. he gets to the landing and turns. on the first step down, he stops. batty's on the land ing below, looking up at him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{he wait a moment for deckard's answer.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{no cheating. a promise is a promise. i will honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor. you go get your laser gun now. and i will give you a few seconds before i come.}
<A>__{deckard turns back into the hall. batty smiles. deckard's running down the corridor.}
<C>__{batty's voice}
<D>__{one!}
<A>__{halfway down the hall he finds his laser.}
<C>__{batty's voice}
<D>__{two!}
<A>__{deckard darts into the nearest door. the apartment above sebastian's, with the hole in the floor. deckard considers it.}
<C>__{batty's voice}
<D>__{no fair jumping through holes. you might get hurt doing that! three!}
<A>__{deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in.}
