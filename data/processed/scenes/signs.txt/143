<L>__{interior upstairs hall evening}
<A>__{graham and merrill stare up at the ceiling. there is movement right above them. dust falls from a ceiling light right next to them. the rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. they watch as it begins to twitch and sway. the springs in the trap door begins to groan. the door starts to fall open. merrill and graham raise their arms above their head and reach up. the door opens a few inches. merrill is taller. the door presses against his fingers first. it gives a few more inches before merrill stops it. graham's finger are barely touching it. merrill's face turns red with strain as something pushes down on the door.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{this is a very temporary solution.}
<A>__{graham brings his arms down. he sees his children watching from the bottom of the stairs. graham looks around where he is. there is a very small table with photos against a wall. a laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors... nothing else. graham turns to merrill.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{how temporary?}
<A>__{merrill's face is a deep crimson.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{twenty two seconds.}
<A>__{graham looks around again... the same things... the same table... the same closet... graham stops and stares at the closet. it has a wooden folding door that opens and closed on a guide rail. the wooden folding door is very tall. its top is one foot from the ceiling. graham goes to the closet and grabs the door. he starts rocking it hard. pulling it out... it starts to come out of its guide rail... graham leans back with all his weight... the thin wooden door rips out of place. one end is still attached at the hinge. graham pulls it straight. it reaches into the middle of the landing. it stands right next to merrill. right under the attic trapdoor. its top is only a few inches lower than merrill's reach.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{let go.}
<A>__{merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor. it connects with the top of the closet door and stops. the trapdoor is now open almost a foot... we can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic. merrill and graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door. after a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up. the trapdoor closes. beat. it opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a thud. the attic trapdoor closes again. opens again with force.}
<B>__{thud.}
<A>__{the closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright. graham moves down the stairs. merrill follows him.}
