<L>__{ext int night parked car in street}
<A>__{a young couple are snogging in the back of a parked car. music is playing on the radio. they are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse drawn box as it trundles past.}
<L>__{ext night the town hall clock}
<A>__{the clock shows and strikes 2am.}
<L>__{ext night a dingy back street}
<A>__{the wagon has stopped. the back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals. shadowy figures manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof. while this is happening the camera tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street. a group of drunken youths emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. the lads grope the girls. everyone's having "a great time". they see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what the...!}
<A>__{we now see what they see. the wagon has been converted into a stage. we're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. the pediment above the stage carries the words: the astonishing imaginarium of doctor parnassus. percy, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (anton, 18 19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as mercury, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals.}
<D>__{anton mercury ladies and gentlemen... step up! step up!... i, mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of doctor parnassus!}
<A>__{percy does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind anton mercury rises to reveal doctor parnassus he appears to be an indian holy man long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose fitting swath of white cloth apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (he's sitting on a glass plinth). doctor parnassus is seemingly in a trance. a bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd)}
<D>__{doctor parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. a secret learned in the mystic east. let doctor parnassus open your imagination. let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... if you dare. but... beware... there are dangers. you will have to choose. will your soul fly?... or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? the choice is yours and yours alone. transcend the heights on beauty's wing.}
<A>__{a young woman, valentina,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut out trees representing a forest... this is `beauty'. she turns and steps forward. anton takes her hand. they make a couple of dance steps together. they look enchanting and enchanted.}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd) (to the audience)}
<D>__{or, if you must...}
<A>__{now percy, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd)}
<D>__{... scour the squalid depths with putrid's brother, stench!}
<A>__{percy indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of the stage.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{take a ticket and join the queue! only five quid a go! there's no greater bargain on planet earth!}
<A>__{a beer bottle lands on the stage the drunken youths cheer.}
<D>__{anton mercury you choose... fulfilment, grace and light or... waste, filth and darkness.}
<P>__{(under his breath,}
<D>__{watching the drunk,}
<P>__{martin, with contempt)}
<D>__{no prizes for guessing what you'll do.}
<A>__{martin has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage. his mates laugh and shout encouragement.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(not in character.. he stutters)}
<D>__{no. sorry. that's n not allowed. you have to t take a t ticket first.}
<A>__{anton tries to prevent martin from getting on stage. but martin thumps anton and pulls him into the `audience'. martin's drunken mates laugh and applaud. martin is now on stage and heading for doctor parnassus who is still in a trance. percy tries to head him off but martin shoves percy off the stage. percy lands on the ground with a crash. more laughter from the mob.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(drunkenly to parnassus)}
<D>__{hey you...i wanna audition. i wan... i wanna be a star... i wanna...}
<A>__{martin is on the verge of tweaking doctor parnassus' nose or pulling his beard when valentina diverts him.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{stop! get off the stage!}
<A>__{martin turns his bleary focus to valentina.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{thas a nice pair of jugs.}
<A>__{martin's mates roar their approval.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{get off the stage!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no. i wan you... i wan you...}
<A>__{martin lunges at `beauty' who retreats up stage. martin blunders into the scenery as he pursues `beauty' who stays just out of reach. she takes cover behind a cut out tree. anton and percy climb back onto the stage as martin continues to chase `beauty'. valentina evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). martin crashes after her. anton and percy exchange worried looks. they look at doctor parnassus. should they wake him from his trance? they decide not to but it's a difficult decision.}
