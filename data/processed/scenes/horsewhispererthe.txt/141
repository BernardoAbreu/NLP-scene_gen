<L>__{exterior the ranch, pasture day}
<A>__{annie, in levis and a jacket, rides rimrock beside tom across the pasture. we overhear them in the midst of talking.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{relax our center... it's just sitting in a bucket.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yeah, it's been a while, but i... i remember the basic ideas...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ok. i will stop talking then.}
<A>__{he rides a few steps ahead as annie realizes she doesn't remember. she just went into automatic "i don't have to be told anything" mode.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{actually, i never rode western. i'm sorry. go ahead.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, he don't know that. just sit the horse.}
<P>__{(watches her ride)}
<D>__{good... you have a nice seat.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{feel good?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you look all right. you want to pick it up a little?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{tom urges his horse into a center. annie canters alongside.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{watch your reins, he'll go with you, give him some room, let him do the work. relax, don't grab him with your thighs, just so long as he can feel your body.}
<A>__{annie responds to every suggestion without resistance. and she experiences this sense of pleasure this great animal beneath her, the physicality and the surrender of letting someone else lead...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you want to let it go some more?}
<A>__{she begins to let herself go, losing herself in the experience. she just nods... tom breaks into a full gallop... annie follows suit... she lets everything go her job, her marriage, motherhood, guilt, anxiety... all of it. her only focus is the horse beneath her, and the man on the horse leading her...}
