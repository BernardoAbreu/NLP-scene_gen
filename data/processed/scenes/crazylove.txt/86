<A>__{mrs. hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her christmas stocking cap. she starts to dispense erasers.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what's she doing?}
<A>__{mrs. hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on grandma rosa. she hands rosa the gift meant for her daughter.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{rosa, rosa, you must have this, rosa.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{grazie.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{mrs. hallstrom, join us. please.}
<A>__{but, by this point, mrs. hallstrom's already bounded away, divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children. she clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{merry christmas to all. ho, ho, ho, ho.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{michael, we've got to stop her.}
<A>__{michael pushes back his chair. he's trapped between the table and the wall.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{my goodness, it's so very warm in here. so warm.}
<A>__{she takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man. but she doesn't stop there. with haphazard abandon, she begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{way, way, way too warm for december. now, let's sing jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...}
<A>__{the group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior. then, almost as one, the patients spring into action. michael bolts over his dining table and runs to mrs. hallstrom. he jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her. by this time, john, thomas and letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave. michael sets mrs. hallstrom on the ground. she looks up at the group, and continues belting out}

<D>__{what else would you do?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. and we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{and we'd eat spaghetti o's in bed from the can.}
