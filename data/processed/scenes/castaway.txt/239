<A>__{the fish return. chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it down.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{can't kill another one. can't. can't kill my friends anymore.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{why do they have to die for me?}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they'd eat you if they could. they're laughing at you. listen.}
<A>__{chuck listens. doesn't hear anything.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{got to eat.}
<A>__{chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses. suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear. it struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its head, twists the stone knife into its spine. the struggling stops. chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i am so sorry.}
<A>__{he cries uncontrollably. as he cries he cuts off the head, pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one. then he sucks the marrow out of the head. then takes the heart and eats that. then eats the liver. as he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips. when he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks on it. fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.}
