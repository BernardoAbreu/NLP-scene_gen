<L>__{interior town hall day}
<A>__{a hurriedly called meeting of the town's selectmen is in session: vaughn, peterson, and three others: kaiser, an old man still in his grocery clerk's apron; sansom; and nichols, the woman on the beach.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{brody's a good man.}
<C>__{kaiser}
<D>__{nobody says he isn't.}

<C>__{sansom}
<D>__{that's what we're here to do.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{all right. let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy.}
<A>__{angle from inside vaughn's office as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. vaughn deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the room.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i believe we have a quorum, and informally, i suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes...}
