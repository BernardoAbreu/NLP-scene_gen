<A>__{pitch runs through the shadows in terror. he comes crashing through the trees of the forest, and out onto the ice of the pond. he looks over his shoulder to see if the guardians are on his tail, when boom! he runs smack into north's chest. pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. he looks up to see north smiling down at him.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{leaving the party so soon?}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{you didn't even say goodbye.}
<A>__{tooth tosses something to pitch which he catches. he looks down. it's a quarter.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{a quarter?}
<A>__{blam. a fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single tooth goes skittering across the ice. tooth shakes out her hand.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{and that's for my fairies.}
<C>__{pitch}
<P>__{(scowls)}
<D>__{you can't get rid of me! not forever! there will always be fear!}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{so what? as long as one child believes, we will be here to fight fear!}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{really? then what are they doing here?}
<A>__{hundreds of nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the pond. it's terrifying, but the guardians seem unphased.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{they can't be my nightmares, i'm not afraid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{looks like it's your fear they smell. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 130.}
<A>__{suddenly, pitch's eyes get huge with terror as the nightmares move in on him. he begins to back away, but the nightmares pick up speed as they charge toward him.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{ahhh, no....aaaaahhhhhh!!}
<A>__{he tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on the ice. he falters, and is swept up in the stampede of nightmares. the streaks of black whip and latch themselves onto pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{no, no, nooooooo!}
<A>__{pitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed, and back down into the dark depths of the underground. he looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the earth seals itself up.}
