<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{...the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?}
<A>__{lucy's in her best dress, being sworn in. one hand in the air.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{so help me god...}
<A>__{and now camera moves around her and we see that she's hiding her other hand behind her back fingers crossed.}
<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{lucy is on the stand, turner is cross examining her.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{i heard you turned seven this year. that's pretty exciting.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{everybody gets older. it's not that big a deal.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{what'd you get for your birthday?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i haven't opened my presents yet.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{really? that's odd. why not?}
<A>__{lucy looks to her father and rita.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i opened my presents. i got the help album limited edition.}
<B>__{on rita and sam}
<A>__{what is she doing?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i was confused. i thought you didn't open your birthday presents because you ran away from your own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i never said that; why would i say that?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{why would your friends say it if you hadn't said it?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{kids lie all the time.}
<A>__{next to her skirt, we see her fingers are crossed so hard they're practically turning purple.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{may i remind you lucy that you're under oath?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you may.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{and do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so now that you and i have agreed to tell the truth, where did you sleep last night?}
<A>__{rita glares at margaret. thanks a lot.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{in my bed at the foster home.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{all right, lucy. if you're not going to tell the truth, i am. your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here. you're lying right now because you're afraid. afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are. you're afraid of hurting him, but now we need to tell the truth. the truth is deep inside you know you're not getting what you need from your father. isn't that right, lucy?}
<A>__{a long silence. she stares at turner defiantly.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{"all you need is love."}
