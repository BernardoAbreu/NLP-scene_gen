<A>__{the jailer exits from d'artagnan's cell, closes the heavy door behind him. a closer look reveals d'artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. he looks left and right dank corridors, darkness, the occasional groan. and steps lightly into the shadows. on d'artagnan he seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. two jailers converse, step towards him. d'artagnan leaps into a cell doorway, allows them to pass. suddenly: scabrous hands reach from inside the cell, grab d'artagnan by the throat. he shudders, leaps free. and continues. d'artagnan steps deeper in the labyrinth. frustrated, no way out. just then: more footsteps heading toward him. d'artagnan seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps into view, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers. d'artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.}
