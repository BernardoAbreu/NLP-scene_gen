<A>__{robert e. lee comes down the steps of the mclean house, as a confederate officer brings his horse to him. his face is blank. lee mounts his waiting horse. lee should leave, having just surrendered to grant inside; but he's immobile. some of the officers of both sides look at lee, some can't bear it. lee tries out various expressions: pride, defiance, blankness. grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his staff. among them is robert lincoln. grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that lee's still there, astride his horse. everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another. then grant removes his famous slouch hat. everyone freezes for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the union army remove their hats. lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. he raises his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. then, pulling slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.}
