<A>__{a funeral. taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party. when everyone is gone, hull approaches the grave. from his pocket, he removes the four blood soaked bills his father gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot. he's silent a moment, then he gets up. he joins carver who's standing with hull's children. the kids each take his hand, they walk together.}

<D>__{you know the difference between a black man and a nigger?}
<A>__{carver smiles, shakes his head. he likes a good joke. hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.}
