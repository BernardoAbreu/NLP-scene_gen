<A>__{as ethan enters. a body look's is sprawled on the ground. he crosses, turns her over. martin enters behind him.}

<D>__{well, you're a widower now...}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{what'd the soldiers have to kill her for!...}
<A>__{he sees something clutched in her hand. he stoops quickly.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ethan!}
<A>__{ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses. martin shows him what look had been clutching debbie's rag doll.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{look! it's hers, debbie's...}
<A>__{ethan snatches it, stares at it. then he turns and runs from the tepee. martin stares at look's body, then covers it with a robe.}
<C>__{martin's voice}
<D>__{so we knew debbie had been in the village... what look was doing there whether she'd come to warn them, or maybe to find debbie for me... there's no way of knowing...}
<A>__{he turns and then slowly heads out.}
