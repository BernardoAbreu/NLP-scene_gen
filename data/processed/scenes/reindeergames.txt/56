<L>__{interior tomahawk day}
<A>__{rudy and ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket of quarters. rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two security guards punch a code in a private door, step inside:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{so does it look a lot different?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{here and there. restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.}
<A>__{they settle at a slot machine. another security guard walks past them. rudy turns his back. ashley notices.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{that guy knows you?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.}
<A>__{at the door, merlin and jumpy enter, wandering through the slots. rudy sees them.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you start spending your brother's money. i'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. i will snag us some drinks.}
<A>__{as he strides away }
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{be careful, nick...}
<B>__{moving through the casino}
<A>__{with rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking out the layout. in reality, he's surveying the gamblers. passing the cage, he walks right by jack bangs and the indian governors. jack bangs is all smiles, while the governors turn their backs an him and storm out.}
<B>__{arriving at the bar}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{couple rum and cokes, please.}
<C>__{indian bartender}
<D>__{you want that rum and coke or rum and pepsi?}
<A>__{rudy gives him a strange look. the bartender shrugs. rudy still scans the tables, settling on }
<B>__{a blackjack table}
<A>__{where a trio of college kids are forking over chips. one of them's dark haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. rudy studies this kid for moment.}
<C>__{jack bangs }
<D>__{gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.}
<B>__{back at the bar}
<A>__{jack bangs sidles up, distraught. the barkeep hands him a bottle. bangs takes a swig.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{i can't go back to vegas, bear. they'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? i can't go back...}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what does the tribe want?}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{they want gold paved roads is what they want. talking 'bout the fuckin' paiutes. fuckin' paiutes are on the interstate. nothing i can do about that, man, i didn't pick the spot for your reservation.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{neither did we.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, whatever.}
<A>__{rudy gets his drinks, as jack bangs turns his way:}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{hey. hey, cowboy. jack bangs, i run the place. nice to have you in the tomahawk. tell me something...}
<A>__{rudy winces, glancing to see merlin and jumpy watching him. frowns on their faces.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{...does upstate michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate michigan need an international gaming destination?}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(wants outta here)}
<D>__{roadside casino?}
<A>__{jack bangs, smile falls flat.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{well, so how'd you hear about this place, then. word of mouth? mass mailings? cable tv?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{prison.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{prison?!}
<A>__{rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. bangs looks sick, turns to a fat guy on the next stool over. but before he can ask, the guy shakes his head }
<C>__{fat guy}
<D>__{i just stopped in to use the can.}
<A>__{bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands:}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{i can't go back to vegas, bear... i can't...}
<A>__{from the slots, we hear a jackpot payoff.}
<C>__{jack bangs}
<D>__{aw fuck.}
<B>__{through the tables}
<A>__{walks rudy, as merlin sidles up next to him:}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what the hell was that about }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{he didn't recognize me. back off, willya? he didn't recognize me.}
<A>__{merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. as he nears ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where the college kid has left... heading for the bathroom }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{hey nick! we're up fifty cents!}
<A>__{ and as a barely dressed cocktail waitress crosses between rudy and ashley, blocking her view of him rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and coke into his own face }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{heyyyy!}
<A>__{reaching ashley, his goatee is dripping }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nick, what happened }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{there went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i gotta fix this thing }
<P>__{(hands her his glass)}
<D>__{ drink this for me.}
<A>__{he hustles for the bathroom. a moment later, jumpy storms by. stops at ashley.}
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{he started losing his hair.}
