<L>__{exterior another street paris day}
<A>__{the eiffel tower fills our eyes. and then we pull back to reveal that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street. and now we're moving down the street, until we come to a store whose sign advertises in english hong kong movies. the windows of the store are filled with posters. we move through to}
<L>__{interior the store same time}
<A>__{tony simon, an expatriate black american, runs this place and lives above it. his shelves are lined with action films made in the far east. tony knows everything there is to know about the films he sells but he also knows quite a bit about what's going on in the parisian underworld. he's a professional information broker. right now he's talking to a customer in perfect french, with english subtitles.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{hey, man, they're both great movies. one is more of a character study, the other is more of a straight action thing, but they're great movies, and he's an amazing fucking filmmaker.}
<A>__{tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{excuse me...}
<A>__{vincent and sam have entered the store. sam's ability to be back on his feet in such a short time is amazing but we can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the film. what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of will. now tony moves to join them, and the conversation immediately turns to english.}

<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{my man, how you doing?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm alright. and you?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{doing well.}
<P>__{(with a look at sam)}
<D>__{this is?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{a friend. i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{why don't we step into my office...}
<A>__{tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the counter. tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{so what can i do for you?}
<A>__{vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking. the place is empty except for the single customer tony was just talking to. the customer is still considering the two films tony was showing him.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{matter of face there's this flick i've been hearing about. i haven't seen it, but from what i hear it's pretty cool.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's the story?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's an international thing. several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job. but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together. an unlikely group of partners.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you have the tape?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i might know where you could get a copy.}
<A>__{the customer approaches the counter. he has both tapes with him.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(to vincent and sam)}
<D>__{let me do some business with my boy here, and i will meet you across the street in five. i gotta make homes here feel like he's getting a good deal while i give him the pleasure of overpaying me for a couple of second generation pirates.}
