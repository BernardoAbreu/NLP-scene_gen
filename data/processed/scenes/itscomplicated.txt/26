<L>__{exterior house later}
<A>__{blue prints are spread on a garden table. adam is drawing as jane watches.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{ so if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes, i'd love that.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sketching)}
<D>__{thought so.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have an idea... what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so i can get more of the morning light?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(sees adam hesitate)}
<D>__{not possible?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{ yes, but you'll wake up in the morning, open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ahhh! forgot it was all open up there!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but i get where you're headed. let me see what i can do... this property is so great... have you lived here a long time?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{about ten years. i bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this....}
<A>__{jane and adam are distracted when a porsche noisily pulls up and jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{good morning!}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{am i interrupting...?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(thrown that he's here)}
<D>__{hi. no, well, we were just about done. adam, this is my ex husband, jake. jake, this is adam schaeffer, my architect.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(they shake hands)}
<D>__{good to meet you.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(re: plans)}
<D>__{can i take a look? do you mind?}
<A>__{adam looks to jane for approval but too late, jake's already looking.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{everything's not 100% worked out yet...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{wow. you're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{huge bedroom.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it's not huge.}
<P>__{(suddenly insecure)}
<D>__{why don't i show these to you when we get a little closer.}
<A>__{jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little. adam finishes for her. she thanks him with her eyes.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so, i think next we should stake out the addition... see how it all feels size wise...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{sounds great.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i will e mail you and we'll set it up. we did good work today. jake, nice meeting you.}
<A>__{jake smiles and waves as adam exits, walking to his car.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turns to jane)}
<D>__{got time for a cup of coffee?}
<A>__{adam can't help but sneak a look back at them. jane waves, a bit embarrassed.}
