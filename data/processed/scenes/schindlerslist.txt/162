<L>__{exterior depot plaszow later day}
<A>__{waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars. inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled. schindler's mercedes pulls up. he climbs out and stares transfixed. he notices goeth then, standing with the other industrialists, bosch and madritsch, and strolls over to them.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{i tried to call you, i'm running a little late, this is taking longer than i thought. have a drink.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{i got a shipment of hungarians coming in, i got to make room for them. it's always something.}
<A>__{he glances away at the train. the idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{they're complaining now? they don't know what complaining is.}
<A>__{he grins. schindler watches as another car is loaded. it's like they're climbing into an oven.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars?}
<A>__{goeth stares at him blankly, then with a what will you think of next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls over to hujar }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{bring the fire trucks!}
<C>__{hujar}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it. stream of water cascade onto the scalding rooftops. the fire trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{this is really cruel, oskar, you're giving them hope. you shouldn't do that, that's cruel.}
<A>__{and amusing, not just to goeth, but to the other ss officers standing around as well. oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen. at full extension, apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars. he returns to goeth.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i've got some 200 meter hoses back at d.e.f., we can reach the cars down at the end.}
<A>__{goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{hujar!}
<A>__{the d.e.f. hoses have arrived and are being coupled to plaszow's. as the water drenches the cars further back, the people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{what does he think he's saving them from?}
<A>__{the joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the d.e.f. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. accompanied by the laughter of the ss, schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{goeth is almost hysterical. but slowly then, slowly, the amusement on his face fades. his friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless ss men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly here, it's as though he were possessed. the water rains down on the last car.}
