<L>__{exterior riverside day}
<A>__{will gets out of the chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. behind him, sandra, josephine and dr. bennett pull up. karl comes just after that. crossing to the passenger side, will lifts his father out. strangely, he's gotten even lighter. will carries him easily. edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. he hands them to josephine. she throws them up at the powerline. they loop over. applause and cheers. the crowd parts to let will and edward get to the river. as he passes, edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{and the strange thing is, there's not a sad face to be found. everyone's just so glad to see you, and send you off right.}
<A>__{will walks into the river, up to his knees. he turns back so his father can face the crowd. edward waves.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{goodbye everybody! farewell! adieu!}
<C>__{the crowd }
<D>__{goodbye edward! see ya! we'll miss you!}
<A>__{but one face is missing from the crowd sandra. will turns to see she's already standing in the river beside them. the reflection of the light off the water gives sandra an unearthly glow. she's more tranquil and more beautiful than we've ever seen her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my girl in the river.}
<A>__{she kisses him. he tweaks her chin. the crowd hollers in approval, but their moment remains strangely private. only will is there to witness. as the kiss ends, edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. but it's stuck. finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free with his teeth. a look to will, a smile with a glint of gold. will takes the ring out of his mouth. edward suddenly drops out of will's arms with a splash. for he's no longer a man, but rather}
<B>__{a fat catfish}
<A>__{swimming at his feet. we watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing. will and his mother stand knee deep in the water, watching edward bloom swim away into the sunlight. josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd. music builds to a climax, then... down the river, a giant fish suddenly jumps out of the water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. it then dives back under with a splash.}
