<A>__{the freeway is packed bumper to bumper. cars standing still in the hot sun. a hispanic man in his late forties, juan is seated in his dodge caravan when he sees someone in his rearview mirror. a man is using a stick as a cane. the struggling man makes his way along the shoulder very slowly. juan reaches over to his passenger seat and turns over the l.a. times. under the heading, "he's back!" is maurice's picture. juan quickly rolls down his window as maurice passes by on the shoulder.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{hey, maurice man keep going buddy!}
<A>__{maurice is startled at the man's yell, but then smiles when the words register. maurice struggles forward. juan keeps yelling encouragements... this grabs the attention of other drivers who realize who is walking past them. one by one, car doors open and people call to maurice.}
<C>__{overweight woman}
<D>__{don't stop maurice!}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{go mr. parker!}
<A>__{cars start to honk... more and more people turn to see the commotion... the yelling and honking is joined by whistles and cheers maurice can't believe it he tries to smile but can't hold it. his face tightens with every step. his shirt is soiled with blood. he raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the car.}
