<L>__{interior hotel ballroom day}
<A>__{the annual teldar paper stockholders' meeting is in session:}
<L>__{400 stockholders are there many middle aged and older,}
<A>__{one bag lady. cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky executives, none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, accountants and lawyers. gekko in contrast seems like robin hood seated with alex, harold, bud and the other stockholders. cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on gekko in a highly sarcastic, gruff manner.}
<C>__{cromwell}
<D>__{...your company, ladies and gentlemen, is under siege from gordon gekko. teldar paper is now leveraged to the hilt, like some piss poor south american country...instead of using our cash to build plants, build our business, all this man really wants is to get paid to withdraw his tender offer and that will cost us approximately another $200 million in greenmail which will be passed on to the consumer...}
<A>__{gekko seething, jumps up.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{where do you get off speaking about me like that, making remarks to the press, i resent these remarks, i demand the right to speak.}
<C>__{cromwell}
<D>__{sit down, sir, you're out of order, haven't you done enough damage to teldar as it is?...have you no sense of decency?}
<P>__{(to shareholders)}
<D>__{how can your management...}
<A>__{gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various catcalls, "let the man speak!" "sit down, gekko!"}
<C>__{cromwell }
<D>__{...concentrate on long term growth when we're busy fighting the get rich quick, short term profit, slot machine mentality of wall street when we should be fighting japan! the original fundamental reason for wall street was to capitalize american business, underwrite new business, build companies, build america. the "deal" has now succeeded goods and services as america's gross national product and in the process, we are undermining our foundation. this cancer is called "greed". greed and speculation have replaced long term investment. corporations are being taken apart like erector sets, without any consideration of the public good. i strongly recommend you to see through mr. gekko's shameless intention here to strip this company and severely penalize the stockholders. i strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for management's restructuring of the stock.}
