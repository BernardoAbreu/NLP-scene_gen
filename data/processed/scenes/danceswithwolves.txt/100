<L>__{exterior sedgewick day}
<A>__{wind in his hair and kicking bird are sitting comfortably under the awning, each holding steaming army issue cups. they are staring straight ahead with a curious expression. dunbar is turning a handle on a machine. it is a coffee grinder. the last of the beans goes down and dunbar pauses for dramatic effect. then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh grounds and passes it to the medicine man. kicking bird and wind in his hair both sniff the contents. dunbar gestures at their still full mugs neither one of them has taken a drink.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{is the coffee not good? too strong maybe? here...}
<A>__{dunbar reaches for a sack by the fire. holding it in front of him, dunbar suggests that wind in his hair put some of its contents into his mug. wind in his hair finally does, but his blank expression indicates that he doesn't know what difference this could make. dunbar takes a lick at his fingers, suggesting that wind in his hair should do the same. a smile creeps over his face as the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold. wind in his hair has licked every bit off each finger.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(to kicking bird)}
<D>__{do you want some?}
<A>__{wind in his hair doesn't wait for kicking bird's answer. he reaches over and dumps a good amount in kicking bird's cup, adding some more to his own for good measure.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{so what are you guys doing? looking for buffalo?}
<A>__{there is no response. wind in his hair's attention is now on cisco.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{he's a good one... good horse. my horse.}
<A>__{wind in his hair's interest borders on rude. prompted by a light tap on his leg from kicking bird, wind in his hair turns his attention back to dunbar.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{good horse.}
<A>__{no argument from wind in his hair.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{my horse. you see any buffalo?}
<A>__{kicking bird and wind in his hair are baffled. the lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the back of his tunic.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{wait just a bit.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<P>__{(to kicking bird)}
<D>__{his mind is gone.}
<A>__{kicking bird doesn't respond. he's still intent on the lieutenant. in wedging the blanket under his tunic, dunbar has become a hunchback. he bends over in a weird attitude, and with a finger peeking over each side of his head, he begins a bizarre display of dancing, punctuated with snorts and bellows.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{buffalo.}

<P>__{(incorrectly in sioux)}
<D>__{buffalo?}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{buffalo.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(getting it right)}
<D>__{buffalo.}
<A>__{kicking bird nods his assent and dunbar flashes a pleased smile.}
