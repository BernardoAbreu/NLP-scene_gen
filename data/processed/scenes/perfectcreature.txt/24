<A>__{lilly enters her bedroom. the place is a mess. she sits on the bed. she picks up a framed photo which sits on a sideboard next to the bed. it shows lilly, a man lilly's age and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like lilly. she stares at the child. we hear the sound of rain pounding against the window of the bedroom.}
