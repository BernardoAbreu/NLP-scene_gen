<L>__{interior nix's house passageway outside sanctum day}
<A>__{pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.}
<D>__{1st cultist}
<P>__{(with distressing confidence)}
<D>__{you can't kill him. 2nd cultist he'll just rise up again!}
<L>__{interior nix's house sanctum day}
<A>__{on nix, doing just that: rising up. right hand clamped to his bloody chest, left hand reaching for swann.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{quaid fires at him again. strikes his shoulder. and again. strikes his leg. nix collapses to the ground,}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{quickly!}
<A>__{they have come prepared for this. swann now takes from his jacket the three strange pieces of metalwork. there are screws in then all.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(seeing)}
<D>__{swann? what are you doing?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{binding you.}
<A>__{he clamps one of the pieces over nix's eyes. it fits like an eyeless mask. nix thrashes and screams. swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and like magic his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into nix's flesh and bone with a gut wrenching sound. blood runs from the screw holes.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{fuck you, swann! fuck you!}
<A>__{now the second piece, over his mouth.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{sw}
<A>__{he's silenced. the piece screws itself into his head, like the first. and now comes the third and final piece: over the nose and into the ears. again, it screws itself into place. swann has done all he can. he retreats from nix's body, as it continues to convulse. we go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits. why won't he die? and now, at last the violence of nix's death throes diminishes. nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{is it finished?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{it's finished.}
