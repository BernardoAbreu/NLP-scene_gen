<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. the man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle. he is accompanied by a medium sized labrador, and seems in no particular hurry. the sound of tires appear and grow in intensity. the man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. the dog obeys as the man moves off the road. the vehicle hurtles past him its engine quiet, its windows darkened spraying muddy debris in its wake. seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. the car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the man, who remains motionless. when the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a well dressed bureaucrat in the rear seat. his demeanor is pleasant and professional.}
<D>__{well dressed bureaucrat dr. kelvin?}
<A>__{the man he is addressing, who we now understand is chris kelvin, stares back at him.}
