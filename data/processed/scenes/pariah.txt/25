<L>__{interior school bathroom morning}
<A>__{alike slams into her usual stall and launches into her `superman' changing routine. she unrolls pulls a jersey from her backpack and yanks it over her head.}
<L>__{exterior school lawn afternoon}
<A>__{alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. a group of fast girls strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling and yakking on cell phones. one of the girls, mika cuts a flirty smile at alike. alike turns away and buries herself in her book, but cranks down the volume on her ipod.}

<A>__{mika smiles as her eyes travel down alike's physique. alike, aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt unnecessarily. she licks her lips and readjusts the book in her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face.}

<D>__{`sup ladies? mika fast girl #2}
<A>__{heeeey. what's up? the girls erupt into titters, and they melt into conversation. alike deflates, watching them over the top of her book. she observes every little moment between the girls and the boy, every wink. another boy joins the group and they stroll off down the sidewalk. alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them leave. mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at alike. remnant's of alike's grin return reflexively. mika's friend jerks her elbow around.}
