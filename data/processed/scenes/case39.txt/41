<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{emily and barron rush in. emily sees lucy trapped inside the oven. the sleeve of her pajamas catching fire.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{edward tries to fend barron off. it's a mistake. barron unleashes a devastating blow that sends him recoiling into the fridge so hard the back of his head leaves a visible dent in the door. emily shoves margaret aside and throws open the oven. pulls lucy out onto the kitchen floor, swatting out her burning pajamas with a dish towel. margaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at emily, but barron has her covered. backhands margaret so hard it spins her around fully before dropping her to the floor.}

<D>__{the hell's the matter with you people?!}
<A>__{pajamas scorched, wild with terror, lucy cries in great heaving sobs in emily's arms. reduced to tears herself, emily keeps saying the same thing over and over.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i gotcha... i gotcha... i gotcha...}
<A>__{shielding her from the sight of her parents: margaret sprawled on the linoleum weeping. edward slouched against the fridge, blood pouring down his shirt, his broken jaw hanging open like a man thinking wow.}
