<L>__{75 exterior monolith day}
<A>__{the kids climb up on top of the rock bluff before them is a huge black monolith. there's all sorts of charred bones and skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them alien. they approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck silence. in the middle of the monolith there's a large circle with the six animals of the ninjetti carved into it.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{... the nathadian monolith...}
<A>__{kimberly looks at all the bones instinctively puts her hand on her animal symbol.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i guess these guys weren't so lucky.}
<A>__{a few of the kids walk around the monolith, examining it more closely.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{we've come all this way for a rock wall?!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{there should be a way to open it.}
<A>__{billy &;tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for an opening.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{... nothing.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{release the power with the power.}
<A>__{rocky steps back, throws his shoulder into the monolith with a thump, winces in pain.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{not that kind of power.}
<A>__{the kids exchange discouraged looks.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{... there has to be something we're missing.}
<A>__{the kids look crestfallen.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{it can't end like this...}
<A>__{suddenly a sizzle of electricity forms in front of them.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{what now!}
<A>__{the kids mouth's fall open as... a holographic image of zordon's withered face appears. he speaks in a barely audible voice.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{rangers... ivan has invaded the city... time is running out...}
<A>__{zordon's image flickers a few times then stabilizes again.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{each of you are now in possession of miraculous skills... but only when the six become one will you have the strength to harness the great power.}
<A>__{his image flickers then fades away.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{zordon!!}
<A>__{billy studies the circle with zealous eyes.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{six become one... the combined forces of the ninjetti.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{strength in numbers!!}
<A>__{they silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock: hands. they face the monolith with fire in their eyes.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i am the wolf, cunning and swift!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i am the crane, agile and sublime!}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{i am the bear, stalwart and bold!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i am the frog, quick as lightning!}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i am the mighty ape!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and i am the falcon, winged lord of the sky!}
<C>__{rangers}
<D>__{we... are the ninjetti!!!}
<A>__{a mysterious halo of light shrouds the rangers and they dissapear}
