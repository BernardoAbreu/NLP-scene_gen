<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior army post dawn}
<A>__{as haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by stellman is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. haven dismounts and starts inside. he glances at his wagon parked outside. it is the one mrs. caslon took from him. he smiles slightly as he notes it.}
<L>__{interior army post iles' offices dawn}
<A>__{haven walks in, brushes past the desk sergeant with a cursory nod and enters iles' sanctum.}
<L>__{interior iles' office dawn}
<A>__{as haven enters. mrs. caslon is there, and iles, in full field uniform. they look at him quickly as he enters; he pauses, glances at mrs. caslon and then faces the explosive iles.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{that's all right. just barge right in! i'm going to tell you something...}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're going to listen.}
<A>__{as iles stares, dumbfounded, at this impertinence:}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you lost some uniforms? you thought they were burned?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{they were.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no, they weren't, but they are now because i just set fire to them.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{they're smouldering right now in the warehouse at the sawmill, and there are about seventy men down there who were ready to wear them.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{wear them? what for?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what other reason? to get in the post and take the gold from you.}
<A>__{iles gawks at him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you were taking a detachment up north on an indian scare?}
<A>__{iles nods vaguely.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{well, that scare is a fake. a ruse. so you know where to send them now.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{look here, lieutenant }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{correction.}
<A>__{haven dips into a lining pocket under his arm and tosses a paper at iles. iles glances at it, then looks, thunderstruck, at haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{major?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you better get down to that sawmill, captain. they may try it anyway.}
<A>__{iles' expression slowly changes. he smiles at last.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i guess i owe you an apology.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{he shakes hands with iles for second, then iles goes out abruptly. outside we can hear abrupt commands to the sergeant before the door closes. haven takes out his pipe, looks at the silent, dumb struck mrs caslon. he smiles at her slightly. she gets her voice at last.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i guess i owe you something too.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only fifty thousand.}
<A>__{outside "to horse" is sounding. haven glances out the window, hardly aware of mrs caslon's presence.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i wish there was something i could say or do.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{there is. you can give me back my gun.}
<A>__{she goes to the desk, gets it and hands it to him. he takes the gun from his holster and hands it to her.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{and you can give this one back to the sheriff.}
<A>__{she takes it.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i will always remember what a fool i made of myself.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i always try to forget.}
<A>__{he puts his own gun in holster. glances out the window.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(watching his face)}
<D>__{are you going too?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{not with them...}
<A>__{he pats her shoulder in a gesture of goodbye and walks out the door. she stands watching him, then moves to the window and looks out.}
