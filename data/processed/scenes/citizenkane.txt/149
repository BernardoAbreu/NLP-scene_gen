<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{interior kane's office night }
<A>__{the bottle is finished. the door in the sanctrum opens. reilly and the others leave.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(as they go)}
<D>__{goodnight, mr. kane.}
<A>__{kane stands in the door, waiting for leland. leland gets up and moves toward the office goes in, sits down across from kane at the desk. an uncomfortable pause. then kane smiles ingratiatingly. leland tries to cope with this.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{first of all }
<P>__{(he can't go on)}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(not cruelly genuinely kind)}
<D>__{what's wrong, brad?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i'm drunk.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i will get you some coffee.}
<A>__{he rises and goes to the door.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{first of all, i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "enquirer."}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(gently opening the door)}
<D>__{that's just a little promotion scheme. nobody expects you }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{mike, will you try and get mr. leland some coffee?}
<C>__{mike's voice}
<D>__{sure thing, mr. kane.}
<A>__{kane turns back to leland. leland doesn't look up at him.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{charlie, it's just no go. we can't agree anymore. i wish you'd let me go to chicago.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{why, brad?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i want to be transferred to the new paper. you've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to }
<P>__{(he is heartsick, inarticulate)}
<D>__{that's not what i wanted to talk about.}
<A>__{kane goes around behind the desk and sits down.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i will tell you what i will do, brad i will get drunk, too maybe that'll help.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{no, that won't help. besides, you never get drunk. i wanted to talk about you and emily.}
<A>__{kane looks at leland sharply before he speaks.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(without looking at him)}
<D>__{she's going to leave you }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i don't think so, brad. we've just had word that the president is out of danger.}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{it seems i didn't kill him after all.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(takes his eye)}
<D>__{she was going to leave you anyway }
<A>__{kane takes this in.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{emily's going south next week with the child. as far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. when they get back }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{brad, you are drunk.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{sure i am. she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. if you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president's wishes. i can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{why is she leaving me?}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(it's very hard for}
<D>__{him to say all}
<P>__{this)}
<D>__{she hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{do you think the "enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(hesitating)}
<D>__{you might have made the whole thing less personal!}
<A>__{no answer from kane.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{it isn't just that the president was her uncle everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important }
<A>__{still no answer from kane.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{there's no reason why this this savage personal note }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{the personal note is all there is to it. it's all there ever is to it. it's all there every is to anything! stupidity in our government, complacency and self satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you can't fight those things impersonally. they're not impersonal crimes against people. they're being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue, brad, that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you almost convince me.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. i have to be a little drunk for that because i'm a coward. you know that. that's why you keep me around.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you only associate with your inferiors, charlie. i guess that's why you ran away from emily. because you can't stand the company of your equals. you don't like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead. i told you that.}
<A>__{kane looks at leland, but leland can't be stopped now. he speaks very quietly no poison in his voice no personal indignation as though he were explaining the nature of a disease.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you. when you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. remember the working man? you used to defend him quite a good deal. well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. and listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together that's going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i don't know what you'll do sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{are you finished?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{now, will you let me go to chicago?}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(with a little smile)}
<D>__{you're not going to like it in chicago. they wind comes howling in from the lake. and there's practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether they've ever heard of lobster newburg }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<P>__{(he won't be charmed out of his duty)}
<D>__{what are you going to do about emily?}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(his face hardning a little)}
<D>__{nothing if she dosen't love me }
<A>__{leland has risen. he speaks as he turns away, starting towards the door.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you want love on your own terms, don't you, charlie }
<P>__{(he stops his}
<D>__{back turned to}
<P>__{kane)}
<D>__{love according to your own rules. and if anything goes wrong and you're hurt then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening and no matter who else is hurt!}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{it's simpler than that, brad. a society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. other things are important to her social position, what they're saying on the front porches at southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner }
<A>__{leland has turned, taking his eye again. now kane stops and smiles.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{she can leave me. as a matter of fact, i've already left her. don't worry, brad i will live.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i know you will.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(with all his charm)}
<D>__{hey, brad! i've been analyzed an awful lot tonight let's have another brandy.}
<A>__{leland shakes his head. kane lifts his glass.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{to love on my terms. those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own.}
