<L>__{13. i n t . l e o ' s d a y}
<A>__{a working class bar, an alcoholic or two, pinball machines. schuyler sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not his kind of place. a waitress arrives in a too small uniform young, multiple earrings, christine according to her name tag.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{can i take your order?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i haven't seen the menu.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, right. here, see ya.}
<A>__{she hands him a menu and starts off. schuyler calls after her.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{an iced tea, please }
<A>__{she waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back. schuyler sighs and opens the menu. suddenly, someone backhands the side of his skull, he assumes a defensive posture. schuyler sees his laughing brother: david van orton.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yo, sky. happy birthday.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(rubs his head, annoyed)}
<D>__{thanks, "pee pee." i never get tired of that.}
<A>__{david slides into the seat opposite him. he's in his early 30's, good looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring and a perpetual grin. there's an intense, edgy quality to him which schuyler has some trouble readjusting to.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{well... long time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah, since mom died what, five years? so how you been?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{business as usual...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how's elizabeth? any kids?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{a little girl.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{congrat }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{it's not mine, she married a pediatrician in sausalito.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you're divorced...}
<P>__{(off schuyler's nod)}
<D>__{too bad, she was actually interesting.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{she stopped drinking, i guess getting rid of me was the 13th step.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so you're all alone in the house of pain.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i redecorated. where have you been?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all over. nowhere in particular. didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i called them off two years ago, david. you'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in central america...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's gorgeous down there... you should go sometime.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need? you can't have gone through the trust fund...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(looks at him, hurt)}
<D>__{that's not why i'm here, sky, i just wanted to see you... i even brought a gift, for a change.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you didn't bake me a cake, did you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you can't still be mad about the hash brownies...}
<A>__{schuyler's unamused by the memory. david grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{happy birthday, bro.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what is this.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's a bomb. open it!}
<A>__{schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out a business card in blue and orange: "consumer recreation services." the c, r and s are highlighted, a phone number at the bottom. schuyler picks up the card, fingers it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{consumer recreation services. ok...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise. just promise me you'll give 'em a call.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just call 'em. ok look, it's simple, really. they entertain you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{is this an escort service?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, it's nothing like that. they're a business, they're for real... they guarantee just one thing you won't be bored.}
<A>__{schuyler gives him a bored, blank look. david throws up his hands.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they make your life fun.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{fun.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you've heard of it.}
<A>__{christine the waitress has shown up with schuyler's iced tea. she puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table. schuyler shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap. cracking gum:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she moves off as schuyler tries to order, raising a finger }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{old connection used to meet me here. so you gonna call 'em?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(a sigh, carefully)}
<D>__{you know, david, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, i'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation }
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(mimicking him bitterly)}
<D>__{"a delicate liquidation," god, you would do this...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{david }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we can't get together once without you making me feel like shit. that's important to you, isn't it?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{forget about it, don't bother.}
<A>__{david slumps in his seat, won't meet schuyler's eyes.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{are you still on medication...?}
<A>__{david glares at him. with the impeccable timing of all waitresses, christine appears, chipper.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{you guys know what you want?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{she curls her lip and departs before schuyler can open his mouth. he sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating. calmly:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just thought you'd like it. i did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me. and for your information, i'm not on anything anymore, i'm not even seeing a shrink, i'm in a better place than i've ever been, i'm even happy but that's something else i wouldn't be able to explain to you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{ok, ok, i will give them a call...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{look, take a pill. just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is. i hate surprises.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{david winks, puts a finger to his lips not another word. close as schuyler slips the brightly colored card into his pocket.}
