<L>__{int nite: hall (winter 1945)}
<A>__{the hallway of the main house is filled with men michael doesn't recognize. they pay little attention to him. most of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.}
<L>__{int nite: don's living room (winter 1945)}
<A>__{michael moves into the living room; there is a christmas tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls. theresa hagen is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey. on the other side of the sofa sits clemenza; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva. paulie gatto sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room. clemenza sees michael, looks up at him.}

<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you heard from tom yet?}
<A>__{without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. occasionally, strange men will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(taking her hand)}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<A>__{he leads her into his father's office without knocking.}
