<L>__{interior mmcr. day}
<A>__{the ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big screen. some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. the nigerian ambassador turns to beck, whispering curiously.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{that man over there. he's in charge?}
<B>__{beck follows his glance to mcconnell}
<A>__{who is surrounded by a knot of technicians, to whom he is giving quiet, precise instructions. they hover, then depart, like so many eager bees.}
<B>__{beck}
<A>__{smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{no, actually, that's jim mcconnell, the capcom. our voice link to the astronauts? jim's been with the manned mars program since its inception. one of our real pioneers.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{will he be going to mars, too?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{ah, no. this is as close as he gets.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing away their dishes and leftovers.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...anyway, that's about it. we'll send another packet when we get back.}
<A>__{cote clears her throat, gives luke a look. the others can barely conceal their grins.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, right. one more thing. today is a very special day for a good friend of ours, and i know he's there right now.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at the screen, worried. what's luke up to?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{now, he hates it when any fuss is made, so i won't mention his name...}
<A>__{a look of relief comes over mcconnell.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...because the last thing in the world i'd ever want to do is embarrass someone like jim mcconnell.}
<A>__{mcconnell winces dear god, no as, on the screen, kirov appears from off camera holding a cupcake with a burning candle stuck in it, and the mars one crew starts singing "happy birthday" to him. loudly. and very off key.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{c'mon, you micker weasels, sing!}
<A>__{soon most everyone in mmcr is singing along even some of the jolly ambassadors with the noticeable exception of beck, who stiffens unhappily. mcconnell is mortified.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(sings a line, then, to camera:)}
<D>__{hey, ray! take a look at him! is he all red with one of those fake "i'm a good sport" grins?}
<A>__{beck looks over at mcconnell, who indeed is red in the face with a fake "i'm a good sport" grin.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and hey, you guys, check out ray! does he have on one of his "this wasn't in my mission plan" faces?}
<A>__{indeed, beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{nothing you can do about it, ray! we're a hundred million miles away!}
<A>__{luke and the crew finish singing the song. luke raises the cupcake in a toast.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{happy birthday, jimbo! make a wish!}
<A>__{he and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. they laugh and applaud, then wave goodbye.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{catch you again soon. take care, buddy. end of transmission.}
<A>__{luke reaches out, turns off the camera, and the display screen}
<B>__{goes black.}
<A>__{beck turns, his gaze locking with mcconnell's. he's annoyed, as if this violation of protocol were somehow mcconnell's fault. mcconnell returns his stare coolly.}
