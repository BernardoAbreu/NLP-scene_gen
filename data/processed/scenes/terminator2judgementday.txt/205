<L>__{exterior service station night}
<A>__{a rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around. they pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office. a sign in the window says closed sundays. they continue around the building to the garage's back door. at the garage door. terminator breaks the lock on the roll up door and raises it. sarah pulls the security car in out of sight. terminator rolls the door down behind them.}
