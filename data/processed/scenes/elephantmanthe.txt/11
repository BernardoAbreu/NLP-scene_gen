<A>__{merrick sitting on his bed, hunched over in concentration reading an illustrated london news. he is staring at a picture of the eddystone lighthouse.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(reading softly)}
<D>__{"a silent shaft of stone on a deserted promontory, the lonely eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to mariners of all nations."}
<A>__{he looks at the picture silently. there is a knock at the door. merrick says, "come in". treves enters, holding a book.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good evening. how are you feeling?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{good evening. very well, thank you. and you?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{very well, thank you. i have something for you, john. i'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.}
<A>__{he holds the book out to him. it's an "alice in wonderland".}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{thank you... so much... oh it's beautiful!}
<A>__{he lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at treves with speechless gratitude. merrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece, the picture of alice grown too large for a hallway, looking imploringly at the dwarfed white rabbit. the caption reads "...curiouser and curiouser". he leafs through the pages looking at the other illustrations as treves, delighted with the gift's effect, looks on.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i came to tell you that i will be here early tomorrow morning. we're moving you to your permanent home. i'm sure you'll be very happy there, john. so get a good night's rest, there'll be new people to meet tomorrow. good night.}
<A>__{treves smiles broadly and exits.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{treves' words have disturbed merrick. he sinks into the pillows, the book before him. we see the picture of the mock turtle perched upon his rock, great tears rolling down his cow like face, as alice and the gryphon look on with intense sympathy. merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the wall. the peacock pub whitechapel the night porter enters and saunters over to the noisy crowd. as they welcome him, he slaps down the times on the bar counter for all to see.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{here... listen to this. this is a letter to the london times from the guvnor of the hospital.}
<P>__{(starts to read)}
<D>__{there is now in a little room off one of our attic wards a man named john merrick, so dreadful a sight that he is unable even to come out by daylight to the garden. he has been called the elephant man on account of his terrible deformity...}
<A>__{the night porter has the undivided attention of the people in the pub.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{...his appearance is so terrible that woman and nervous persons fly in terror at the sight of him.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{...and guess who can get you tickets to see him? your own sunny jim!}
<C>__{young man in crowd}
<D>__{let's go see him, then!}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{keep your shirts on.}
<P>__{(shaking his finger at them)}
<D>__{...when the time is right. right now he's in the attic but tomorrow they're movin' him into bedstead square, right into my lap... then... for the right price you'll see something you'll never see again in your life.}
<A>__{he lifts his glass to his lips. we move back to see bytes' boys who, having heard the night porter's words, slips unnoticed from the pub.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(wheezing)}
<D>__{workhouse!}
<A>__{hallway moving day merrick, in his disguise, and treves, one arm around him, are walking together. merrick seems very uneasy. a nurse, on duty early or late getting off, passes them. she stares at the hooded figure. they continue on in silence.}
<B>__{bedstead square room}
<A>__{the room is now spotless. it is furnished with a bed and the required pillows, a small table and chair by the window, now curtained. adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains a bathtub. merrick enters and looks around, confused. treves stands in the doorway. merrick turns to him.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{this is your new home, john.}
<A>__{merrick pulls off his hood. his eyes are bewildered.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{this... is my new home?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{the hospital?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{of course! what did you think?}
<A>__{merrick's eyes glisten with held back tears. he lowers them.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(almost sobbing)}
<D>__{how long will i stay here?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i promise you. you will never see the inside of that horrible place again. you will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. it's a splendid room, don't you think?}
<A>__{merrick inspects his new home. he seems pleased by the bathtub, by the table, by the window to the outside world. merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window. he looks out and then up with a small intake of breath. before him, beyond the hospital fence, the spire of st. phillips cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{when i'm next moved may i go to a lighthouse?... or to a blind asylum?}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{we see carr gomm walking to his office. he is met at the door by an anxious treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{has the response picked up?}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{frankly, treves, it's not what i'd expected. a few small cheques. well wishers. don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{but he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. i've promised him that won't happen.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{well... i will let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{please do.}
<A>__{carr gomm goes back into his office and treves walks off. merrick's room (a while later) there is no one in the room. the bathroom door opens and nora and another nurse enter, carrying buckets which they set down by the hall door. they straighten up and lean back against it. mrs. mothershead enters from the bathroom, speaking over her shoulder to merrick.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{well, i think i can safely hand the duties over to you girls now. mr. merrick will require a bath every day... that way he won't pong quite so much. nora, you can instruct kathleen on the finer points of mr. merrick's bath. you'll be on your own tomorrow.}
<A>__{the girls try to keep bright faces.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{don't look so glum girls. such enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful.}
<A>__{mothershead starts to exit.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{oh, and girls, under no circumstances are there to be any mirrors brought into this room.}
<A>__{she exits.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{he's... so ugly!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{ugly or not, you're going to help me.}
<A>__{merrick quietly enters the room, dressed in a billowy white shirt and baggy black pants. the two nurses try to smile, but he cannot look at them.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{feeling better now, mr. merrick?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{kathleen's eyes go wide at the sound.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you look very nice in your new clothes.}
<A>__{merrick looks down at himself.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{well, if there is nothing more, i suppose we'll be leaving you now.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{no, nothing.}
<A>__{the girls leave, taking the buckets. merrick, alone, walks about the room getting the feel of his new clothes. there is a knock at the door and treves enters.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you look splendid, john.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{when one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.}
