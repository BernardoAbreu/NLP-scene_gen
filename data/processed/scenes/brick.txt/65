<L>__{interior backstage of theater continuous}
<A>__{he spins to see kara's face just before the door closes. she's worried.}
<L>__{exterior crowded school hallway day}
<A>__{the brain walks out of a classroom and brendan swings behind him.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(fast and low)}
<D>__{tail kara through lunch. she's got rehearsal but she'll blow early. she goes home, drop her, else wait for my call.}
<A>__{the brain turns and brendan's gone.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot lunch}
<A>__{brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot. brad bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible, front door open. a small crowd hangs about brad, his crony biff at his elbow.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{that's all i'm saying, is put me in the game and i will do what needs to be done, but they don't put me in, what needs doing don't get done and don't come crying to me, man. get off my grill man, you didn't put me in, don't come to me if you didn't let me play.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{they didn't!}
<A>__{brendan scans the rest of the cars. his eyes catch on laura dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. her bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into brendan. he wags his eyebrows at her. she looks away. brendan walks into brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey! what are you doing here?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{listening.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright, you got me. i'm a scout for the gophers.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{of all things, yeah. been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. you've got heart, kid. how soon can you move to minneapolis?}
<A>__{a few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near brad.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(flat with anger)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{there's a thesaurus in the library. 'yeah's under 'y'. go ahead, i will wait.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{who invited you?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{to the parking lot? well gee i kind of invited myself.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i think you'd better leave then.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, i'm having too good a time.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{just the same.}
<A>__{brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his legs. brad's face tenses.}
<C>__{brad }
<D>__{maybe you want to go someplace more private.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{with you?}
<A>__{brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.}
<C>__{brendan }
<P>__{(as if he's been asked to the movies)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{brendan stands and walks off. brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him. he leads them behind a parked vw van and turns to face brad. people gather around in a wide circle. brendan pulls his jacket off as brad hangs back, mumbling.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{you know what's good for you you'll just beat it. beating a small frye won't win me anything and it's not going to do you any good }
<A>__{laura pulls up in her convertible, behind brad, watching. in the next moment brendan cuts brad off by putting his fist in his face. brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. brendan throws his short stocky frame into brad's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs. brad tags brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement. he comes at brendan with his big fists clenched. brendan kicks brad full force in the shins. brad tumbles, and brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of brad's chin. brad gets his balance fast, and before brendan can throw another he throws one himself, then another, both into brendan's stomach. brendan pulls back and kicks brad's shin where he had kicked it before. brad roars and hits brendan very hard in the face. brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into brad's nose. the sound of eggs breaking, and brad falls backwards like a board. he stays down, holding his face. brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd. some stare at brendan, some at brad, but nobody seems about to do anything. brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over.}
<C>__{straggler}
<D>__{hey, is there a fight?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he throws a last look at laura, who meets his gaze and drives off.}
