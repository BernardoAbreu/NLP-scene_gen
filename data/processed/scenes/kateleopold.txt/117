<L>__{interior bedroom the next morning}
<A>__{sunlight floods the room. clothes are scattered about. two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. one of the figures rolls around. the covers are pulled back revealing:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{patrice}
<D>__{morning.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior living room morning}
<A>__{leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. the table is set for a huge breakfast. kate also in a robe enters from the hallway. there is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{they kiss shyly. kate notices the feast.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{look what you've done!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{nothing? my own mother never made me a breakfast like this.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i will have to have a talk with her.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{kate...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{about last night...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{please sit down.}
<A>__{he pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{kate, i had never before been a considerate man. i had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting for some incentive to force me into action. you have made me see how rare our time here really is. i am most beholden to you kate. and always will be.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i sense the word "but" entering into this any minute now.}
<A>__{leopold takes her hands in his. she looks at him defensively, bracing for worst.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{do me the honor katherine, of becoming my wife.}
<A>__{kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{shall i take that as a "yes"?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold! did you just ask me to marry you?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i love you, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's entirely beside the pointerior.. you're moving way too fast here. shouldn't we date first? i mean it's obvious the first one went well...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{where i come from that's pretty much the way it works.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold, even though last night we... loved each other, that doesn't mean this morning we're engaged. it just doesn't work that way now.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(taking a ring off}
<D>__{his fingers and}
<P>__{placing it on hers)}
<D>__{i have loved you since i first set eyes on you. i cannot imagine my life without you beside me. i want to marry you, kate and make an honest woman of you.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh leopold, sit down.}
<A>__{they switch places. leopold sits and kate kneels beside him.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{relationships these days are much more complicated than that. women today have certain freedoms that men have been taking advantage of for centuries. you must have been aware of that. if you think about it clearly, it should be obvious to you that marriage between us is out of the question.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{do you not love me kate?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(almost inaudible)}
<D>__{don't ever think that...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{then consider my proposal.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i will think it over but i can tell you now the answer is...}
<A>__{he kisses her. it's impressive.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{possibly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(a knowing smile)}
<D>__{i need you beside me. i will not give up easily.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{do what you have to do...}
<A>__{charlie enters. kate and leopold become extremely selfconscious.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{leopold and kate}
<P>__{(too casual and too chipper)}
<D>__{morning!}
<A>__{charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite right. he studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the table. kate and leopold serve themselves breakfast.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{coffee?}
<A>__{kate nods. as leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i would like some coffee.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{of course. say when.}
<A>__{she pours charlie's coffee until it overflows.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{when.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{as kate wipes up the table, charlie notices her ring. he eyes leopold suspiciously. leopold concentrates on his plate. charlie gives kate a questioning glance. she smiles at him, looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. after a beat:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{all smile privately and sip their coffee without another word.}
