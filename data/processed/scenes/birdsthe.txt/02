<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{hello, mrs. macgruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{hello, miss daniels.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what do you suppose it is?}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{mrs. macgruder takes a look out at the sky. a puppy is barking, o.s.}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{there must be a storm at sea. that can drive them inland, you know.}
<A>__{they are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. the barking of the dog segues into the clamor of innumerable birds, tweeting, twittering, cawing as melanie and mrs. macgruder go to the counter at the far end. there is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. the birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. as they walk:}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{i was hoping you'd be a little late, miss daniels.}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{you see, he hasn't arrived yet.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you said three o'clock.}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{i know. oh, i know.}
<P>__{(she is more distressed now)}
<D>__{i've been calling all morning. oh, you have no idea. miss daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. we get them from india, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well, this one won't be a chick, will he?}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{certainly not. oh, no. certainly not. this will be a full grown myna bird. full grown.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and he'll talk?}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{well, yes, he'll talk. well, no, no. you'll have to teach him to talk.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{oh my, i suppose i should call them again. they said three o'clock.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe it's the traffic. i will call. would you mind waiting?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(judiciously)}
<D>__{i think maybe you'd better deliver him. let me give you my address.}
<P>__{(she begins taking off her gloves)}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<P>__{(producing pencil and pad)}
<D>__{oh. oh, well, all right.}
<A>__{as melanie starts writing:}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{i'm sure they're on the way, though. could i just call?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(with a resigned sigh)}
<D>__{well, all right, but...}
<A>__{she scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. she taps her teeth with the pencil.}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder }
<D>__{hello, this is betty macgruder at davidson's.}
<P>__{(pause; accusingly)}
<D>__{it's past three, you know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, how long do you think...? all right, would you check it please? yes, i will wait.}
<A>__{melanie sighs. leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. there is no menace in the birds surrounding her. they are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. off screen, the puppy begins barking again as the front door opens. melanie looks up. med. shot mitch brenner as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. he is a handsome man, about twenty nine or thirty, well dressed, and carrying a felt hat. close shot melanie seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. she pokes the pencil through the mesh. the birds are startled into scarlet flight. two shot melanie and mitch as they pass each other in the aisle. he gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. but as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. med. shot melanie looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with mitch again.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i wonder if you could help me.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(deliberately, and}
<D>__{with a touch of}
<P>__{hauteur)}
<D>__{i said i wonder if you could help me.}
<A>__{close shot melanie a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. she is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. but then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?}
<A>__{two shot melanie and mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{lovebirds.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{lovebirds, sir?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{yes. i understand there are different varieties, it that true?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well... yes, sir, there are.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{these are for my sister... her birthday you see. as she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, i wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i understand completely, sir.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{as the same time, i wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(leading him around shop)}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{do you have a pair that are just friendly?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i think so, sir.}
<P>__{(she looks around)}
<D>__{now then, let me see.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(at the finches)}
<D>__{aren't these lovebirds?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no, sir, those are... redbirds.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{the sign says strawberry finches.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(airily)}
<D>__{yes, we call them that too.}
<P>__{(she moves away)}
<D>__{ahhh, here we are, lovebirds...}
<P>__{(and stops before a cage of canaries)}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{those are canaries, miss.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{doesn't this make you feel awful?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{doesn't what make me...?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{all these innocent little creatures caged up like this?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i suppose not. is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{oh, certainly. it's to protect the species.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i imagine that's very important. especially during the moulting season.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{are they moulting now?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{some of them are.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.}
<A>__{close shot a caged bird mitch's p.o.v. the bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{yes, i see.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{about those lovebirds, miss...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? we have some very nice canaries this week.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{she smiles back.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(he waits)}
<D>__{all right, may i see one, please?}
<A>__{close shot melanie as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. she smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects mrs. macgruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. she opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(feebly)}
<D>__{here, birdie. here, birdie, birdie.}
<A>__{one of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. melanie leaps back, startled.}

<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{what is it? oh! oh my, one of the birds is loose!}
<A>__{she joins in the chase around the room. the bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{shhh! shhhh!}
<A>__{he tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it. close shot mitch the canary in his hand.}

<A>__{close shot melanie startled.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{two shot melanie and mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(savoring this)}
<D>__{i was merely drawing a parallel, miss daniels.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{but how... how do you know my name?}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(secretly)}
<D>__{a little birdie told me.}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i didn't break that window!}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{no, but your little prank did. the judge should have put you behind bars!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what are you? a policeman?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i simply believe in the law, miss daniels, and i'm not too keen on practical jokers.}
