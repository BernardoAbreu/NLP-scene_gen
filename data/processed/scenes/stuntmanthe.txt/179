<L>__{interior screening room}
<A>__{jake is there with several other men. but before cameron can even register who they are, eli is saying...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry, gentlemen, but i've got exactly two minutes of borrowed time. i'm in the middle of a scene.}
<P>__{(to projectionist)}
<D>__{get it started.}
<A>__{immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the screen. in the dark, the men in the room fumble their way to seats. on the projection screen we see a helicopter shot of the duesenberg approaching the bridge. cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. his eyes dart around at the official looking faces staring at the o.s. film. one face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(addressing a man next to him)}
<D>__{this fellow here is the stunt man driving that car.}
<P>__{(to cameron)}
<D>__{thompson is from the fbi. they wanted you here in case they have any questions.}
<A>__{on the projection screen, we see the duesenberg go off the edge of the bridge, disappear in the water.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i don't see anybody else on the road...did you, burt?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the man cameron couldn't recognize speaks out.}
<C>__{other man}
<D>__{my buddy and i saw that son of a bitch break out of the woods and head that way, down the road.}
<A>__{the lights go on and cameron looks at the speaker, recognizing him as one of the telephone linemen. apparently, the lineman doesn't recognize cameron in his new identity.}
<C>__{lineman}
<D>__{...i had a clear view. i was on top of the pole.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{do you mind if we see that again?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{help yourself, the room is yours. but i've got thirty people on the set being paid for doing nothing.}
<P>__{(moving toward the door and calling)}
<D>__{come on burt, you've got some reading to do.}
<A>__{cameron follows eli as the lights go out and the film begins again.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey burt, glad you're still alive, considering who you're working for.}
