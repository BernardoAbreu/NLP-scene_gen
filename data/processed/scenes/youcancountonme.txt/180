<D>__{i'm just kidding. i just thought... just thought i'd check up on her...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{anyway, after that, i don't really know. i've been thinking about alaska a lot. i still got some friends out there. i don't really know. anyway, i will write you.}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what is gonna happen to you?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{nothing too bad... but i gotta tell you, i know things didn't work out too well this time...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well, terry }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{...but it's always really good to know that wherever i am, whatever stupid shit i'm doing, you're back at my home, rooting for me.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i do root for you.}
<A>__{she starts crying, and looks down.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{come on, sammy. everything's gonna be all right... comparatively... and i will be back this way...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i feel like i'm never gonna see you again...!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{of course you will, sammy. you never have to worry about that.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{please don't go till you know where you're going. please...!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i do know where i'm going. i'm going to worcester and i'm gonna try to see that girl. and then depending on what happens there, i thought i'd try to see if there's any work for me out west. and if there is, i'm gonna head out there for the summer and try to make some money. and if there isn't, i will figure something else out. maybe i will stay around the east. i don't know... i really liked it in alaska. it was really beautiful. you just it made me feel good. and before things got so messed up i was doin' pretty well out there. seriously. but i couldn't stay here long, sammy: i don't want to live here. but i'm gonna stay in touch. and i will be back. 'cause i want to see you and i want to see rudy. i will come home for christmas. how about that? we'll have christmas together.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{come on, sammy. you can trust me...}
<A>__{still looking down, sammy shakes her head, tears leaking down her cheeks.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{come on, sammy... look at me... look at me...}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hey, sammy... remember when we were kids, remember what we always used to say to each other . . .?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{remember when we were kids?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{of course i do...!}
<A>__{she throws her arms around his neck. he pats her gently.}
