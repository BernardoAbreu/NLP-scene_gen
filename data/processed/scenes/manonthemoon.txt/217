<L>__{interior carnegie hall later that night}
<A>__{the corny "jingle jangle cowboy" movie is playing on a big screen. it finishes. beaming andy grabs the mike.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen! i'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, eleanor "cody" gould!!}
<A>__{crazed applause. frail eleanor gould, 75, comes onstage.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{it's such an honor to have you here.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<P>__{(squinting into the lights)}
<D>__{andy... this is so overwhelming...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, it's gettin' even better! 'cause we found one of the original hobby horses! do you do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "jingle jangle jingle"?}
<A>__{eleanor starts to protest but andy hands her the hobby horse. she blushes. andy turns away, goes to the band, and starts conducting. they begin to play "jingle jangle jingle." eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles. andy gets excited and conducts faster. eleanor is sweating. she dances faster. andy impatiently speeds up the music more. eleanor desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up... when suddenly she grabs her heart. eleanor stops and collapses. she's down. a horrified gasp from the crowd. the band stops playing. crew members run on from backstage. one checks her heart. she's not moving. zmuda runs out, horrified.}

<D>__{is there a doctor in the house??!}
<A>__{the crowd is stunned silent. pause then one man stands. it's michael. straight faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the aisle, and goes on stage. michael checks her pulse and loosens her blouse. he presses eleanor's chest, trying to restart her heart. but then he shakes his head sadly. she's dead. the crowd moans sadly. michael covers eleanor with a jacket.}
