<A>__{tsu'tey leads three direhorse riders up the trail two teenage hunters and jake, who's riding well enough to keep up. the horses' hooves clop right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. it's the test every young hunter has to pass.}
<A>__{tsu'tey signals a stop. up slope ahead is an astounding formation. thick vine like trees have trapped large floating boulders of unobtanium in their gnarled grip. a hundred meters above them more boulders are woven into the twisted vine trunks. this is some sort of freak natural occurrence like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds. there is a thundering roar, like an artillery barrage, and the ground shakes. jake looks around at one of the floating mountains grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa. a huge rockfall is set loose. the mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky. the hunters dismount. jake looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. he turns to tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we doin' this?}
<A>__{jake leaps to catch up as tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk.}
