<L>__{exterior roof night}
<A>__{odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only source of light as hector moves across the flat roof. in one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. he moves towards it. the figure speaks.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i missed you last night.}
<A>__{it is thalia. we can tell that they are close. hector sits down beside her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{he kept me working until morning.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{he has no money and a lot of enemies. if he's very clever he'll survive... but the omens are bad... and he's not very clever.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{she doesn't like him.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{nobody does. he's unfortunate. you get people like that. clumsy and sad.}
<A>__{thalia looks out towards the sea.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean?}
<A>__{hector puts an arm around thalia. at first it feels strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter of fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and the realness of their friendship. their stroking and touching and holding becomes good to watch. we get a feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place where they can be themselves.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's the gods arguing. they're working out what to do with lucinnius... he'll be lying awake down there... wondering what they're saying about him.}
<A>__{they laugh. far away some street dogs bark.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{if he goes down i will ask for my freedom... he owes it to me... he said as much... you too... we could be free...}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what we talk about.}
<A>__{by now he is kissing her.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{we talk about going home. yours is that way and mine is that way... your family is that way.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i just made that up... i don't know which way they are... anyway ... you can't think like that. not after so many years...}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{it's what you talk about.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we talk about it because it can never happen. what we do is you and me...}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{i don't understand. i think you'll leave. you're going to leave me here.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{never. it's you and me now. that's all.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{well. we stay here. he'll survive.}
<A>__{hector is silent, still kissing her. he yawns as he speaks.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{then i can see you every night. i'm tired.}
