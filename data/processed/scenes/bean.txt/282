<D>__{ladies and gentlemen most of you have seen whistler's mother before, can i ask you just to step back. thank you.}
<A>__{it's part of his plan of caution he knows there's something wrong and wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. the crowd moves back.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'd like the governor to have, as it were, a private audience with his new friend.}

<D>__{ah, hello, sorry, i ... ahm... sorry ...}
<A>__{bean turns. in fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone getting too close to the great painting. he spins and falls in the direction of the painting.}
