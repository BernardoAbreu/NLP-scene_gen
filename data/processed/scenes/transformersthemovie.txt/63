<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the decepticon flat top and cyclonus' armada}
<B>__{on galvatron}
<A>__{as he works controls which eject more moleculon missiles. his p.o.v. ultra magnus' shuttle electrical outline envelopes it and there is a... ... blinding flash after which... .. remnants of the hull and superstructure explode toward camera and past camera accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence! ... where the shuttle had been there is now...nothing! just loose asteroids and clouds of space dust}
<C>__{cyclonus}
<D>__{the autobots have been terminated!}
<C>__{galvatron}
<D>__{excellent. and soon we shall say the same of that infernal unicron. suddenly, galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in pain.}
<C>__{galvatron }
<D>__{aaaah! take me to unicron...aaaah!}
<B>__{long shot on the huge flat top}
<A>__{as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by cyclonus' armada. hold for a beat, and then close in on the dust cloud as... ... part of ultra magnus' shuttle flies into the clear.}
<B>__{angle on the cockpit}
<A>__{arcee, perceptor, springer, blurr are crowded together in cramped remnant of cockpit as daniel and ultra magnus sit at the control deck}
<C>__{arcee}
<D>__{did we have to detonate three quarters of the ship?!}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{seeing how they would have detonated four quarters, i think it was a good choice. sudden shudder and the ship drops sharply, all holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{perceptor....can you still locate the junk planet?}
<C>__{perceptor}
<D>__{gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities, however.....}
<P>__{(looks at ultra magnus)}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{holds his head in his hands as springer grimaces}
<B>__{resume on perceptor}
<A>__{realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat}
<C>__{perceptor}
<D>__{ahem.....yes i think i can.}
<A>__{long shot shuttle changing course toward large distant}
<B>__{planet}
