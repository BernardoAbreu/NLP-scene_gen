<L>__{interior wyatt club squash courts day}
<A>__{games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds. crossing to gekko and bud going at it. bud is obviously the worse for wear.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{...come on sport, you gotta try harder, i need some exercise for chrissake...}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{mr. gekko, i don't think i can...go on.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{...finish out the game, bud, push yourself...}
<A>__{meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. gekko hits the ball, a big fat shot. bud returns, gekka moves him around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but the ball's never quite out of reach till bud finally can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes into the wall and collapses. gekko laughs. bud lying there like a sad dog as gekka hauls him up.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{the public is out there throwing darts at a board, sport. i don't throw darts at a board. i only bet sure things. read sun tzu's "the art of war." 'every battle is won before it is ever fought.' think about it.}
<A>__{he exits the squash court.}
