<L>__{exterior hill outside ashton day}
<A>__{edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave. outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked clean. in his most serious voice, edward calls out:}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{hello!}
<A>__{there's no answer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my name is edward bloom! i want to talk to you!}
<A>__{from deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{go away!}
<A>__{the giant's voice has such force, it blows edward's hair back.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere until you show yourself.}
<A>__{a beat, then we hear a rumble, like a train coming. edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's going to take. as the rumble gets louder, the ground starts to shake. even edward starts to worry. just how big is this guy?}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, i knew the giant couldn't kill me. all the same, i preferred to keep my bones unbroken.}
<A>__{edward picks up a stone, ready to play david to goliath. then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. hunched over, he slams into a stunned edward, knocking him halfway down the hill. karl the giant is bigger than any man you've ever seen. not just tall, but massive. he's completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. what remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy. god knows what's living in his matted hair. karl leans over edward, blocking the sun. edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off. the giant didn't even notice it.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<A>__{edward ponders the best response, settling on...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{so you can eat me. the town decided to send a human sacrifice, and i volunteered.}
<A>__{karl's eyes narrow, confused. edward stands up.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my arms are a little stringy, but there's some good eating on my legs. i mean, i'd be tempted to eat them myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so i guess, just, if you could get it over with quick. because i'm not much for pain, really.}
<A>__{edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. karl just stares at him, not sure what to do. after a beat, edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing. relieved to see he's not licking his chops }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{look, i can't go back. i'm a human sacrifice. if i go back, everyone will think i'm a coward. and i'd rather be dinner than a coward.}
<A>__{karl sits down with a boom, dejected.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{here, start with my hand. it'll be an appetizer.}
<A>__{reaching up, edward shoves his hand into karl's mouth. but the giant spits it back out.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i don't want to eat you. i don't want to eat anybody. it's just i get so hungry. i'm too big.}
<A>__{and that's the sad truth. karl is less a monster than a freak a giant man, but in the end, just a man. edward takes a seat beside him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{did you ever think maybe you're not too big? maybe this town's just too small. i mean, look at it.}
<A>__{circling behind them, we look down at ashton a tiny town in a tiny valley.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{hardly two stories in the whole place. now i've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{wouldn't lie to you. and they've got all you can eat buffets. you can eat a lot, can't you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i can.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{so why are you wasting your time in a small town? you're a big man. you should be in the big city.}
<A>__{karl smiles, but then it fades. a certain sad suspicion }
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{you're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? that's why they sent you here.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what's your name, giant?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{karl.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{mine's edward. and truthfully, i do want you to leave, karl. but i want to leave with you.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{you think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. i can't see staying here a day longer.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{you don't like it?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i love every square inch of it. but i can feel the edges closing in on me. a man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so what do you say? join me?}
<A>__{karl thinks a moment. then }
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they shake on it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{now first, we gotta get you ready for the city.}
