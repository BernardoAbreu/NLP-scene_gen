<A>__{flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of domestics. deborah jogs into view.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{hi, flor..see you up there.}
<A>__{deborah runs past..she is clearly upset..she is also more than a stay in shape jogger. she is an athletic woman fueled by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. this makes her seriously quick. she is highly aware of passing everybody..she needs to pass everybody..her voice trails behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left, please," "left," "left."}
