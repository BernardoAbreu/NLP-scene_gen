<A>__{harry slips inside. he sets down his suitcase and walks quietly down the hall. he pauses at a door with lurid labels and stickers plastered all over it (toxic waste, stay out!, if it's too loud you're too old, etc.) harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping daughter, dana. she looks like an angel in the moonlight coming in the window. in fact, she is a typical 14 year old girl, and therefore hardly an angel. but to harry she is unflawed.}
