<L>__{interior exterior lobby evening}
<A>__{a notice behind the locked front door informs: "all visitors must be announced". mike displays his shield to the doorman through the glass. the doorman opens, taking the time to inspect his credentials before returning them, then steps aside, allowing entry.}
<L>__{interior elevator same}
<A>__{mike rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.}
<L>__{interior vestibule claire's apartment same}
<A>__{the elevator delivers him. mike finds himself in a wall papered trompe l'oeil foyer. nothing to get his bearings. the front door clicks open, startling him. mary, the cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional civilian clothes, greets him matter of factly, taking him in.}
<L>__{interior claire's living room same}
<A>__{marble floored and high ceilinged, absolutely palatial; mike's eyes registering amazement as he's led inward. floor to ceiling windows overlooking central park, where the voices are revealed belonging to garber, t.j., claire, and claire's boyfriend, neil who's trying his best to be "in charge".}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(approaching mike)}
<D>__{you remember detective keegan?}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(expressionless)}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings again: mary goes to answer it as mike mumbles his greetings to all noticing that claire, reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out or is it "disinterested"?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i want to make sure that everyone respects the privacy of miss gregory's household. you're limited to the outer vestibule, so you can watch the elevator, the kitchen, so you can get something to eat, and the washroom.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<P>__{(under his breath to mike)}
<D>__{so you can take a shit.}
<A>__{the third detective enters, being led by mary. it's koontz, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you definitely don't take home to mother.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(reacting; to t.j.)}
<D>__{not koontz.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{be happy. he's good at this.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(to neil)}
<D>__{we'd like to, just once, get a look at the entire layout, so we can evaluate security.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{this really isn't necessary. the security in this building is about the best in the city.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(ever the diplomat)}
<D>__{i'm sure you're right, miss gregory, but i'd consider it a favor if you'd let us look around.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(to his troops)}
<D>__{guys.}
<A>__{angle hallway as garber withdraws; mike, t.j., koontz to start their check.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to garber)}
<D>__{what about when she goes out?}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{discourage it. but stay with her if you can't. call it in first so we can have a car on tail. she's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.}
<A>__{they split up. angle mike following orders, continues down the hall. he moves to a door that he attempts to open discovering it's not real. it's a trompe l'oeil. he turns around to find he's not alone in the long hall. neil stands just outside the living room, watching him.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(re: the "door")}
<D>__{pretty good.}
<A>__{angle neil turns, returning to claire in the living room.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{why an i reminded of the three stooges?}
