<L>__{interior hostess club later}
<A>__{ich is sitting at the crowded bar. a hostess has her arm around his neck. he checks out the room, searching for the girl. he notices two thugs standing outside a sliding door. ich finishes his drink.}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{let me up.}
<C>__{hostess}
<P>__{(shoving him down)}
<D>__{sit, sweetie.}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{another seagrams!}
<A>__{ich relents. then, spotting something across the room: what he sees: a rice paper door slides open, momentarily revealing a dozen men with close cropped hair sitting on tatami mats, playing poker. some have their coats off, revealing arms covered with tattoos. yakuza. a hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door partially open. the hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but ich cannot see inside. she slides it shut. ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but ich shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors. ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder; then starts singing along with frank sinatra on the stereo. he's a little too loud, a little off key. the bodyguards eye ich suspiciously. he stumbles past them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.}
<B>__{inside the room}
<A>__{a low table. kobo is at one end. an older, distinguished, sliver haired man in his seventies whom we will come to know as sugai is at the other. ich can't believe his eyes: sugai is the head of the largest yakuza syndicate in japan. a half dozen lieutenants sit on either side of the table. half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other half are younger wearing $700 issy miyake jackets.}
<B>__{sugai and kobo}
<A>__{are having a heated discussion. the girl ich and nick have been following walks over to kobo and sits beside him. this makes sugai even more irate. he's on his feet, red faced and screaming.}
<B>__{four guards}
<A>__{seeing ich, pull out their beretta's. two more grab him and fling him head first against the wall.}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(drunken, in japanese)}
<D>__{i have to piss, gentlemen... i'm so sorry but i have to }
<A>__{the bodyguards hurry him towards the door.}
