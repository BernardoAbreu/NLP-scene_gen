<D>__{1957 was a big year. the russians put that sputnik into outer space, the dodgers played their last game at ebbets field, 'that guy' shot frank costello in the head, and missed, and the gallo brothers whacked albert anastasia in that barber shop in the park sheraton hotel. it was total chaos. with anastasia gone, vito genovese figures he's king shit, but carlo gambino and 'joe bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses. so they call a meeting a big meeting.}

<C>__{mangano}
<D>__{thank you, paul.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{that's why he betrayed dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in miami.}
<A>__{mangano is stunned.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{but i leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. and even though it's my right, i won't take revenge, mostly because i'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me.}
