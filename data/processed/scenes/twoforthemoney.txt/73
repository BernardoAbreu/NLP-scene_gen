<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{walter, toni and brandon relaxing after dinner.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{life is fucking... good. (burp, regarding brandon) let's talk about making it better.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{duck, brandon, here it comes.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i've been tracking you since last year.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{don't let him steamroll you.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{ can i get the damn thing out? i want to put john anthony on tv this week.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{that's me. you mean me.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{that's right. you, john anthony. you're one in the same.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{go on get to the good part, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{hold on. before i say another word, understand you do this thing, brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart john anthony. it's not just a new persona. you can't play it. you gotta live it. that's how this works. the only way it works. you have to sell it all the way.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{think it over, brandon, don't decide now.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it sounds like a promotion.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{bet your ass it is. five star.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{ i'm in.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{well that's a thoughtful response. here i was, worried you'd rush your decision.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's the only move. for six years i've been living on ramen noodles. for the first time in a long time i've got something going. if that means i gotta do a little acting, fine.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{living, not acting. you understand that as of right now brandon lang with his fettucini knee and his self fucking pity is as flat dead as donald trump's hair and john "i can walk on fucking water" anthony has taken his place?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{listen to what he's asking you, brandon.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{she's right. there's no going back. i mean that. this is gonna cost me. i'm talking about building an empire around you. do you understand that?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{... should i wait a little to create some tension? of course i understand, i'm john fucking anthony. i've got the crystal ball...}
