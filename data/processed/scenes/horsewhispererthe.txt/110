<L>__{exterior the double divide another day}
<A>__{pilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming. we discover he is in a pond, tethered to a pole... except for the sound of his legs in the water, everything is quiet and focused on pilgrim. smokey, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, leading pilgrim back and forth as he swims. tom, crouched by the pond, silently concentrating on pilgrim... grace watches, off by herself... annie stands beside joe. she can't help but be intrigued by the sight. she asks joe;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i though horses were afraid of water?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer her. grace likes that. annie, frustrated, feels she has the right to simple shout out to tom.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{is that to get his strength back?}
<A>__{tom pays her no mind concentrating on pilgrim. suddenly, annie's cell phone rings, jarring the proceedings. tom turns to annie. she hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away. tom gives her a look. grace is loving this. tom turns back to pilgrim. after a few moments tom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. he starts to lead pilgrim out of the water. pilgrim, fearful, fights him. he rears, splashing tom, not wanting to come out of the water. grace is worried. she looks to joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly. annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond. tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab pilgrim's rope. pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. joe and smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. annie appears beside grace and watches as tom reaches for the rope again. pilgrim rears again. tom stumbles backwards from his hooves. annie gasps. grace turns to walk away from the pond. she can't watch it brings back too much. but as she does, she is stopped by the sight of tom, righting himself, unphased, calmly walks back to pilgrim. the horse, baffled by this man's lack of fear, lets him take the rope and walk him out of the pond. grace can't help but be impressed. joe nods. annie is shaken.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mr. booker, i'm not at all comfortable with you taking those kinds of chances...}
<A>__{as tom leads pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, knocking tom down...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{pilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him. joe runs over and grabs for the rope.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no... let him go!}
<A>__{joe obeys. pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill out onto a pasture, he keeps on running into the distance running across the pasture, not knowing where he is going... tom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run. a concerned annie approaches.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she's running away! how are you going to get him back?}
<A>__{tom doesn't respond. he walks off down the hill out onto the pasture, stops, arms folded and watches pilgrim. annie turns when she hears smokey, who appears behind her:}
<C>__{smokey}
<D>__{he don't really want to run. don't know where he's going. all this open space scares the daylight out of him.}
<A>__{confused, pilgrim stops running and walks, in no particular direction.}
<C>__{smokey}
<D>__{my guess is he's spent his life in a six by eight stall... he's forgot what it's like to be a horse...}
<A>__{smokey ambles off and she turns back to see tom crouching on his haunches, sitting in the grass, just waiting. pilgrim walks back towards the ranch, stops a distance from tom, looks at him... annie, needing to know exactly what's going on, crosses down the hill to him.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{so what now? should we leave?}
<A>__{tom continues watching pilgrim. annie looks at him, sitting there motionless and feels like an idiot. clearly she doesn't understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the time to explain to her.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, we're going to go then...}
<A>__{without looking at her, tom just nods. annie, awkwardly, walks back up the hill to where grace is... on the grassy hillside, grace is watching the scene by herself as joe appears, staring at her leg... it makes her uncomfortable. she turns to him with a curt, impatient tone;}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{their eyes meet. joe is so guileless, grace is taken off guard when he asks in such a compassionate voice;}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{does that hurt you?}
<A>__{grace tries to think of an answer and of how to say it:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{only when i kick somebody.}
<A>__{her gentle delivery makes him smile. she smiles, then:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't you go to school?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.}
<A>__{he tips his hat down as he looks out to pilgrim with respect;}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{look at him out in the pasture yeah, he must've been a big, beautiful looking horse. how was he to ride?}
<A>__{grace is uncomfortable again. she looks away, just struggling. joe senses she's done talking;}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{excuse me. i got chores to look after.}
<A>__{he tips his hat and walks off, passing annie as she arrives.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you ready to go?}
<A>__{grace hesitates. then mother and daughter take one more look pov pilgrim standing in the pasture with tom crouching in the grass waiting for him.}
