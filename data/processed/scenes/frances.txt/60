<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{frances sits in the cramped room, listening intently to clurman. occasionally she sneaks a glance at odets, who is pacing like some caged beast.}
<C>__{clurman}
<D>__{the group is more than a theatre company. it's the embodiment of an ideal. our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. you see }
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(watching odets)}
<D>__{really, mr. clurman, you don't have to sell me.}
<C>__{clurman}
<D>__{forgive my indulgence. seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. the point is, mr. odets here has written a wonderful play. most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{who is she?}
<C>__{odets}
<D>__{she's a tramp from newark.}
<C>__{clurman}
<D>__{forgive me, but i think you'd be perfect for the part.}
<A>__{odets is pacing furiously, seizing their attention. he stops, looks at her, then resumes.}
<C>__{odets}
<D>__{miss farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault... a seduction... a plea for understanding. i think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets... and you make very attractive ammunition.}
<A>__{he stops. tentatively, almost boyishly, he smiles. she returns it. she's charmed.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{and what's the title of this seduc... assault?}
<C>__{odets}
<P>__{(mysterious, intimate)}
<D>__{'golden boy.'}
