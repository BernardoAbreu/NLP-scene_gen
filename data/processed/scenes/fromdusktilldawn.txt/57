<L>__{exterior titty twister night}
<A>__{the outside of the titty twister is literally covered with hats, clawing, flapping, gnawing, trying like hell to get inside.}
<L>__{interior titty twister night}
<A>__{everybody listens to the bats scratching and clawing all along the walls, the roof and at the front door. everyone's scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to do nexterior the door begins to crack and splinter, little claws poke their way through.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{give me a hand!}
<A>__{jacob runs to a table top. he grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through. the others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door. as the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows, a dead biker that the vampires fed on, pops open his yellow eyes. he sits up and sees all the furious activity. everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. the dead biker vamp sets his sights on kate, who's putting a board into place. he springs to his feet and pounces on her, just as sex machine turns from across the room in her direction.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{watch out, girly!}
<A>__{the biker vamp grabs kate from behind. she lets out a scream. the vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. the others hear the scream and look toward kate. sex machine, big emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue. as the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of kate's shoulder, kate rams her head back, hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. he releases her and spits out his teeth just as sex machine runs up and swings the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. as the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, sex machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and shoves it in the vamp's heart. he dies and bursts into flames. at that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting position. sex machine grabs a chair and throws it to the ground, breaking it. he grabs the four legs.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself)}
<D>__{goddamn fuckin' vampires.}
<A>__{the biker has turned into captain sex machine, vampire hunter. he stakes two of the vampires as they get to their feet. both spew green blood, scream, die and burst into flames. the third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap, smacks sex machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for a loop. as cat cap runs toward the fallen sex machine, kate jumps on his back from behind. both of them go tumbling into a stack of whiskey cases. sex machine runs over and grabs kate by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. cat cap is lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. sex machine raises his stake as cat cap dies and drives it in the vamp's black heart. cat cap dies and bursts into flames, which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{frost and jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(to sex machine)}
<D>__{we'll put this out. you stake the rest of these fuckers.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{way ahead of ya.}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{what's your name, girly?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{kate, what's yours?}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{sex machine. pleased to meet'cha. kate, let's stake these blood sucker fuckers.}
<A>__{kate and sex machine give each other a high five and go to work staking the dead bodies. jacob and frost beat down the fire with their jackets and whatever else is at hand. a hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered over. little claws scrape their way through. scott stands in front of the window.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{we got a problem!}
<A>__{seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in scott's direction. the hole in the plaster cracks open and out pops a little, fleshy vampire bat rat head. the bat rat, which is squeaking and hissing its head off, tries to squeeze its body through the newly formed hole. seth, gun in hand, runs to the window. he points the .45, point blank range at the head of the bat rat. the bat rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and yanks his head back through the hole. seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment, when... wham ! the bat rat bursts through the hole, like shot out of a cannon, hitting seth in the gut and sending him flying, landing hard on his back. once seth hits the ground, the bat thing (which has the body of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity split runs up seth's body to his juggler. seth's hand grabs the bat's neck, and tries to push it away. but the bat thing has its claws dug in seth's clothes. the bat thing is just inches from seth's face. its mouth is snapping.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{get this bastard off of me!}
<A>__{frost leaves jacob with the fire, comes from behind and grabs the bat thing and yanks it off of seth. sex machine and kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. sex machine kneels by a dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. the body springs up and bites sex machine on the arm. red blood squirts all over. sex machine screams, then brings the stake down in the body's chest. it dies, burns and turns into goo. sex machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt. he quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit. nobody saw it, everybody was too busy. frost holds the flapping, fighting, snapping bat thing in front of him at arm's length. he struggles with it for a while, then... bashes its head against the bar. the first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker, so... frost bashes his head against the bar six or seven times. he then throws the bat thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and rams it in the bat thing's heart. the bat thing coughs and dies. there's a flash of flames, followed by a pile of goo. sex machine and kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while frost, scott and seth wrestle with the bat thing. jacob has put out the fire. everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. outside, the bats continue to try and claw their way in.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{is everybody okay?}
<A>__{everyone mutters "yeah."}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, does anybody here know what's going on?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, i know what's going on. we got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! that's it, plain and simple. and i don't wanna hear any bullshit about "i don't believe in vampires" because i don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. but i do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes i saw fuckin' vampires! now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.}
<A>__{everybody agrees.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you too, preacher?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm like you. i don't believe in vampires, but i believe in what i saw.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{good for you. now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? crosses hurt vampires. do you have a cross?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{in the winnebago.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{in other words, no.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we got crosses all over the place. all you gotta do is put two sticks together and you got a cross.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{he's right. peter cushing does that all the time.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't know about that. in order for it to have any power, i think it's gotta be an official crucifix.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's an official cross? some piece of tin made in taiwan? what makes that official? if a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. the cross is a symbol of holiness.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, i will buy that. so we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{wooden stakes in the heart been workin' pretty good so far.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{garlic, holy water, sunlight... i forget, does silver do anything to a vampire?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{that's werewolves.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{i know silver bullets are werewolves. but i'm pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{does anybody have any silver?}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{then who cares?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{when's sunrise?}
<A>__{jacob looks at his watch.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{about two hours from now.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{yeah, that's true, but i doubt our barricades, that door, those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin' with 'em.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{has anybody here read a real book about vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? i mean a real book.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{you mean like a time life book?}
<A>__{everybody laughs.}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(in a cowboy voice)}
<D>__{john wesley hardin, so mean he once shot a man for snorin'.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i take it the answer's no. okay then, what do we know about these vampires?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{aside from they're thirsty.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{well, one thing, they might got super human strength, but you can hurt 'em.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, that bottle upside the head of santanico didn't kill her, but it didn't feel too good either.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{another thing, you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son of a bitch. the human body is one rough tough machine. but these vamps got soft bodies. the texture of their skin is softer, mushier. you can push shit right through 'em. conceivably, if you hit one hard enough, you could take their fuckin' head off.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you could take their head off.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.}
<P>__{(he points at jacob)}
<D>__{he's a preacher.}
<A>__{frost and sex machine look toward jacob.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{as far as god's concerned, we might just as well be a piece of fuckin' shit. but he's one of the boys. only one problem, his faith ain't what it used to be.}
<A>__{jacob punches seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor. jacob stands over him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i've had enough of your taunts.}
<A>__{seth looks up from the floor.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i'm not taunting you. we need you. a faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us. but a man who's a servant of god can grab a cross, shove it in these monsters' asses. a servant of god can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon.}
<A>__{seth rises.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i know why you lost your faith. how could true holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your children? now, i always said god can kiss my fuckin' ass. well, i changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago' cause i know, without a doubt, what's out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell. and if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it, there's got to be a heaven. now which are you, a faithless preacher or a mean, mother fuckin' servant of god?}
<A>__{jacob has to laugh at that. so does everybody else. jacob sticks out his hand and shakes seth's.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm a mean, mother fucking servant of god.}
<A>__{the laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing. it immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit they're in.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i don't know if i can take two hours of that noise.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you can. you'll take it 'cause ya got no choice. how'd ya like twenty four hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch with only the rotting corpses of your friends to keep you company?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{back in '72 i was in nam, trapped behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead. they thought they killed everybody, and except for me, they were right. but it wasn't for lack of trying. a grenade blew up right next to me, that's why i'm so pretty.}
<A>__{they thought i was dead, so i played dead. they dumped all the bodies in a ditch. all i could do was lie there playing possum. dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour... as frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to sex machine. he's having a hot flash. he can't hear anything. he's looking at frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. then he hears a deep, male voice say:}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{thirst.}
<A>__{"who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. he turns around: nobody's there. no one else in the group seems to hear it, a female voice seductively says:}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{thirst.}
<A>__{we hear sex machine's thought in a voice answer.}
<C>__{sex machine }
<D>__{stop fucking saying that!}
<C>__{two male voices }
<D>__{thirst!}
<C>__{sex machine }
<D>__{that bite weren't nothin'. it just hurt like a son of a bitch, that's all. it barely punched the skin.}
<A>__{sex machine looks at frost, who's acting out his story. the biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. he's describing all the while, but we can't hear anything. all we hear are many voices, male, female, children saying:}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{thirst... thirst... thirst...}
<A>__{sex machine begins looking at the other members of the group in a thirsty way. he stares at each of their necks, closer and closer until he can see the veins on frost's neck actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. sex machine has turned into a vampire. the sound comes back as frost finishes his story.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{...and then when i came back to my senses, i realized i had killed the entire v.c. squadron single handedly. my bayonet had blood and chunks of yellow flesh on it like some cannibal shish kabob. and to this day i don't have the slightest idea how i }
<A>__{sex machine lets out a hideous cry.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{thirst!}
<A>__{frost screams as sex machine grabs hold of him and bites into his neck. the group tries to pull the two men apart. jacob gets his arm around sex machine's neck and tries pulling. sex machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and sinks them in jacob's arm. jacob screams and lets go. seth, kate and scott react to jacob being bit. sex machine grabs jacob and tosses him effortlessly over the bar, crashing into a shelf full of liquor bottles. frost hops around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his bleeding neck.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i been bit! he fuckin' bit me!}
<A>__{sex machine punches seth in the face, dropping him like a sack of potatoes. he smacks the shit out of kate. she goes flying into a table. sex machine turns, seeing frost breaking off a big table leg. frost looks at the big vamp.}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(to sex machine)}
<D>__{you're dead, mother fucker! you're gonna bite me! you just turned me into a vampire, asshole!}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{what are you gonna do about it?}
<A>__{frost, table leg in hand, runs, screaming his head off, straight at sex machine. sex machine's nostrils flare. he raises his meaty fist and pulls it back, so he can really haul off. frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. sex machine lets loose with his punch, seth, scott and kate look up from the floor. jacob rises from behind the bar. frost's face collides with sex machine's fist. sex machine hits frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air. seth sees where frost is heading and says:}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{jacob sees.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{good lord!}
<A>__{frost, in mid air, hits the barricaded, plastered overwindow and crashes through it. sex machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. hundreds of bat things fly into the bar. seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom. behind the bar, jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground. ten bat things are in hot pursuit of seth, kate and scott, who are running for their lives. they get to the door of the back room, whip it open, dive in and slam it behind them. an ugly, fleshy bat thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes. kate and scott push on the door as hard as they can. the bat thing's head, which is inside, screams, howls and snaps in fury. seth turns toward the bat vamp in the door. he sticks his .45 in its big mouth.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you wanna suck something, suck on this!}
<A>__{he fires four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over the wall. kate yells:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we have to go back for daddy!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{daddy's dead.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{noooo!}
<A>__{she spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door and help her father. scott grabs her and pushes her up against the wall.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he's right, kate. daddy's dead! he was too far away. if flinging that door and filling this room with those bat things would save him, i'd fling it. the only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{he needs our help!}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he's beyond our help. you saw him get bit. i saw him get bit. we all saw it. you can't help him. i've got no one left to lose but you. i can't be alone again. we're sticking together.}
<A>__{just then they hear jacob's voice booming from the bar room.}
