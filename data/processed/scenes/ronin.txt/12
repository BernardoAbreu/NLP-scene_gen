<L>__{interior the bar a minute later}
<A>__{sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all here for a reason. with larry and vincent we see gregor, a man from eastern europe. his accent is hard to pin down, but he most definitely has one. gregor has the air of an ex spook, and that's exactly what he is. lastly we see swede blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face. no, he's not stupid he's a sociopath. now sam looks at the group, which grows quiet as he enters. finally, sam speaks.}

<D>__{sorry i'm late...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(a challenge)}
<D>__{what makes you think we're here to meet you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(meeting vincent's gaze)}
<D>__{who else would you be?}
<A>__{vincent turns towards the others, including them in an expansive gesture.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{perhaps the police?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know cops and you're no cop.}
<A>__{vincent smiles at sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for sam to join them. vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes them so that one sticks out, and offers it to sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go }
