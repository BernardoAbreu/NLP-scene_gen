<L>__{exterior motel night}
<A>__{louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside his room and sees ordell's big, black oldsmobile parked in front of the motel. as he approaches, the power window on the driver's side comes down, revealing a comfortable ordell sitting back in his seat looking up at louis.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you know what your problem is, louis?}
<A>__{louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his pockets.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{you think you're a good guy. when you go into a deal you don't go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way. you go in looking for a way out. and it ain't cause you're scared neither. it's cause you think you're a good guy, and you think there's certain things a good guy won't do. that's where we're different, me and you. cause me, once i decide i want something, aint a goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop me from gittin' it. i gotta use a gun get what i want, i'm gonna use a gun. nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get removed. understand what i'm saying?}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what did he do?}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{he put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.}
<P>__{(taking out a viceroy and lighting it up)}
<D>__{and if you know beaumont, you know there aint no way in hell he can do no ten years. and if you know that, you know beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the federal government everything they want to know about my ass. now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. and you best believe it aint gonna be me. you know what i'm sayin'? you gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. i got me so far over a half a million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in cabo san lucas. me and mr. walker make us one more delivery, i'm gonna have me over a million. you think i'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? shit, you better think again.
