<A>__{nicole is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. past nicole we can see whip lying in bed. she has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet. she finishes a handwritten note and places it down. nicole picks up the note and begins to reread it. she hears a car in the driveway she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping whip. she leaves, careful not to make a sound.}
