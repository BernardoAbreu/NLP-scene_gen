<L>__{interior dil's flat night.}
<A>__{she enters; fergus walks in slowly. he looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what you thinking of, hon?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i'm thinking of your man.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i'm wondering why you keep his things.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{told you, i'm superstitious.}
<A>__{she turns toward him and undoes her hair. it falls around her shoulders.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{did he ever tell you you were beautiful?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{all the time.}
<A>__{fergus runs his hand down her throat.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{even now.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{he looks after me. he's a gentleman too.}
<A>__{she draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. they kiss passionately.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{give me one minute.}
<A>__{she walks into the bathroom. fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. she comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. she looks extraordinarily beautiful. he reaches out his hand and grasps hers. he draws her toward him. he begins to kiss her face and neck.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{would he have minded?}
<A>__{she murmurs no. his hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders. close on his hands, traveling down her neck, in the darkness. then the hands stop. the kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. the camera travels with it, and we see, in a close up, that she is a man. fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you did know, didn't you?}
<A>__{fergus says nothing.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{she gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. fergus smacks the hand away.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{jesus. i feel sick }
<A>__{he gets up and runs to the bathroom. she grabs his feet.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{don't go, jimmy }
<A>__{he kicks her away. he runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub. she crouches on the floor.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i thought you knew.}
<A>__{he retches again.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what were you doing in the bar if you didn't know i'm bleeding...}
<A>__{she lights a cigarette. fergus runs the taps. he washes his face, rinses his mouth.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{it's all right, jimmy. i can take it. just not on the face.}
<A>__{fergus slams the door shut. she is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. a trace of blood on her mouth.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{y'see, i'm not a young thing any longer.... funny the way things go. don't you find that, jimmy? never the way you expected.}
<A>__{fergus comes out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she looks up. some hope in her face.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you mean that?}
<A>__{and he makes to go. she grabs him to stop him.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{don't go like that. say something...}
<A>__{he pulls away from her. she falls to the floor.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he drags himself away and runs down the stairs.}
