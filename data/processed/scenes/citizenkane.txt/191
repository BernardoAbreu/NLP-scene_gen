<L>__{interior susan's room night }
<A>__{closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a shadowgraph on the wall, made by kane, who is now in his shirt sleeves. it is about an hour later than preceding sequence.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(hesitatingly)}
<D>__{a chicken?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{no. but you're close.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{a rooster?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{you're getting farther away all the time. it's a duck.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. kane. i know this takes a lot of nerve, but who are you? i mean i'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(looks squarely at her)}
<D>__{you really don't know who i am?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no. that is, i bet it turns out i've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{but you like me, don't you? even though you don't know who i am?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you've been wonderful! i can't tell you how glad i am you're here, i don't know many people and }
<P>__{(she stops)}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{and i know too many people. obviously, we're both lonely.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{would you like to know where i was going tonight when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i didn't run into you and i bet they're not your sunday clothes. you've probably got a lot of clothes.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(as if defending}
<D>__{himself from a}
<P>__{terrible onslaught)}
<D>__{i was only joking!}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{this evening i was on my way to the western manhattan warehouses in search of my youth.}
<A>__{susan is bewildered.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{you see, my mother died, too a long time ago. her things were put into storage out west because i had no place to put them then. i still haven't. but now i've sent for them just the same. and tonight i'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey }
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{ to the scenes of my youth my childhood, i suppose to look again at }
<P>__{(he changes mood slightly)}
<D>__{and now }
<A>__{kane doesn't finish. he looks at susan. silence.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{who am i? well, let's see. charles foster kane was born in new salem, colorado in eighteen six }
<P>__{(he stops on the}
<D>__{word "sixty" obviously a little}
<P>__{embarrassed)}
<D>__{i run a couple of newspapers. how about you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, me }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{how old did you say you were?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(very bright)}
<D>__{i didn't say.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i didn't think you did. if you had, i wouldn't have asked you again, because i'd have remembered. how old?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{pretty old. i will be twenty two in august.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(looks at her}
<D>__{silently for a}
<P>__{moment)}
<D>__{that's a ripe old age what do you do?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i work at seligman's.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{is that what you want to do?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i want to be a singer.}
<P>__{(she thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{i mean, i didn't. mother did for me.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{what happened to the singing? you're not in a show, are you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, no! nothing like that. mother always thought she used to talk about grand opera for me. imagine! an american girl, for one thing and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that mother you know what mothers are like.}
<A>__{a sudden look comes over kane's face.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{yes }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i do sing a little.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(points to the piano)}
<D>__{would you sing for me?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(bashful)}
<D>__{oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{yes, i would. that's why i asked.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, i }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, no, that's all gone.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{then you have no alibi at all. please sing.}
<A>__{susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and sings a polite song. sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, untrained voice. kane listens. he is relaxed, at ease with the world.}
