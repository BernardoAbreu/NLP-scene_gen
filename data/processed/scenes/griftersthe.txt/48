<L>__{interior hotel lobby day}
<A>__{a clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the desk clerk at a half door in one wall. lilly, at 24, enters from the street. this is a definite hooker, with bright maroon hair and a black and white miniskirt. she stops wordlessly at the desk for her key.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(handing key)}
<D>__{your kid's in the back here. he's crying.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{roy? he's always crying.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(sympathetic to roy)}
<D>__{the kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{i like you, too.}
<A>__{the clerk shrugs. he doesn't like this tough broad. he turns and calls back into his office.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{roy, your mother's here.}
<A>__{roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to lilly, sniffling and rubbing his arm.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{so what's your story today?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{they twisted my arm.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(laughing lightly)}
<D>__{only one arm?}
<A>__{he tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{they knocked out my tooth!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{only one tooth?}
<A>__{roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you always say that!}
<A>__{lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he flinches away.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(there's no food)}
<D>__{hah.}
<A>__{lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks roy to the stairs and up. the clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her go.}
