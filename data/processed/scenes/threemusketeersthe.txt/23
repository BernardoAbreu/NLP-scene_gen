<L>__{into view, blocking the lane. fellow travelers shout}
<A>__{complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an obscene gesture. it's a seventeenth century traffic jam. d'artagnan sees anne and constance dismount in the distance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. a man waits in the shadows to escort them. d'artagnan leaps off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot. but he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into porthos' outstretched hand. d'artagnan looks up literally, given porthos' impressive stature and sees the musketeer's muddied tunic, and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly soiled.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(not a glimmer of a grin)}
<D>__{do you know where this sash comes from?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it is a gift from the queen of america.}
<A>__{porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than his knowledge of current affairs. d'artagnan corrects.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{there is no queen of america.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(to pretty woman)}
<D>__{madame augustine, would you excuse me for a moment, i'm going to kill him.}
<P>__{(back to d'artagnan; ever the gentleman)}
<D>__{now, where were we?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(glancing at the ladies; the alley)}
<D>__{i rode through a puddle, muddied your sash, the queen of america except there isn't one, i'm in a hurry, and you were about to challenge me to a duel.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{i was?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{that seems to be the local custom.}
<A>__{porthos lets out a weary sigh. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{everywhere i go, it's always the same. there's always some kid who thinks he's hot with a sword... some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great porthos...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the great who?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{the great porthos.}
<P>__{(when d'artagnan isn't impressed)}
<D>__{me, you idiot.}
<A>__{d'artagnan gives him a blank look.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{don't you know who i am?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the world's greatest talker?}
<A>__{porthos couldn't be more insulted. he sputters with rage.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{all right, you little puke! you want to die? so be it! one o'clock behind the luxembourg! and bring a coffin!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{bring your own!}
