<A>__{ichard dodd on the overpass. he's a cowboy type with a hat and an even thicker accent than holland.}
<C>__{dodd}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{...we, all four of us, all railroad men, standing here, seen about the same thing. the smoke came from behind the hedge and a motorcycle policeman dropped his cycle in the street and run up the embankment...}
<A>__{flashback to the motorcycle... back to 1967. jim and lou walk with dodd and holland near the picket fence. we feel the emptiness of the area now and see the normal amount of traffic driving by.}
<C>__{holland}
<D>__{...we came around here to look for tracks. it rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts. someone'd been standing about here...}
<A>__{the camera shows the "spot" and lou sighting.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{this is a good spot, chief, for the head shot.}
<A>__{jim looks, reliving the moment. later jim and lou stand on the south side of elm street in dealey plaza talking to jean hill, an attractive, 30 ish teacher. her demeanor has a rock solid texas back country conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{i was standing here next to my friend mary mooman, who took the photograph when he was killed...}
<A>__{we see a flash of the moorman photograph a blurry polaroid with the president in the foreground and the picket fence in background. we will return to this photograph in more detail later.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{i jumped out in the street and yelled, "hey mr. president, look over here, we wanna take your picture." he looked up and then shots rang out. mary fell to the ground right away, shouting, "get down, they're shooting, get down, they're shooting." i knew it but i was moving to get closer to him. the driver had stopped i don't know what was wrong with that driver. and then, out of the corner of my eye, i saw this flash of light, in the bushes and that last shot... just ripped his head off, i mean, blood, brains, just blew everything...}
<A>__{flashback to the day of the shooting. we hear the sound of shots and see the grassy knoll from jean's point of view.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{i looked up and saw smoke from the knoll. and everything was frozen seemed like people wasn't even breathing, like you're looking at a picture except this one guy. i saw this one guy running from the book depository towards the railroad tracks. and that was the same man i saw on tv two days later shooting oswald. that was jack ruby. no question about it.}
<A>__{blurry image we're not at all sure what or who or if... but a seed is planted. we see smoke the same smoke bowers saw... then jack ruby in a brown coat running from the book depository toward the railroad tracks. then we see jean's view as she runs toward the knoll along with others. there are yells, shouts, and general confusion.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{it was him i was chasing up the grassy knoll, thinking our guys had shot back and maybe we got one of them. i don't know what i would have done if i had caught him, but i knew something terrible had happened and somebody had to do something.}
<A>__{at the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, confusion...}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{i never did catch him. all i saw in that parking area were railroad workers and dallas' finest.}
<A>__{two secret service types approach her suddenly, and one of them puts an arm on her shoulder.}
<C>__{first agent}
<D>__{secret service, ma'am. you're coming with us.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{oh no, i'm not. i don't know you. we gotta catch this shooter don't you realize?}
<C>__{second agent}
<P>__{(grabbing her other shoulder)}
<D>__{i said you're coming with us. i want the pictures in your pocket.}
<C>__{jean hill }
<D>__{...he put a hurt on me but good.}
<C>__{jean hill}
<D>__{i don't have any pictures! i have to go back and find my friend mary. lemme alone!}
<A>__{the two agents hustle her away.}
<C>__{first agent}
<D>__{hush! just smile and keep walking.}
<A>__{hill, 32 years old that day, is shown into a third floor office of the county courts building which has a view of the assassination area. other secret service agents are there. some 18 people are detained there.}
