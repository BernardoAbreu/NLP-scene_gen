<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{one heineken, certainly, sir.}
<A>__{jeffrey surveys the place after the maitre d' leaves. it is very dark and smoky inside. he has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots frank sitting with some other guys watching dorothy sing. they are sitting two tables away. frank is totally captivated by dorothy's singing and is very serious looking. he looks right up to her eyes. in his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers. again her first number, "blue moon," segues into "blue velvet." this song she sings mainly to frank. when it is over frank continues watching dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly. jeffrey drinks up his heineken and goes back outside.}
