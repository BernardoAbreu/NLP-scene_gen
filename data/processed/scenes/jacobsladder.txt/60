<L>__{exterior office building day}
<A>__{jacob and the others exit the office building. they are jubilant, clasping hands and smacking each other on the back. we watch as they break up. jacob heads for the subway. frank and another group hop a cab. as the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind it. it follows them out of sight.}
<L>__{interior jacob's kitchen night}
<A>__{jacob and jezzie are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen floor. the wastebasket flips over. jacob's hand splashes into the dog's bowl. nothing impedes their passion. jezzie laughs, hollers, and swoons. hands grab hold of table legs. chairs topple. feet bang wildly against the stove. it is all mayhem and ecstacy. and then it ends. jacob's face is ecstatic. he can barely talk and simply basks in jezzie's glow. she looks especially lovely and radiant. they lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{so tell me ... am i still an angel?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(smiling broadly)}
<D>__{with wings. you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.}
<A>__{jezzie kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with her pinky. jacob loves it.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{we're all angels, you know ...}
<P>__{(she bites his earlobe. he winces)}
<D>__{... and devils. it's just what you choose to see.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i love you, jez.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{underneath all the bullshit, just love.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{remember that.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you know what? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{how come? the army?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i will tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.}
<A>__{silence. suddenly jezzie roars like a monster and scares jacob half to death. they laugh and tumble back to the floor.}
