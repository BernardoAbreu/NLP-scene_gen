<A>__{a water speeder driven by paddy accu, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome naboo starship rests. anakin and padme are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.}
<L>__{exterior naboo lake retreat, lodge, garden terracem late afternoon}
<A>__{anakin and padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. behind them, paddy accu supervises two serving girls, nandi and teckla, as they carry the bags into the lodge. anakin and padme stop at the balustrade. padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. anakin looks at her silently.}

<D>__{when i was in level three, we used to come here for school retreat. see that island? we used to swim there every day. i love the water.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i do too. i guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.}
<A>__{padme becomes aware that anakin is looking at her.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{...we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i dont like sand. its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. not like here. here everythings soft... and smooth...}
<A>__{he touches her arm. padme has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{there was a very old man who lived on the island. he used to make glass out of sand and vases and necklaces out of the glass. they were magical.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(looks into her eyes)}
<D>__{everything here is magical.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you could look into the glass and see the water. the way it ripples and moves. it looked so real... but it wasnt.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. real enough, anyway...}
<A>__{they look into each other's eyes. he touches her chin.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i think it's true...}
<A>__{anakin kisses padme. she doesn't resist. she comes to her senses and pulls away.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i shouldn't have done that.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i'm sorry. when i'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{it's the situation... the stress...}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{...the view.}
