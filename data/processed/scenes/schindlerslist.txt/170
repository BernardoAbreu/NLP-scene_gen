<L>__{interior office montelupich prison day}
<A>__{in a stiff backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of racial improprieties amon goeth. to an impassive ss colonel behind a desk, goeth tries to highlight extenuating circumstances:}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{he likes women. he likes good looking women. he sees a good looking woman, he doesn't think. this guy has so many women. they love him. he's married, he's got all these women. all right, she was jewish, he shouldn't have done it. but you didn't see this girl. i saw this girl. this girl was very good looking.}
<A>__{goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is like a wall.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{they cast a spell on you, you know, the jews. you work closely with them like i do, you see this. they have this power, it's like a virus. some of my men are infected with this virus. they should be pitied, not punished. they should receive treatment, because this is as real as typhus. i see this all the time.}
<A>__{goeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere with this guy. he switches tacts:}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{it's a matter of money? we can discuss that. that'd be all right with me.}
<A>__{in the silence that follows, goeth realizes he has made a serious error in judgment. this man sitting soberly before him is one of that rare breed the unbribable official.}
<C>__{ss colonel}
<D>__{you're offering me a bribe?}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{a "bribe?" no, no, please come on... a gratuity.}
<A>__{suddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly confuses goeth since goeth is his inferior in rank. but he isn't saluting goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just stepped into the room behind him.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{the colonel sits back down. scherner pulls up a chair next to goeth.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{hello, amon.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{sir.}
<A>__{scherner smiles and allows goeth to shake his hand, but it's clear, even to goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace.}
