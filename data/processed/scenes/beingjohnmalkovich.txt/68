<C>__{tiny woman}
<D>__{captain mertin?}
<C>__{mertin}
<D>__{what want ye, girl child?}
<C>__{tiny woman}
<D>__{i am not a child, captain mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.}
<C>__{mertin}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{i see. well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. so if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.}
<C>__{tiny woman}
<D>__{i am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.}

<D>__{aye. speak then if ye must.}
<C>__{tiny woman}
<D>__{captain mertin, surely i am a god fearing christian woman like yourself, but alas, i am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high ceilinged rooms mock my stature. nor am i a marrie lady, captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? so i am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?}
<A>__{mertin wipes a tear from his eye.}
<C>__{mertin}
<D>__{woman, your story moves me like n other. me own sister was tiny and then died. therefore, i shall make ye me wife. and i shall build a floor in my building, between the 7th and 8th, which will be scaled down, so from now on there shall be at least one place on god's green earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace...}
