<L>__{interior hotel okura, tokyo night}
<A>__{auction in progress in the huge traditional lobby, where bonsai trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek, international, big money crowd. everyone milling, drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up on the raised platform... ...the auctioneer has a new piece on the block, a 6th century temple scroll, from the asuka period. it is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead digital display, which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously. as we pan the hall, we see... ...all non asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid fire auctioneer. except one. andrew macdougal stands alone in black tie. tall and rugged and polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous. he is bidding on the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.}
<P>__{woman's voice (o.s., subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{pull back slightly to reveal gin, who has stepped to his shoulder. she is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly. breathtaking would be an insult. macdougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her. just raises his program to up the bid.}
<P>__{gin (softly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{you're already over value. by 15 percent.}
<A>__{and now he turns. straight to her eyes. this is not an admiring glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the northern hemisphere. it is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or i will kill you. she shuts up. his glance goes to his obvious bidding rival, a rather butch middle aged chinese woman in an embroidered version of a mao suit. she indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny yorkshire terrier, whom she holds in her stubby hands. macdougal raises back.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{will you stop being stubborn for one sec...}
<A>__{and stops. because he has turned. with the eyes of a lion. being pulled from an antelope carcass.}
<P>__{mac (quietly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{i have a question.}
<A>__{rich scottish voice. impeccable japanese intonation.}
<P>__{gin (brightly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{who the fuck am i?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{that is of no interest.}
<A>__{oh. in spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{what, then?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{why. are we speaking. japanese?}
<A>__{her eyes move across his formidable face.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{uh. i'm showing off.}
<A>__{his eyes scan the length of her gown. her body.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{something of a habit?}
<A>__{she is minus a comeback.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you know the alleged value of this piece from some fucking computer , which has no clue of the price i can turn the scroll around for in 30 minutes .}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no, you can't.}
<A>__{he blinks. no?}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{it's sold.}
<A>__{his great head whips around to see madame mao kissing her pooch, flushed with victory. he stares for a long moment, a veneer of philosophical almost masking his rage. when he turns back...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{are you a confederate of my adversaries? or are you just stupid.}
<A>__{and walks. away. hold on her. feeling like both.}
