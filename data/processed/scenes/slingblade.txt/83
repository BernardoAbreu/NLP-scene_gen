<A>__{he hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar of mustard. he gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering up some leftovers. he picks up a biscuit and opens the mustard jar and runs the knife around it. there's hardly any mustard in it. he dabs a little on the biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.}
