<D>__{wait a second, i have an idea. you go over and introduce yourself. that way you can build me up so when i come along i won't have to brag about myself. tell her i'm good looking and i'm rich and i have a rapist's wit.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i can't tell her you're good looking, lloyd she's got eyes.}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thanks. i love dogs, too. so how}
<A>__{are you involved with them?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; i've even bred them.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? any unusual breeding?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nah, mostly just doggie style. but one time we successfully mated a bulldog and a shitzu.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? that's weird.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. we called it a bullshit.}
<P>__{(breaks out laughing)}
<D>__{just a little breeder joke.}
<A>__{she seems strangely charmed by this.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{anyway, the real reason i came over is because i want to introduce you to a friend of mine.}
<A>__{just then, mary's stepmother approaches. she's holding a martini and looking a little sloshed.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't deny it, lloyd. fraida told me the whole sordid story.}
<A>__{lloyd can't muster a defense.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{look... i was gonna tell you about that. it was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. i swear, you can ask my lawyer.}
<A>__{harry glares at him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well i guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you said it, pal. maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{guess not.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i mean, if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this, then it seems our friendship isn't worth a damn.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe we should call it quits right here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just tell me where to sign, bud.}
<A>__{suddenly they hear the metallic click clack of a gun being}
<B>__{cocked.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{okay, which one of you losers wants to die first?}
<A>__{the guys exchange a look and swallow hard.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i wouldn't pull that trigger if i were you.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{why not? it'll look like just another aspen love triangle. you caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{except you're forgetting one minor etail.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{lloyd and mary look at harry, hopeful.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if you kill us, you'd be killing yourself.}
<C>__{andre}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. in other words, i am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened}
<A>__{idiot }
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{ shut up!}
<A>__{mary sees that they're in deep shit now.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what about my husband? did you kill him, too?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{husband? what husband?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{mary's married, harry.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{no need to worry about melvin.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now this is the last time i will ask: who wants to die first?}
<A>__{harry gestures with his head at mary.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{kill her. the bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. it would've saved us a lot of trouble.}
<A>__{andre points the gun at mary.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no, i will go first, harry. i was the one who got you into this mess.}
<A>__{andre points the gun at lloyd.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, wait, do me first. i'm the one who stole your girl, lloyd. i eserve it.}
<A>__{andre sighs and points the gun at harry. then, as mary and lloyd look on in horror, he fires twice. harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{jesus christ! you killed my best friend, you bastard!}
<A>__{andre smiles.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{if it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited.}
<A>__{he aims the gun at lloyd, cocks the trigger. suddenly, a shot rings out and the gun is blown out of andre's hand. on the floor harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned nicholas andre.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{harry! you're alive!}
<A>__{just them, the door bursts open and several police officers storm in with their weapons drawn.}
<D>__{cop #1 get your hands up, asshole!}
<A>__{lloyd and harry throw their hands into the air. a stunned andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. he reluctantly raises his hands. mary and lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. there's a sudden commotion in the room. pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the athletic beauty. she flashes an id.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{special officer kathryn frick. federal bureau of investigation.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(dumbstruck)}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{good work, harry.}
<A>__{lloyd looks to his friend, confused. harry opens his shirt, revealing a bullet proof vest.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. they slapped this on me and gave me a gun.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(to athletic beauty)}
<D>__{but how did you...?}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{we've been following you two all the way from providence. mr. and mrs. swanson had a homing device plated in the briefcase.}
<A>__{the guys glance guiltily at one another.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, about that dough...}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{every bill was counterfeit and marked.}
<A>__{harry and lloyd exhale a sigh of relief.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior hotel danbury night}
<A>__{there's a swarm of onlookers as andre and j.p. shay are hustled into a police car and driven away. while mary talks to the police, harry and lloyd stare at her lovingly.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she's something, ain't she, har?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you were right, lloyd. she was efinitely worth the trip.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us.}
<A>__{just then, a cruiser pulls up and mary's husband jumps out.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{oh god, baby, i missed you!}
<A>__{harry and lloyd stare in wonder as mel gibson climbs out of the car. mary and mel embrace, then mel turns to the guys.}
<C>__{melvin }
<D>__{i can't thank you enough, fellas. it was so darn dank in that well, i really thought it would be the death of me.}
<A>__{harry and lloyd are too stunned to respond. they look at each other, and we}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior lobby hotel danbury the next day}
<A>__{lloyd and harry come out of the elevator with their meager luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.}
<L>__{exterior hotel danbury day}
<A>__{the guys exit the hotel and approach the bell captain, barnard.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, barney...}
<C>__{bell captain}
<D>__{yes, gentlemen?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony.}
<C>__{bell captain}
<D>__{don't worry about it, gentlemen. the swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone.}
<A>__{this seems to please lloyd and harry. the hearse is delivered to the front door.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well, anyway, thanks again for everything.}
<A>__{they turn to go, but barnard calls to them:}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{where are you two headed?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i dunno. i'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home.}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{why not right here?}
<A>__{harry and lloyd look at each other, confused.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{this joint is a little out of our budget, barney.}
<C>__{barnard}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{oh, i think we might be able to find you a free room somewhere after all, like you once told me, we're all from the same mold.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{you just don't have any dough right now.}
<A>__{the guys are stunned by barnard's generous offer.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{are you on the level?}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{absolutely. we'll just slide you into one of the employee rooms...}
<A>__{the guys beam at this.}
<C>__{barnard }
<D>__{...provided, of course, you don't mind working one or two afternoons a week.}
<A>__{harry and lloyd lock eyes. then:}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you know what, barney, i think we'll take out chances down the road.}
<A>__{barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their hearse and drive off.}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{as the hearse drives down the road, we hear v.o.:}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{since we're finished elbow rubbing, what next, lloyd?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{i say we head due south and try a little nose rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{now you're talking my language. you know i got a weakness for blondes.}
<A>__{as they head toward their next adventure, the camera pulls up, up, up...}
