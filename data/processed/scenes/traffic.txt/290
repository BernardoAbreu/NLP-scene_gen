<L>__{interior jail cell day}
<A>__{general salazar lies on his side, eyes and mouth open. he is dead. javier looks at him through the doorway.}
<C>__{javier }
<D>__{today i'm very proud to announce that mexico, with the help of our american partners, is finally winning the war against narcotics trafficking.}
<A>__{the press begins shouting questions }
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior headquarters, i.n.c.d. mexico day}
<A>__{robert and javi walk through the headquarters, a nondescript government building. robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila envelope. the crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911."}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{the cocaine brand, 911, is an east coast brand, a juarez cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into el paso?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{i'm aware of that.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{so what's it doing in tijuana?}
<A>__{javi looks robert wakefield squarely in the eye. he shrugs.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{let me ask you a hypothetical question: if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{it could mean that, yes.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?}
<A>__{javi thinks along time before answering.}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{yeah, it's possible... if you're prepared to die.}
