<A>__{a workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway. the guide reins up the horse in front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard which are now covered with a narrow red carpet. the guide nods to holmes, who dismounts, starts up the steps, examining the red carpet. as he reaches the top, he looks off. the strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by torches planted in the ground. a couple of workmen are are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance of the tower. as holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.}
