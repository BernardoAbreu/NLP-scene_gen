<L>__{interior garment building: faber reception area day}
<A>__{(night) bree arrives at the head of the stairs as still others press past her on their way down and comes more or less directly up against the thickset receptionist. she is packing her purse, preparing to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at bree who sees no way to avoid the issue.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i have an appointment with mr. faber.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{in there.}
<P>__{(turns, bawls)}
<D>__{mr. faber }
<A>__{bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated, toward a corner of offices: nathan faber nathan stands bending over a bench with back to camera, conferring with another man as bree approaches looking to us, as to her, exactly like his father. we hear the receptionist's voice repeating }
<D>__{receptionist (cont'd) (o.s.)}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{mr. faber }
<A>__{as bree nears him, he straightens and turns a much younger man. bree stops short, recognizing the error.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i'm sorry mr. faber senior.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{my father went home about fifteen minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too good.}
<A>__{she has already started away. he calls after her evenly }
<C>__{nathan }
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{she looks back quickly, smiles nervously }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{it wasn't important.}
<A>__{but we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene until he turns away to other matters. then reception area: receptionist, bree bree returns toward receptionist, awkwardly }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{did mr. faber leave a message for me or anything? mr. faber senior? bree daniel.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{oh, i thought that was for tomorrow.}
<A>__{the receptionist riffles through a stack of assorted envelopes hands one out to bree and promptly takes her way off. out. bree starts to open the envelope then and there but others continue to move past her. she seeks a more private place.}
<B>__{rows of garments}
<A>__{bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else though we continue to hear intermittent voices, o.s. and continue to maintain the sense of other presences. we see her open the envelope closer: bree, envelope she finds nothing inside but money bills totaling fifty dollars. we see her looking for a message, finding nothing. it comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided. she bites her lips in pain. she pushes back out of hiding }
<B>__{receptionist area}
<A>__{ back to the reception area again. (by now this immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene start, moving through the background, and continue to hear an occasional noise or voice o.s.) bree looks about for someone then scouts for a pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer, starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back to mr. faber). then she breaks off from that, takes up a phone instead, dials waits then }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{bree daniel. has he called in yet? well if he does, i'm at }
<P>__{(reads phone)}
<D>__{ two seven eight, three one hundred, and i guess i can wait here five minutes; then i will try from somewhere else.}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{just tell him bree daniel; he knows who.}
<A>__{she hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope. footsteps are approaching in her direction. she glances up apologetically.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{mr. faber, i just wanted to leave this for your father, and i wondered if you'd }
<A>__{she pauses }
<B>__{angle past bree to cable}
<A>__{cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments. in this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure a noise, a gesticulation (actually the gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended as a shushing). bree cries out, turns to run }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{someone }
<A>__{ as we immediately, even as she's turning, cut to: }
