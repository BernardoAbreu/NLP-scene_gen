<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{musty and cramped. a portable shower, a dressing table and not much else. salome takes the snake from around her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table. deck ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{it that mother real?}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{of course he's not real. you think i'd be working here if i could afford a real snake?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{it's a good job.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{you mean the snake.}
<A>__{deckard nods. there's not much costume to take off but she's doing it.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{the best.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{does it eat?}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{his hand reaches out to touch it. as his fingers make contact there's an electric "snap." he jerks his hand back from the shock.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{jeezus!}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{hey! do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?}
<A>__{she slides behind the screen and turns on the shower. deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room like he's inspecting the walls.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{they have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing what's going on.}
<A>__{his eyes are moving over everything she's got.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{i bet i would.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.}
<A>__{and to his amazement he actually spots one. it's down low on the wall. not a good idea to turn his back on work but he can't resist.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{and what if somebody did try to 'exploit' me? who do i go to?}
<A>__{through the hole deckard is looking at a pair of fat legs.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{me.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{and who do i go to about you?}
<A>__{he looks back. she's some out of the shower dripping nude. she's taken off her black wig. her hair is short and blonde. deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit. he stares at her a moment too long.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{hmmmmm?}
<A>__{deckard grins and she returns it. she takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her body. the snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking trying to get back to its mistress. absently, she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.}
<C>__{zhora}
<D>__{you ever get the feeling things aren't the way they seem?}
<A>__{her hand closes around the snake's head. deckard sees it coming but can't move fast enough. she strikes him so hard it knocks him off his feet. before he hits the floor, she kicks him in the stomach. the snake whistles through the air again as deckard rolls out of the way. it slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor. he goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.}
