<L>__{interior roy's rowhouse hallway night}
<A>__{patrick rings the doorbell. sara opens the door slightly, just enough for patrick to see her face. it pisses him off.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's alright. i'm okay.}
<A>__{roy appears in the space behind her, looking out. sara can feel his presence. her eyes implore patrick.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{look. it's not a good time.}
<P>__{(gently shutting the door)}
<D>__{i will see you later... i'm okay.}
<L>__{interior laundromat (southeast baltimore) early evening}
<A>__{the laundromat is empty but for a few customers and nikki. she's loading clothes from two large baskets into washers when her brother diondre, 10, races in. he's grinning from ear to ear.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{diondre, what your butt doin' here?}
<C>__{diondre}
<P>__{(a taunting twist)}
<D>__{i can go where i want. you the one on punishment.}
<A>__{nikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting him. she looks up. patrick's standing in the doorway. diondre runs up to him, holds out the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{diondre}
<D>__{there she go. gimme my two dollars.}
<A>__{patrick pays him. diondre darts out. patrick walks up to nikki. nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a backhanded wave.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{whatever it is, i don't wanna hear it.}
<A>__{patrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long moment just looks at her. the walk there has composed his emotions.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i thought you had somethin' to say to me.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you thought wrong.}
<A>__{an old black woman is avidly, openly watchin' them. patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the laundromat. nikki petulantly follows him there. they sit. patrick looks at her.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in sara's face, start all this drama. what you tryin' to prove, nikki?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you're the one tryin' to prove something. stuck up in her shit like she's somethin' special.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what if she is? what's it to you? you didn't see me trippin' off that howard dude and i could have. i coulda tripped hard, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that was different.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how you gonna call it different?}
<A>__{she stands up. looks down at him. raises her voice.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{because she's white and he ain't. and don't sit there like you don't know what i'm talkin' about, patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(glaring at her)}
<D>__{you don't even know what you're talkin' about, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't? y'all black men, soon as you even think about goin' someplace good, first thing you do is find a white girl to take with you.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{patrick glares in the old woman's direction, then back at nikki.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i thought i was goin' someplace good with you. you the one called me off. but you ain't tryin' to remember that. now you mad. why? because she's white and i like her? i'm with her.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{please. you're with her because she's white. that's what sets me off.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{it ain't got no business settin' you off! me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. so keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself.}
<A>__{nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him defiantly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't think it, i know it. but you go ahead, deny it. that's what y'all always do.}
<A>__{she turns on her heels, goes back to her machine. patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. he holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out.}
