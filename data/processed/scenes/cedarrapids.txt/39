<L>__{interior locker room a little while later}
<A>__{tim finishes showering. he steps out of the shower to find orin helgesson, completely naked. orin has just exited another shower. he smiles pleasantly at tim, also naked.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{oh. i... ok.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i... i really enjoyed your speech, president helgesson.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{you were in there? marvelous. did you like the part about e commerce?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you bet. very much, sir.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{terrific. it's the future y'know. anyhow, i don't think we've...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{tim lippe. down from brown valley, wisconsin. northlands insurance?}
<A>__{a flash of emotion maybe even anxiety on orin's face.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{whew boy. tim, what can i say? i just we're all feeling it. i'm so sorry for the loss...}
<A>__{orin puts a supportive hand on tim's shoulder.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{um, well, it's rough. real rough. like you said in your remarks, roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and...}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{and a pilot. flew a cessna.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah. it's just rough.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{come here, son.}
<A>__{orin gives tim a hug. tim juts his butt out so that their penises don't touch. a janitor enters the locker room, sees this odd embrace, pauses a beat and hurriedly exits.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the embrace runs its course. tim isn't sure where to look.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{tim, i know bill's looking to retire and from the sound of it he's on the hook for a pretty sweet time share.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah, it sounds pretty top notch.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{i want to help him find a buyer, and god knows i will try my darnedest. but and it pains me to say this there's a petition going around trying to rescind all of northlands' two diamond awards.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{i know. but let's be honest, one of the core tenets of the two diamonds is commitment to god. and the way roger passed on... well, some folks are saying that type of activity isn't entirely "godly."}
<A>__{tim shakes his head, disbelieving.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{you have to understand, this isn't some namby pamby local event. this is a regional convention, tim. now, i want to help you, but you're going to have to help yourself too.}
<A>__{orin goes to his locker, removes a folder.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{let me give you a few extra drink coupons for horizons. get down there fellowship and network. buy a few drinks. let `em see the good side of northlands insurance the wholesome side, ok?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{thank you president helgesson.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{please. orin. and if you need anything, tim i mean anything i'm up in the tiffany suite. room}
<A>__{balcony overlooks the pool. tim accepts the stack of drink tickets. he's scared shitless.}
