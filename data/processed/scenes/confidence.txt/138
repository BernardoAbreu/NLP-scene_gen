<L>__{interior tiffany's night}
<A>__{jake and lily enter the store. jake takes a quick moment to case the place a few scattered customers, some being helped by salespeople. all the customers look like the uppercrust crowd you'd expect at tiffany's.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh yeah. this is good. this will do nicely.}
<P>__{(to lily)}
<D>__{this is about confidence. your confidence and their confidence. you get their confidence by giving them yours.}
<A>__{jake leaves lily by the front counter as he starts a slow turn around the store. he casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to mr. lewis, an older, distinguished looking gentleman, being helped by a salegirl, who is scribbling on an order form.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{let me read this back. one silver cattier watch, engraved "to carolyn, the attorney at law. happy graduation, counselor. love mom and dad."}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{one bracelet, engraved "to abby. happy 25th anniversary, love tom."}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{perfect.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{i' ll just go put this in, mr. lewis.}
<A>__{the salesgirl takes the order form and walks away. a change comes over jake. it's subtle posture, facial expressions, a slight tug of an accent but it's there.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{mr. lewis?}
<A>__{mr. lewis turns and looks at jake. there's no real hint of recognition, but jake's smiling up at him like an old friend.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it is you. hello!}
<A>__{jake extends his hand.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{sorry, i }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{jake. jake pearson. i go to lawschool with your daughter. carolyn. we met once or twice.}
<A>__{mr. lewis seems to search for second, then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{of course. jake. nice to see you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{well, it certainly is a coincidence. here of all places! how is mrs. lewis?}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{great. thank you.}
<A>__{the salesgirl returns.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{excuse me? i believe you're holding something far me under pearson.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{do you have a ticket?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you know, this is kind of embarassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and i'm afraid the ticket was in it. but the name's pearson.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{while you're back there, could you make sure that carolyn is spelled with a "y"?}
<A>__{the salesgirl nods and disappears again.}
<C>__{mr. lewis }
<D>__{what brings you down from boston, jake? taking advantage of the long weekend?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{my wife and i are just taking a little vacation.}
<A>__{behind his back, jake discreetly waves lily over.}
<C>__{mr. lewts}
<D>__{carolyn's down this weekend too.}
<A>__{lily approaches. when she does, jake pulls her close and gives her a loving kiss on the lips. it throws lily for a second.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{uh... everything okay?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{honey, this is mr. lewis. carolyn lewis's father. mr. lewis, this is my wife, lily.}
<A>__{lily and mr. lewis exchange handshakes.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm sorry, honey. i'm almost done.}
<A>__{jake taps lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{it's okay. i will be looking for earrings.}
<A>__{jake gives lily another kiss before she leaves.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{attractive girl.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{thank you. actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. she thinks i'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. think i've fooled her?}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{take it from me, you never do. but congratulations. nice to be married, isn't it?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{very much so.}
<A>__{jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's pretending to be. the salesgirl returns.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{we have carolyn with a "y". i'm sorry, there's nothing under pearson. if we had an invoice number }
<A>__{jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i told you. my wallet was stolen. please... check again.}
<A>__{jake takes a nervous look over at lily, who is drying on earrings with another salesperson.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{good luck. congratulations again.}
<A>__{he and jake shake hands.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{thank you, sir. you know, i hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps i could give you something for her? it's a check. we split the cost on a few books and i haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. could you..?}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{jake pulls out a checkbook and pen.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{that'd be a great help.}
<A>__{the salesgirl returns.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{i'm sorry. nothing under pearson.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're sure? this is... just a complete disaster.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{a ring for my wife. alot like that one. in fact, it was that one.}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{that's no problem. we have those in stock.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{thank you. sorry, i'm just a little anxious to give it to her. you take out of state checks?}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{with identification.}
<A>__{jake stops writing on the check and locks up.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i understand that, but i had my wallet stolen last night. is there any way..?}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{jake's anxious look comes back.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i know it's policy, but...}
<P>__{(looking over at lily)}
<D>__{the thing is... it's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. it's a very, very special night for my wife and i. this ring is my gift to her and i think she's going to really love it. i can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. i can send you i.d. later...}
<C>__{salesgirl}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{this is embarrassing.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{jake?}
<A>__{jake looks up and rips the check out from his book.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. thank you very much for doing this. and please tell carolyn hello for me.}
<A>__{jake seems to be lost. mr. lewis looks over at lily, who gives him a friendly smile, then back to jake.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{why don't you let me put the ring on the card and you can write me a check in return?}
<A>__{unseen to mr. lewis, one corner of jake's lip goes up in a grin.}
