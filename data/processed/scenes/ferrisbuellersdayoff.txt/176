<A>__{tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers. cu. cameron, ferris and sloane they're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted strip jointerior cameron's mouth is open in amazement. sloane is embarrassed and revolted.}

<D>__{how does she do that? one goes one way, one goes the other.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{she's probably schizophrenic.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{ferris, this is nauseating me. really. i'm losing respect for you by the bucket.}

<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{who wants to get in?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{cameron looks like a toddler, for christ's sake. i'm talking about a major achievement in false identification.}

<D>__{this kind of thing makes me a little depressed. you may think because i'm the age i am that i'm a sex maniac. that sex is all i think about. but that's not true. i'm a romantic. i think alot of people my age are. we think about love and matters of the heart. and sat scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. it's a terrible thing. and we feel it. i feel it.}
<A>__{he flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an elvis impression. a sappy, do wop track fades up. the club lights go down. cameron and sloane disappear into darkness. ferris stands up from the booth. he strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{you know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. act one was when we met. i loved you at first glance. you read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. then came act two. you seemed to change. you acted strange. and why, i've never known.}
<A>__{he climbs up on the little runway. the stripper disappears in darkness as ferris takes over the spotlight.}

<D>__{honey, you lies when you said you loved me and i had no cause to doubt you. but i'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. now, the stage is bare and i'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...}
<A>__{elvis fades up. the orignal recording. ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the king's trademark ballad sign off.}
<C>__{elvis}
