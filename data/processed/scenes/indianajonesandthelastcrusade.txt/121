<A>__{donovan shouts orders to the troops. indy is followed by various vehicles in the caravan. indy notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far. indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. the tank starts to follow.}

<A>__{cleverly, indy has turned the tank directly into a head on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a kubelwagon. the tank and the kubelwagon smash into each other, the german military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six pound cannon on the turret. indy, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert. he reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where indy is.}
