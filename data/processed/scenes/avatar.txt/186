<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior rainforest day}
<A>__{scorpion gunships darken the sky as they come over the tops of the trees. at the head of the formation is one much larger ship, a monster 150 feet long the general dynamics c 21 dragon gunship. quaritch, next to the pilot of the dragon, surveys the world below like napoleon astride his horse.}
<L>__{exterior hometree}
<A>__{jake and grace are lashed to posts at the front entrance to hometree. the people look up as the dragon and its escort of gunships arrive over the trees. the down blast from their rotors creates a maelstrom of flying leaves and debris. in the dragon cockpit quaritch watches a targeting screen a telescopic image of jake and grace tied to posts.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{well, i'd say diplomacy has failed.}
<A>__{tsu'tey and another hunter hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{i think they mean to cut their throats if we don't back off. make sure you get a nice close up of that. i can tack it onto the after action report.}
<A>__{jake yells to neytiri, tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you have to get out of hometree! run to the forest! please, i'm begging you!}
<A>__{eytukan scowls at jake, then grabs tsu'tey and yells }
<C>__{eytukan}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{take the ikran! attack from above!}
<A>__{tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of hometree. in the cockpit quaritch grows impatient.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{alright, let's get this done. give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door.}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{roger. cs forties. going hot.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{fire.}
<A>__{on the dragon's stub wings the 40mm rocket launchers open up with a barrage of leaping fire which flashes down and k whoom!k whoom!k whoom! the inside of hometree erupts with multiple explosions of teargas. the gas rolls across the confused villagers. they begin to cough and gag. eytukan and the remaining hunters bravely fire at the gunships with their longbows. in the dragon's cockpit, quaritch laughs as arrows clink against the armored windows. amid clouds of teargas, the omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.}
<C>__{eytukan}
<P>__{(yelling subtitled)}
<D>__{everybody outside! go to the forest.}
<A>__{the villagers pour out of hometree. everyone is yelling. piercing screams in the boiling gas. jake, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings. ka whoom! an incendiary round explodes inside the commons. flames roar through the base of hometree. inside hometree it is a burning smoky hell. flames roar up the inside like a chimney. stragglers scramble outside, coughing and dragging wounded with them. high up in the trunk, tsu'tey and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball. outside the fire is driven by the rotor wash toward jake and grace who are still bound tightly to the posts. out of the smoke, mo'at appears in front of jake. she raises a knife and slashes downward. jake looks down, surprised, to see his bonds falling away. he meets her eyes, which are filled with horror, but also something else. call it faith.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<D>__{you are one of us. help us!}
<A>__{jake takes the knife and cuts grace free.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we've gotta move! he's gonna blow the columns.}
<A>__{as grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they run. around them the omaticaya flee in horror and confusion. in the cockpit, quaritch watches as the omaticaya stream away from the great tree, running along roots and branches.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{that's how you scatter the roaches. okay, switch missiles. give me h e's at the base of the west columns.}
<C>__{pilots }
<D>__{copy, switching missiles.}
<A>__{in trudy's samson she hears the other pilots acknowledging quaritch's order.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{screw it.}
<A>__{she takes her finger off the fire control and pulls her aircraft out of formation. pushing in on quaritch, the hometree reflecting in his glasses.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{bring it down.}
<A>__{missiles stream down from the dragon and the other gunships and the base of hometree vanishes in a chain of high explosive blasts. the massive pillars fragment into matchsticks, and the omaticaya watch in horror as hometree groans and starts to move. in a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty tree topples with agonizing slowness. at the banshee eyrie, tsu'tey and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight. they swoop among the branches as the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, moves. it crashes down through the forest canopy, crushing the lesser trees in its path, falling ponderously. hometree hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris. in the dragon cockpit, quaritch surveys the destruction.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{nice work people. alright, let's light it up.}
<A>__{incendiaries launch from the gunships, exploding into gouts of fire in the debris of hometree. the gunships fan the flames through the trees like a fire storm. the omaticaya retreat as a wall of fire advances. jake searches for neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{neytiri! neytiri!}
<A>__{grace is gathering crying children, and herding them away from the fire storm. neytiri stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the inferno. she sees eytukan. a large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear. he recognizes her as she kneels over him.}
<C>__{eytukan}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{daughter take my bow. protect the people.}
<A>__{in his last living moment he places his bow in her hands. she collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief. jake reels out of the smoke. kneels next to her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<A>__{she shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears stream down her face.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{get away from me, jake. go away! never come back!}
<A>__{jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body. sparks and smoke swirl around him. he watches as netyiri kneels, grieving. slumped over, clutching her stomach. keening like an animal. slow motion jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest. utterly shattered. eyes vacant.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. sooner or later though, you always have to wake up...}
