<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{et back here! get back here!}
<A>__{kaufman fires three rounds at the men! he's not a marksman, but one of the guards is winged. whirls around and levels his m 16 at kaufman.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{you stupid old fuck!}
<A>__{he's about to fire when knipp steps in front of kaufman.}
<C>__{knipp}

<D>__{side. least we're supposed to be.}
<C>__{ecurity guard}
<D>__{i'm on my own side now.}
<A>__{the guard takes off after his comrades.}
<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{need some help, mister k.?}
<A>__{kaufman spins around to see cholo walking toward him across the atrium.}
<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{been bit, mister k. i'm a dead man, so i don't care about nothin' no more. still care about you, though. i wanna make sure you come to the same end as me.}
<A>__{lang! clang! clang! the dead things at the glass doors are pounding now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe.}
<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{hey're going to get you, mister k. want them to get you.}
<A>__{kaufman raises his gun and aims at cholo, who aims back with his crossbow.}

<C>__{cholo }
<D>__{ut it down, old man, unless you'd rather die right now.}
<A>__{big daddy appears outside the doors. uses his pneumatic hammer to pound at the safety glass. aufman can't take it anymore. he bolts for a stairway door. cholo shoots. an arrows hits kaufman in the back of his left calf. kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his gun, which skitters kaway. knipp rushes over to help kaufman.}
<C>__{nipp}
<D>__{just let us go, mister demora. let us get out of here.}
<C>__{cholo}
<P>__{(calmly reloading) you can go,}
<D>__{knipp, but not him.}
<A>__{kaufman shakes knipp off. his gun is ten feet away. he heads for it. dragging himself on hands and knees. crunch! the chisel on big daddy's pneumatic hammer is the first tool to penetrate the doors. the glass doesn't shatter; it cobwebs into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin plasticine coating. alarm bells sound! puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into something that looks different, big daddy drops the pneumatic hammer and reaches out. the glass is different. it's soft. flexible. big daddy pokes his hand right through. kaufman has almost reached his gun. cholo shoots another arrow. this one hits kaufman in the shoulder.}
<C>__{aufman}
<D>__{you fucking spic bastard!}
<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{i think we should talk when you're a little less excited.}
<A>__{kaufman has a will of iron. he keeps going, gritting his teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as... crunch! crunch! crunch! more tools penetrate the doors. more hands poke through. aufman looks at his worst nightmare...dead things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.}
<B>__{r m}
<A>__{the commotion distracts cholo just long enough for kaufman to lift his gun and fire nine rounds. ost of the shots miss. two hit cholo, one in the belly, one in the heart. he is slammed against the wall, his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired. it's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead. knipp pulls kaufman onto his feet. they look up to see... big daddy leading his army into the atrium. kaufman aims and fires. a bullet hits big daddy in the upper chest, blowing dead flesh out of his back. the dead man feels no pain, but it focuses on kaufman and starts after him with purpose. kaufman sees something in big daddy's eyes. something that's not dead. kaufman fires again. click! he's out of ammo.}
<C>__{k}
<C>__{nipp}
<D>__{boss. we gotta get outa here!}
<A>__{knipp pulls kaufman to a stairway door. they rush inside. the moment they're out of sight, the walkers forget about them, moving on into the atrium. all except big daddy. that rage is still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.}
