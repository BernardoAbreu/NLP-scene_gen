<L>__{exterior small gravel road day}
<A>__{the family walks up to their car, a blue toyota prius. gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback. it won't lift. mary goes to open the passenger door. locked.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{did you hit it?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{shouldn't have to.}
<A>__{he fishes the keys out of his pocket. presses the remote entry button repeatedly. gabriel tries to open the driver's side door. locked. even noelle knows something's wrong. gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob. unlocks the door and climbs in. opens the door for mary and noelle.}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{i think we left the overhead light on.}
<A>__{he taps it. moves the switch.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{noelle signs her made up representation of "shit."}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{noelle.}
<A>__{gabriel slides the key into the slot. hits "start." nothing.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{battery is dead. least the starter is.}
<A>__{noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how do we...?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{we call the service. that's all we can do.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's just the little battery that's dead, right? the big one is probably fine.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we can't jump it from one battery to the other? cross over somehow?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{who did you marry? macgyver?}
<A>__{he gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. mary follows him out. noticing that he's not dialing...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{are you getting a signal?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no. do you?}
<A>__{she checks her phone. a long beat.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes! one bar.}
<A>__{they're both relieved. finding the aaa card in his wallet, gabriel takes the phone and dials. it's at this moment we notice the familiar green string bracelet around gabriel's wrist. in the back seat, noelle knocks on the window. she signs, asking if everything is okay.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{we're okay. daddy's calling people to help us.}
<A>__{gabriel pulls the phone from his ear. looks at the screen. hits redial. fuck.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{keep trying.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{okay, i will keep trying, mary. but it will keep happening.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{well, what do you want to do?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{he tries redial.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe if you hold it up higher.}
<A>__{humoring her, he holds it at arm's length. no good.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the problem is we're boxed in. it's a canyon.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{where we turned off the main road, it was more open. and higher, too.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's at least a mile.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i can run that.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{so...we stay here?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you okay with that?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. go.}
<A>__{half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a better plan. neither does. gabriel leans down next to noelle's window.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. you take care of your mom, okay?}
<A>__{noelle nods.}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{gabriel gives mary a quick peck and starts running down the road. we move in on noelle, who smiles a little.}
