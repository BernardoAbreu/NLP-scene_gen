<A>__{kale saunters down the stairs....}
<L>__{interior kitchen day continuous}
<A>__{kale enters, notices a few full grocery bags on the counter and the coffee maker brewing. he opens the fridge, sees a new mountain dew twelve pack. he cracks open the carton, pulls out a can, closes the fridge door revealing giles in the flesh, in kale's kitchen. kale jumps, drops the can. it rolls to giles' feet.}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(picking up the can)}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down. robert giles, your neighbor }
<P>__{(gesturing outside)}
<D>__{behind you?}
<A>__{kale glares, breathing hard. giles taps on the top of the dented soda can, hands it to kale. kale doesn't take it. note: giles' shirt should have burnt orange somewhere in it, either in the pattern, stripes, etc...}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i know, how did you }
<A>__{giles puts the soda on the counter as julie comes through the kitchen door carrying groceries.}
<C>__{giles}

<D>__{my fault.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no, it wasn't. you saved my life.}
<P>__{(then to kale)}

<C>__{giles}
<D>__{just glad i could help.}
<P>__{(then; favors julie)}
<D>__{must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house.}
<A>__{kale reacts to that. there's an awkward silence as kale's eyes instinctively glance down to the ankle bracelet.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh... no, it's okay, we're managing.}
<A>__{giles steps closer to kale, bends down to get a closer look at the ankle bracelet.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{i've always been curious about those things, do you mind?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{yeah, i do.}

<D>__{no, no. it's none of my business.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{whoa, hey, dude... you seem like a straight hitter. you ask me, whoever they are deserved it.}
<A>__{kale reacts, surprised at how genuine that sounded.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(stepping in)}
<D>__{okay... i don't think that's the case, and }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i think i'd like to hear his opinion.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{and i think i opened my big mouth again. you're absolutely right.}
<P>__{(then; heading for the door)}
<D>__{i should go.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wait, what about your coffee?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i popped my spanish teacher.}
<A>__{awkward beat. giles turns back to julie:}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{in that case, cafe con leche, por favor?}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(searching bags)}
<D>__{shoot, milk's... still in the car.}
<A>__{julie heads out the door. giles turns to kale. an awkward, silent beat. then }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i like your shirt, by the way. i mean, the color.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{oh, the... that dark orange. always reminds me of texas.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{yeah? you a longhorns fan, too?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{sure, absolutely. even though i've never stepped foot in texas }
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{me neither. had a lot of friends who went there. i stayed in minnesota till i moved here.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{so when you say you "popped" your teacher }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{just a black eye.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{phew, just making sure i wasn't living next to some psycho killer. listen, i get it though. i had plenty of teachers i wanted to just... kill.}
<A>__{giles quickly adjusts his tone as julie comes back with a last bag of groceries:}
<C>__{giles }
<D>__{but no matter how hard it is to hold back, the high road's always the better choice.}
<A>__{as giles says this, he casually sits at the kitchen table. kale eyes him, about to turn and leave, but:}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{kale, could you grab the sugar?}
<P>__{(to giles)}
<D>__{sugar?}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(favors kale)}
<D>__{why not.}
<A>__{kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer. he delivers it to giles as julie brings the coffee, sits at the table.}
<C>__{giles }
<D>__{thanks, man.}
<A>__{kale turns to leave again.}
<C>__{giles }
<D>__{oh, hey, kale...}
<P>__{(as kale turns back)}
<D>__{nice to finally meet you.}
