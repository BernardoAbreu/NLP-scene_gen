<L>__{interior bina's bedroom afternoon}
<A>__{alike sits on bina's twin bed, looking around and really taking in the room for the first time. she reaches over and picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf. bina fishes around in a rack of cds.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{who gave you this?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{what the bear? my dad.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{no, this.}
<A>__{alike holds the figurine out, bina looks at it over her shoulder.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{oh that. girl, my stupid ex boyfriend gave me that.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{oh. cute.}
<A>__{bina opens a cd case and pulls the booklet out.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{not really. i mean i guess it was at the time.}
<A>__{bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the room and hands alike the booklet.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{anyway, this is the other artist i was telling you about. her stuff is like, bouncier.}
<A>__{a buoyant afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. bina plops down on the bed next to alike.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{this is straight. you'll burn me a copy?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{yeah, i have a bunch of other stuff, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so who do you hang out with? i don't really see you with anybody.}
<A>__{alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. she pulls out her composition book. awkward silence.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{i didn't mean it like that. i was just asking because i was curious. i don't really like anybody that goes there either.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{my friend laura used to go there. not now, but she's going back.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{oh because, i was just gonna say i'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to.}
<A>__{bina waves her hand at the radio.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{they play this kind of music.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{sure. how'm i supposed to dress?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{you don't dress. you just come however. come as you are.}
<A>__{alike nods.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{can i see?}
<A>__{bina snatches the book from alike's hands and starts flipping through pages before alike can answer.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{yeah...but that's mainly old stuff, though.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{this is the one you did today?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{bina offers the journal back to alike. alike reaches for it. bina pulls it away at the last second an impromptu game of keep away.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{take it.}
<A>__{alike misses again. the girls crack up.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{sorry, here.}
<A>__{bina yanks it away again. alike gives up, still smiling.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{you play too much.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{seriously, it's right here. just take it.}
<A>__{alike summons the courage for one last swipe. she manages to grab it but bina doesn't let go right away. the girls lock eyes during the extemporaneous tug of war.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{thank you...}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{you're welcome...}
<A>__{beaming with her victory, alike busies herself with the journal. bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next foray. she dances the moose up alike's arm and plants an exaggerated peck on her cheek with it.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{mmmwaahhh!}
<A>__{the girls erupt into renewed giggles. bina tosses the stuffed animal aside and scoots closer to read over alike's shoulder.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{what's so private?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{nothin', just my writings...}
<A>__{bina studies alike's profile. she leans in and pecks alike on the cheek. alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at bina sidelong. bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss on alike's lips. alike pulls away. bina tenses for the verdict.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{why'd you do that for?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{sorry }
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry. i just umm...i gotta go.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{i thought }
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door, bina flounders in her wake.}
