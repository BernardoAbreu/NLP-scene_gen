Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks it, eyes wide open and glassy. An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.
