<A>__{as prince moves into a shadowy corner. angle on the door as haven enters and looks around. he sees no one. the place seems utterly deserted. it is soundless. camera follows haven as he moves slowly. he has replaced the gun, but he is alert. angle on prince as he watches haven, now a perfect target, not looking in his direction. prince raises the gun a little, but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly. shot of haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. now facing towards the shadow where prince is hidden. he stands ready and rigid for a long still moment. when there is no further sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs. angle on prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as haven goes to the stairs. prince is ready to shoot again, but now the angle on haven up the stairs is no good. he lowers the gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow.}
