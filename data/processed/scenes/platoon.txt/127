<L>__{int exterior chopper jungle day}
<A>__{chris and king hustling big harold's 250 pounds into the chopper. climbing in with him. wolfe, barnes, ace running in with them. the perimeter is bare. chris' eyes flitting over barnes as he jumps in. the chopper lifting off as another explosion rocks the area. the door gunner sees something, opens up. big harold, cursing, looks chalky but hog happy as he manages a glance down at the jungle. his right leg is gone. tears are rolling out of his eyes.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{man, you gonna be in japan this time tomorrow, big harold.}
<C>__{big harold}
<D>__{yeah, i'se lucky dis time, what's a leg to get the fuck outta here ...}
<P>__{(at the nva)}
<D>__{eat ma shit, you motherfuckers!}
<A>__{he sinks back, sick. chris' eyes sudenly fix on something. he can't believe it. he shoves king, points. king sees it. both stunned. barnes is looking. so's lt.wolfe, so's ace. so's the door gunner. elias is coming out of the jungle. staggering, blood disfiguring his face and chest, hanging on with all his dimming strength, looking up at them trying to reach them. chris shakes wolfe, his words drowned out by the roar. the chopper captain looking down, dips. his co pilot pointing. the nva are coming out of the jungle, closing on the spot where elias is. incoming rounds are hitting the chopper. the door gunner maniacally firing. barnes looking down at the man, can't believe it. elias is on his last legs now, obviously being hit by the incoming fire of the nva. he falls to his knees, still stretching upwards for life. the chopper captain shakes his head at wolfe. the chopper dips one more time firing at the nva, low and fierce over the jungle. chris looking back in horror. elias crucified. the nva coming out now by the dozens from the treeline. elias crumbling to the ground. obviously dead or dying.}
<C>__{helicaptain on radio}
<D>__{... we still got one on the deck. bring the gunships in.}
<A>__{barnes drawing in. chris looking at him in revulsion. he knows. barnes sees his look, ignores it, all of them sitting there silent, living with that final horrifying image of elias.}
