<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{the two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked cars across the street from the mini mart. through the store window they see the old alien proprietor behind the counter. his eyes go wide as kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump shotgun and aims it right at him. the raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door. sykes and tuggle react to the firepower inside.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you got your vest?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{of course. right in the trunk of the car.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, that's comforting. mine, too.}
<A>__{through the store window the robbery continues in pantomime. kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun, yelling orders in the alien language. the proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register. the proprietor's wife, a middle aged alien woman, stands in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear. the raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired. sykes and tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance.}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{watch the driver. i'm going for a better angle on the door.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i got him. don't get pinned.}
<A>__{tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater corner across the intersection. through the store window sykes sees kipling grab the bag of cash, shove it in his coat pocket. bills fall out, but he doesn't care. then, without warning, kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the proprietor's chest! the proprietor slams back against the shelves, slides to the floor. kipling leans over the counter and fires another round into the proprietor.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{aw, shit.}
<A>__{tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the shots. the human driver of the getaway car (parked at the curb a few doors down from the mini mart) glances up, spots tuggle. he leans on the horn, reaches for a machine pistol on the seat next to him.}
