<P>__{shooting script (final)}

<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior operating room day}
<A>__{a tense surgery in progress. meters flicker, instruments flash in the bright overhead light. in the midst of it all stands dr. david ravell, 35. the master of his domain. ravell leans forward so a nurse can mop the sweat from his brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure. his co workers sigh collectively with relief.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to asst. surgeon)}
<D>__{close her up, will you?}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor day}
<A>__{dr. ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted. without his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome. two nurses follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring: chloe, 25, raven haired and striking, and jasmine, 24, an exotic mix of african american and asian. blake daniels, 58, the silver haired chief surgeon, rushes up the corridor. on his heels is dr. lonnie walsh, 33. lonnie is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to david. in everything. the look on blake's face stops david in his tracks.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{there's been a train crash near santa barbara. they're flying an aortal trauma here now. how can i ask you this, david...}
<A>__{david rubs his eyes. thinks about it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can do it, blake.}
<A>__{his bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although chloe exchanges a quick, covert glance with lonnie.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{is he crazy, jasmine? he's been on his feet for fourteen hours.}
<C>__{jasmine}
<D>__{chloe, it's been this way since leslie died. losing himself in his work, poor thing...}
<C>__{younger man's}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{... i will give you something to lose yourself in...}
<C>__{older man's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{excuse me, miss?}
<A>__{pull back to reveal: we are looking at a television screen behind the counter of a small town diner. insert: fair oaks, kansas}
<L>__{interior tip top diner day}
<A>__{quaint, midwestern eatery. knick knacks and photos abound. the booths and counter are packed with locals. a family dining section off in one corner. two guys sitting at the counter in team jackets. the older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup. but his waitress, standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. she's completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered, fuzzy tv sets. betty sizemore, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform. two other waitresses attend to customers behind her. the younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera. but the older one, still wants coffee. he gestures toward betty.}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{miss?}
<A>__{betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front of him. without taking her eyes from the tv, she pours the java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.}
<C>__{older man}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{very impressive. that is very...}
<P>__{(turning to others)}
<D>__{did anybody see that?}
<A>__{the local guys around him don't even bother to look up. of course, they've seen it before. betty smiles.}
<C>__{older man}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{thank you. could i bother you for a little more...?}
<A>__{before he can even finish, betty is topping him off with milk.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{skim, right?}
<P>__{(tears open an equal)}
<D>__{and half a pack, if i remember correct...}
<A>__{the older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes out. he is flabbergasted by her attention to detail. she looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{you know, you're never too young to start on a lean meat substitute...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you wanna try some turkey bacon on that?}
<C>__{younger man}
<D>__{you want a tip when i'm through?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's your body...}
<A>__{betty turns back to change pots. the older man watches her intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.}
<C>__{younger man}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{that's right, so why don't you get up off it...}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{wesley...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{i've told him the same thing. thanks for the suggestion.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye always on the tv as she approaches two local types. sheriff elden ballard, 32, a short, tightly wound little man, sitting at his own booth. ballard is spit and polish all the way: creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes. badge proudly displayed. he sits with roy ostrey, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter. betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him. another smile.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{hi, betty. you're looking good...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{thanks, roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. i liked your editorial this morning...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, appreciate it. i was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...}
<C>__{ballard}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{yeah, it was great. really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you know, elden, some people actually read more than just the classifieds...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that lonelyhearts column?}
<P>__{(chuckles to himself)}
<D>__{i will take a refill there, betty...}
<A>__{his cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hey, sheriff. how's everything?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{... i meant your food.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{oh, right... 's fine. thanks.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i thought you said the eggs weren't...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{it's fine. mind your own meal...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you should get the order you want.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{and you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{it's no big deal, betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{there's yolks in there, huh? it's no prob'... gotta keep you on track.}
<A>__{betty grabs ballard's plate without another word, gives him a reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off. he smiles appreciatively after her, then turns on roy.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{why you always gotta embarrass me? i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{they're just eggs, elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{... plenty}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{mind your own business. you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...}
<A>__{still carrying ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{come on, guys, i told you it's egg whites only for the sheriff...}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{... i put him in that 'zone' thing. cook #1 well, it better be a pretty good size zone if he's in it...}
<A>__{betty and the cooks share a quick laugh. they move to change his order while betty glances up at the tv.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor return to tv screen}
<A>__{lonnie catches up to blake in the corridor.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{blake, i can handle that transplant!}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{we need someone with the right kind of experience, lonnie.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{even if he's falling asleep on his feet?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{lonnie, it's a complex procedure. why don't you observe?}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{i'm not some snot nosed resident fresh out of medical school, blake.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're a good doctor, lonnie, but you're not david ravell. i've made my decision. now, if you'll excuse me ...}
<A>__{blake exits. the camera moves in to hold on a closeup of lonnie's face as he simmers in anger. music soars.}
<L>__{interior tip top diner day}
<A>__{plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the cooks. one of them turns the tv off by remote.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hey! we were watching that! cook #1 the other girls've got orders up... we're not one 'a them goddamn nelson families, y'know.}
<A>__{betty snatches up several plates to help out. ballard's food appears with a clatter of porcelain.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's "nielson"... cook #1 yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them, neither.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{go on now...}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{when you gonna get those things fixed, anyhow? cook #1 when you all quit watching 'em for a living...}
<A>__{frustrated, betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name. she moves off toward four local guys in a booth jangling their empty cups. betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills. when a hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring. absently, betty takes a look around the restaurant. the other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill. alarmed, she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior tip top diner kitchen same time}
<A>__{three waitresses, along with the dishwasher and two cooks are standing in a row waiting for her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{... alright, i get it, no more tv. sorry.}
<A>__{no one moves, then darlene leads them in a huge surprise! they produce a life size cardboard cut out of dr. david ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs. betty backs up in disbelief.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing! where did you ever find this?}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{on the goddamn internet, where else?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're joking... waitress #1 ... nope, got him at "t.v. hunks with sweet little asses.com." waitress #2 seventy five dollars... cook #1 ... seventy eight fifty.}
<P>__{(everyone looks at him)}
<D>__{well, i paid for the damn thing, i oughta know. waitress #2 c'mon, betty! pose with him!}
<A>__{betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man. a flash photo is taken. a cupcake with a single candle is placed in her hands.}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{one candle... uh oh, you're getting up there! doesn't david like 'em young?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm over the hill, what can i say?}
<A>__{darlene gives betty an envelope with cash showing.}
<D>__{waitress #1 a little something for those nursing classes you've been wanting to take...}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{... but keep putting off thanks to a certain husband we won't mention...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh, guys, you didn't have to do that!}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{so how you gonna celebrate? del takin' you into wichita for a big fancy dinner?}
<A>__{the others laugh; they know better. so does betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, dairy queen, maybe... oh, i should probably call him. thanks, you guys... cook #1 alright, alright, come on... i'm not running no bed & breakfast, we got customers. let's go...}
<A>__{smiling, betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about.}
<L>__{interior sizemore motors del's office day}
<A>__{the trailer office of a small time car dealership. as the phone rings, the camera pans across pictures of del sizemore,}
<L>__{35, dressed as napoleon, caesar and abe lincoln, arms raised}
<A>__{in a high energy sales pitch. the phone rings again. we see a framed certificate of achievement from general motors, dated 1986. after the third ring an answering machine clicks on. it's loud.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<P>__{(del's voice)}
<D>__{hello there! you've reached sizemore motors, home of the best selection of used general motors cars in the big springs fair oaks area. we can't come to the phone right now 'cause we're out making a sale, so leave us a message; better yet, come on down and steal one 'a these beauties right out from under us! coffee's always on!}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{hi del, it's me. i guess you're busy.}
<L>__{interior sizemore motors trailer office day}
<A>__{del's very busy. he's on the rented sofa in the trailer's lounge, screwing his secretary, joyce. but as he rocks the couch, he's listening to betty's message.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i know you want the oldsmobile back tonight, so... i was wondering if i could take one of the new buicks.}
<A>__{del pulls out and lurches across the room. he reaches for the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet. he gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around the desktop until he finds the phone.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{so, call me when you }
<C>__{del}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa! hang on a second there, baby. why do you need one of the new buicks?}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{oh, you're there. you sound out of breath.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i ran back in to get the phone.}
<A>__{the answering machine is on, so their voices are booming. the phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get back to joyce. he motions for her to join him but she remains where she is, fuming.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and }
<C>__{del}
<D>__{what's so special about it?}
<A>__{long pause. joyce looks at del, incredulous. then pissed off. he signals to hold on.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{sue ann's taking me out and i thought it might be fun to go in a nice car...}
<A>__{joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up her panties. del shoots her a look that says 'i'm not finished yet!' they pantomime frantically back and forth until joyce throws him the finger and slams out the door.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. look, you don't need a lesabre to go out with sue ann. take the blue corsica. i will see you when i get home.}
<A>__{he throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window to get joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.}
<C>__{del }
<P>__{(through the pane)}
<D>__{shit! joyce, open the damn gate, will you?!}
<A>__{as del zips up his pants joyce trudges across the lot to bring in the "closed for lunch" sign and open the gate. del silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a moment. he takes in the banners, the signs, etc.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{... that's what we need, some goddamn flags.}
<L>__{interior office trailer later}
<A>__{betty enters the office. joyce is on the phone. she looks up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the caller.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{he's out pricing banners... i don't expect him back.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{"banners?"}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{you know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.}
<A>__{betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set joyce gives her.}
<C>__{joyce }
<D>__{'s too bad about the lesabres... they're a really sweet ride.}
<A>__{as joyce prattles on, betty notices the buick lesabre keys on a rack behind her. she sidles around joyce, deftly removes a set from the hook and drops them in her purse. she smiles and starts to wave goodbye as joyce puts her call on hold.}
<C>__{joyce }
<D>__{need something else?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, i was just... how you doing?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{great. good. content...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh. how come?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i dunno. job satisfaction, i guess...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's things at the tip top?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{they're fine... you miss it?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{you must be joking.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hmm.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, del get that car he sold you up and running yet?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{'kay, good. bye, then...}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(back to phone)}
<D>__{anyway, i'm thinking easter, 'cause i just fucking love pastels.}
<A>__{she whispers, then laughs loudly as betty leaves.}
<L>__{exterior sizemore motors day}
<A>__{the cardboard doctor is standing next to betty's olds. she thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him into a blue corsica. he lands with his face against the passenger window. she stands for a moment by the corsica, dangling the lesabre keys before her eyes. suddenly, she jumps inside the chevrolet and slams the door.}
<L>__{exterior sizemore motors trailer park day}
<A>__{the blue corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the street. the car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row of battered airstreams. betty gets outs of the chevy and looks back: the handsome face of doctor david ravell is staring at her from the car.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh, christ, what am i gonna do with you?}
<A>__{she goes back to pick him up, then starts off.}
<L>__{exterior trailer park same time}
<A>__{a row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling driveway. betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.}
<L>__{exterior sizemore motors same time}
<A>__{she tosses the cardboard "david" over a concrete slab wall, climbs over herself and walks straight to the lesabres. her key opens the last one maroon. she puts the doctor on the passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car smell. joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the phone. she misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we deserve this.}
<L>__{interior lesabre driving day}
<A>__{betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural kansas roads, wheat fields for miles on both sides of her. the radio is blasting bonnie raitt and she's singing along. she sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h. ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h. she turns the radio up louder. when she approaches a sign saying "you are leaving kansas" betty suddenly becomes self conscious. she eases up on the gas ... slows down ... does a u turn and heads back toward fair oaks. she glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.}
<L>__{exterior betty's neighborhood later}
<A>__{betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into a driveway. she parks in a detached garage and looks over at the cardboard david. there's no way he's going in the house. she puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.}
<L>__{exterior sue ann's house same time}
<A>__{she walks several houses down. on her way to the door we hear a dog barking, children and general commotion from inside. sue ann rogers answers betty's knock. her hair is matted with sweat as she struggles with children, ages 4, 3 and 6 months. suddenly, sue ann is hit by an errant rubber ball.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{hey, darling... oww! sorry, got my own little gulf war going on here.}
<A>__{betty takes the baby as sue ann pulls a videotape from a shelf. it's all one move; they do this every day.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{did you watch it yet?}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{sure did. i will tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yep. hey, i got a surprise for tonight. we're going to the starlite in style!}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{oh, betty }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i will give you a hinterior if you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a jaguar...}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{honey, i'm really sorry, i was gonna call you about tonight. larry's got a lodge meeting. there's no way i can get a sitter this fast.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{no... what about your sister?}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{i can't ask her again nathan, stop it! jesse, don't take that, hit back! i feel terrible, hon.}
<A>__{after a beat ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{you sure? maybe next week we could...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{uh huh. no, we'll do it later. 's only a birthday, right? i will have another one next year...}
<A>__{betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to sue ann, who hands her the videotape.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{aahhh...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so what color is it?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{the lesabre!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{maroon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i stole it.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he wasn't going to let us use it, so i just took it.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{oh, i wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, me too.}
<C>__{sue ann}
<D>__{sorry, hon. happy birthday...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i gotta go make dinner.}
<A>__{betty throws her a look as sue ann closes the door. betty turns around, frustrated. she starts yanking her apron off as she crosses the street.}
<L>__{interior betty's house day}
<A>__{a low end ranch. a worn out sofa and loveseat form an 'l' that dominates the living room. romance novels line a small bookcase. six canaries in cages chatter away in the kitchen. del sits at the dining room table, agitated. he is presently attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of wonderbread. all we hear is a fork clicking and birds chirping. betty stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her uniform and quietly eating a salad.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure you don't want any salad?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i told you. sue ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{she's not comfortable in a corsica? 's got air and leather...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i took the blue corsica, del. relax.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{all right, then. actually, i'm glad you're going out. i got something going on tonight. some serious clients, with real potential.}
<A>__{del belches, smiles, then clucks at the birds nearby.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{... like the water purifiers?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{or the vitamins? or the...?}
<A>__{del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at her.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i got you, del...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{... well, then you ain't got much.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh, i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, who're these clients?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{couple 'a guys in from outta town. they want to see the new lesabres.}
<A>__{betty hides her reaction.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{and i don't need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just knock it off, 'kay? anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{they're new to us...}
<A>__{truce for a moment. del plucks a copy of soap opera guide from betty's purse while absently taking a bite from betty's cupcake. he narrowly misses the candle.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{jesus... you know these actors are mainly models, which are mainly fags. they've done studies. the rest're assholes. but you know what bugs me most about these soaps?}
<A>__{she silently mimics him as he says...}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{it's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, i guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, del?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{that is a skill!}
<A>__{del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the canaries chirp and sing excitedly at his approach.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{be back later... clean up.}
<A>__{he exits. she collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the sink and starts to wash them. then she stops.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what the hell am i doing?}
