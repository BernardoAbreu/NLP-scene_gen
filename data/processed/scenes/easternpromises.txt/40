<L>__{exterior london street night}
<D>__{nikolai is driving anna through the rain swept streets. the wipers beat time as they drive in silence. as nikolai holds the steering wheel, anna sees the intricate detail of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{so you're a midwife. jesus. anna smiles politely.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{what's it like?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you get used to it. a pause. nikolai seems vaguely horrified at a memory.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i didn't faint, but it was close.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how many have you got? nikolai half shrugs. pause.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{what, you don't know?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah, i know, i know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? thinking about it. this time of year. they're back in yekaterinburg. in the forests. near the mountains. a long pause.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{left here. nikolai turns.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{so semyon employs you?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i'm... sort of freelance.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you said he'd fire you. nikolai doesn't answer. anna decides she can be bold.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{did you ever meet a girl called tatiana?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i meet lots of girls called tatiana.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she was pregnant.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{in that case, no, i never heard of her. anna doesn't care for the smile on nikolai's face.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she died last night on my shift.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i thought you did birth.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sometimes birth and death go together.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she had needle punctures all over both arms. dehydration, emaciation. early presentation of syphilis. probably a prostitute. at the age of fourteen.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(quickly, without a pause)}
<D>__{you know what? i hate the rain. this time of year. you ever been to russia at christmas? man, snow that covers your whole house. nikolai glances at anna in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{oh yeah. and the ice. whole lakes covered in ice. you don't want to walk across them, though. ice gets thin where you least expect it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you think semyon's son knew her?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{like i said, i'm a driver. i go left, i go right, i go straight ahead. that's it. anna nods, her curiosity and suspicions aroused. nikolai glances at her.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{just here is great. nikolai pulls over and anna opens her door to escape.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{how much do i owe you?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{christmas present.}
