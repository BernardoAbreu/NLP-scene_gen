<L>__{interior klute's apartment day}
<A>__{the empty apartment. he enters, switches a light on (dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot propped up on it. footsteps and a rap at the door. he looks up, but doesn't move, doesn't answer. bree opens it, enters. there are tear tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying. she tries to smile, tries to explain her wants. then with the unhurried, graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{if i asked you something, would you not laugh? asked you to look at something?}
<A>__{she pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on her arm a freckle. he peers at it then at her puzzledly.}
<C>__{bree }
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{i thought it was maybe changing shape or something.}
<A>__{klute looks at it again. judiciously he shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. she compares, is reassured. embarrassedly, she tries to smile. it is unsuccessful. she gets up and moves about. her manner in general is totally unguarded, honest, undramatic, searching.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{look i hate everybody; and i'm sorry for everybody; and i'm scared all the time.}
<A>__{he only grunts. a sound like 'ok' or 'all right' an invitation to leave. but she won't be driven away. more urgently, helplessly:}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{look, i don't know either. it's like the only thing i know how to do i feel safe.}
<A>__{she's left the door a little ajar. he widens it for her.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{it's been a full day.}
<A>__{she pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. a little more angrily:}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{we did this before.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{well all right. but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right.}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(evenly, slowly)}
<D>__{i don't like getting splashed.}
<A>__{she accepts it decently. tries to smile again, nods.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{ok ok}
<A>__{she gestures, tries to find something more to say, moves by degrees toward the door and would succeed in leaving. but then:}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ bree }
<A>__{standing still, she starts again to cry and bravely to keep the crying to herself. the child bereft. he contends with himself, then crosses to her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. a completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving of comfort. she clings, trembles, burrows. then a series of dissolves: the street outside, at different times of night interposed, with bree and klute at different times of love, as follows:}
