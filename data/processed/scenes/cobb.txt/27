<L>__{interior mountain lodge night}
<A>__{stump in the front door the place is enormous and barely lit. taxidermied game hangs on the wall. stump is terrified. a man is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news paper. dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos. he also seems out of place.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{mr. cobb?}
<A>__{the man looks at stump and points upstairs without speaking. more crashing sounds from upstairs.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{mr. cobb?}
<A>__{the silence is shattered by a scratch, then violin music from upstairs. static suggests a record is playing.}
<B>__{angle on stairs}
<A>__{stump climbs the stairs with caution until he's just outside the half open door from which light spills. he hesitates...}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{hello? mr. cobb?}
<A>__{a gunshot rings out ripping through the door. stump is terrified he gasps for air.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{thank you very much, mr. cobb, but i don't need this job that bad.}
<A>__{stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but another gunshot rings out shattering a hanging lamp. stump freeses one more time. silence. then the voice }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{yes, mr. stump you do need this job that bad.}
<C>__{cobb }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now come in here and meet the great ty cobb.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i won't hurt you.}
<A>__{stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway he does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate. and sees: pov shot ty cobb lying in bed in a robe. unshaven. bottles of booze and food everywhere. and bottles of pills sit on every surface. two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. a small record player sits next to he bed. a record spins, filling the room with fritz kreisler violin solos. he places the gun on his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices. when he speaks it is without a snarl, without threat simply, even sweetly, he says:}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{on the violin fritz kreisler. i'm a great admirer of his. i'm also a great admirer of yours.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{but you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{sir, i am the most successful sportswriter in america and not merely a 'moderate success.'}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{give me those pills over there.}
<A>__{stump retrieves some pills that cobb is pointing towards. cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of scotch. momentarily revitalized, cobb hands stump a folded letter which stump opens to read.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown, new york. you're taking me there when is it?}
<C>__{stump}
<P>__{(looking at the letter)}
<D>__{a few weeks.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{all the great ones will be there the great mickey cochrane will be there! hornsby, sisler, ott, the waner brothers... we used to have some parties, stump, i will tell ya that right now...}

<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i won't forget.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{look at me closely, al...}
<P>__{(with utmost sincerity)}
<D>__{lie after lie has been written about me my whole life i've been misunderstood.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're gonna tell the real story of ty cobb.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{what's the 'real' story?}
<A>__{cobb climbs slowly out of bed. his words are reasoned and not without passion.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's why you're here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see, there's two kinds of writers. the kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects... that's you.}
<C>__{cobb }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that could be you. because i am that subject.}
<A>__{cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window. the table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and booze.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(suddenly bellowing)}
<D>__{jameson! get your ass up here!}
<A>__{cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him. then, suddenly, he holds up his hand. a calm comes over him as he stares out the window into the snowy woods. his rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mmmmmm...}
<A>__{pov shot woods in moonlight near the lodge. a bank of snow and a large buck moves into view. close on cobb's face his eyes light. a flare in his nostrils. a twitch. and utter calm.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{jameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in the back of the room. he takes notes when cobb speaks.}
<C>__{jameson }
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{cobb continues staring out the window at the buck.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{there's a small oil company near bakersfield called honolulu oil, sitting near the elk hills reserve...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want you to buy all the stock you can.}
<C>__{jameson}
<D>__{honolulu oil?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that. i got a hunch...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{stumpy, c'mere...}
<A>__{cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly. stump crosses and stands behind cobb, sharing the view.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i can take that buck. what'ya think?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{with a pistol? no way.}
<A>__{cobb smiles and loads the revolver. he pushes the window which swings slowly open. pov shot buck in moonlight searches for leaves to eat in the snow. serene. unaware.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(to jameson)}
<D>__{there's a board meeting of coca cola in georgia next week. call them up and tell them i can't make it for medical }
<P>__{(correcting himself)}
<D>__{ personal reasons...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... and sell all the 3 m stock we got.}
<B>__{cobb}
<A>__{raises the gun he wobbles badly and steadies himself. the gun shakes. then steadies. stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre action. pov shot buck raises its head just as... kablam! the revolver fires with a violent kick. the buck spins and runs back into the woods, kicking snow and disappearing in the brush.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{got him.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{like hell you did.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{right behind the ear.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you're full of shit.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{jameson?}
<C>__{jameson}
<D>__{if mr. cobb said he got him, then he got him.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you have no vision, stump. a writer without vision is a waste of my time. i think i picked the wrong man.}
<A>__{cobb stumbles back into bed, somewhat exhausted by the ordeal.}
<C>__{jameson}
<D>__{and i think i better get back to san francisco before the storm hits. i will take care of these transactions, mr. cobb.}
<A>__{and jameson exits the room.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{and i will be leaving as well, sir, since you think i'm the wrong man for the job.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{shut up, stump we both know that i'm your meal ticket.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we need each other.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{and we start in the morning.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{cobb reaches over and defiantly turns up the music so that the room is overwhelmed with kreisler's violin. stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure. cobb gradually slips into sleep, buried in the music, the booze, the pills, the pain...}
