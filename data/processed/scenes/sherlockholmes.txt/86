<L>__{66a exterior second slipway continuous action}
<A>__{we see the chain extended taut as a tight rope behind the half launched ship. the ship squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle and crack with the weight of the tethered ship. a beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and... the timber finally gives way. the ship is free again, falling through the air holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the air above his head the hull screams past him with a sound like the side of the world being torn off and then the ship's away, parting the thames with a vast, frothy explosion of water. holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the river from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds. a quiet beat. holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing into his lungs. he tries to pull himself to his feet, but dredger's bone shaking punches have taken it out of him and he sags back to the ground. watson arrives, helps him to his feet. they stagger back to the slipway where dredger was standing. and they find: nothing. no blood or trace. the big man is gone. the police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene. they see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... holmes and watson. watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.}
