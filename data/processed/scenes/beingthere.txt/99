<L>__{interior tv station "this evening" studio night}
<A>__{william dupont introduces chance.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, our very distinguished quest, mr. chauncey gardiner!}
<A>__{the band plays as chance comes onto the stage. an audience of about three hundred applauds chance as he appears. two tv cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp, to center stage. dupont shakes chance's hand, chance holds dupont's hand with both of his own.}
<C>__{dupont }
<D>__{mr. gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(showing chance to chair)}
<D>__{i'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the vice president.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(also sitting)}
<D>__{i always find it surprising, mr. gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the president, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. that is surprising.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(doesn't understand)}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{yes... of course, you know, mr. gardiner, that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, i hope you don't object to that.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. i don't object.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{fine, then let's get started. the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and i would like to know if you agree with the president's view of the economy?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{which view?}
<A>__{applause and laughter from the audience. dupont accustomed to parrying with his guests, asks again.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{come now, mr. gardiner, before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand, did he not?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i was there with ben.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{i know that, mr. gardiner.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dupont}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{well, let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. do you go along with this belief?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, i know the garden very well. i have worked in it all my life. it is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. the garden needs a lot of care. i do agree with the president; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.}
<A>__{the audience applauds chance's apparent metaphor. dupont waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.}
