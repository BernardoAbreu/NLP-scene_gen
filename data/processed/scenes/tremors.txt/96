<A>__{the cb goes dead. the men stare numbly. then, drifting across the desert, a soft popping sound. the men perk up; they know what it is distant gunfire.}
<L>__{interior burt & heather's house basement day}
<A>__{the gunfire is deafening as burt and heather blast away. globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature pulls back a little. the couple keeps firing until magazines are empty. the creature lunges forward again. pan with burt and heather to reveal a wall of the basement we haven't seen until now a wall covered with guns hand guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns, military guns, elephant guns. heather grabs an hk 91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines, bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire! a hook tentacle snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet. burt pumps out eight devastating blasts from a twelve gauge riot gun, severing the tentacle. heather is on her feet in an instant. she expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full one taped upside down to it, and opens fire again. burt grabs an ar 15 semi auto and joins her. they lay down massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and smoke. ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the room. the guns are empty. the creature is still coming! they back down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after another: a lever action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun which heather fires right into the creature's mouth. shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing keeps wriggling toward them! burt and heather scramble up over a desk to keep something between them and it. burt smashes open a fancy glass case holding a huge four gauge elephant gun. he slams in two gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter. he fires. the concussion literally shakes the building. the recoil slams burt back against the wall. the monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster. great gouts of curdles blood spew from it burt hit an artery or something. the beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses, deflating like a beached whale. burt and heather stagger together and hug each other fervently. they stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror. burt suddenly shouts vehemently:}
