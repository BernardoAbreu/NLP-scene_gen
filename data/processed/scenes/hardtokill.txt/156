<L>__{interior trent mansion sporting room night}
<A>__{rain loud outside. holland, dunne, ford and jones. half tanked, shooting pool to pass the time and cool their raw nerves. no one armed.}
<C>__{dunne}
<P>__{(angry, defending himself)}
<D>__{what do we have to do, holland drive a fucking stake through his heart?}
<C>__{holland}
<D>__{i will settle for a bullet.}
<A>__{holland and dunne exchange furious glares.}
<C>__{holland}
<D>__{you had him point blank seven years ago, and he's still walking!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{he won't be for long. not with his picture on every t.v. in }
<C>__{holland}
<D>__{fuck his picture! get off your asses }
<P>__{(waves them to}
<D>__{get out of}
<P>__{here)}
<D>__{start earning your money!}
<A>__{holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair, stalks angrily toward a rear door. the others glower as holland pounds off into the rear of the house. dunne slings a cue ball the length of the table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot. the balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a futile expression of rage and frustration. suddenly:}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one holland just left by. he is dripping from the rain and has a .45 pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "shhh, don't wake the baby." dunne, ford and jones don't know whether to shit or go blind.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{how's the action, boys? mind if i play?}
<A>__{glances from the men toward the couch at the rear of the room, on which rest their jackets and shoulder holsters. storm: totally aware of every aspect of the situation.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i know what you guys are thinking. you're thinking i couldn't play with this gun in my hand. right?}
<A>__{pause as the men stand in extreme anticipation. then: storm holsters his gun.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{well? somebody hand me a cue.}
<A>__{there is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of disbelief between the boys and then, boom! ford tries to hand storm a pool cue as if storm's head is a baseball and the cue is a bat. this doesn't work very well, as storm enters and simultaneously grabs ford's cue, using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table. we hear ford's skull crack and he goes down. almost instantly another pool cue in jones's hands slashes toward storm's head. this time storm has his own tool and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head. he again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does storm's, onto the back of jones's skull with so much force we hear the neck snap at the same time the cue splinters in half! storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end. dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table. storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into dunne's midsection. with the other hand he raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down dunne's throat via the windpipe!}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{that's for my wife. fuck you and die.}
<A>__{dunne falls to his knees and just stares. storm does a flying kick to his chin, breaking his neck. the room now finished, he turns and exits.}
<B>__{indoor pool}
<A>__{holland pours himself a nervous drink. he paces, tracking trent who's doing a gentle breaststroke.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i want dunne and the others here. that goddamn storm is nuts enough to come after me }
<C>__{holland}
<D>__{he's nuts but not that nuts.}
<A>__{holland watches trent swim a few more strokes, then turns and heads away down a short hallway.}
