<D>__{i thought it would make it better. it was better. it takes some of the pressure off.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{because you can't get hard without a viagra? is it because you don't think i'm sexy?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once.}

<C>__{barb}
<D>__{i could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and i wouldn't even know that i was sitting. i could get stung by a hornet down there, and i would not feel it. you could put anything in there, and i would not know what the object was. i used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head.}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other. all the time. it's a blast.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{don't worry about it. you just gotta ride that out.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{this sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death. like her death?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i have given it a fair amount of thought.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{not in a painful way. just quietly slid into death. like a gas leak.}

<C>__{realtor }
<D>__{i know, but based on the market, it's like you're gaining money. because it's so much more than what you deserve. but these people are from iran and they don't really know that they're offering too much. is there any chance that debbie will go for it?}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so, sadie said, "that's so lame and immature that you're doing that." and then joseph says, "yo, girl. we're just having some fun so don't be a bitch, yo."}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{that is not nice.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so, then sadie said, "don't call me a bitch." and joseph said, "i didn't call you a bitch, i said don't act like a bitch. and by the way you're in the `not hot' column."}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{who made him the judge of hot?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{do you realize what that could do to her self esteem?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what a little fuckhead. i will kill him.}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how is that even possible?}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{out of three hundred million americans, six hundred and twelve people chose to download the album. you could personally call everyone who bought this record.}

<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{we heard.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you heard.}
<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{and they're bad. you know, it's that, and it's the money that he's been lending to his father, that's creating a strain.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{how much have we lent him?}
<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{eighty thousand.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{did you say "eight thousand" or "eighty thousand"?}
<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{eighty thousand, over the past couple of years. and then you missed the mortgage payment }
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{on the house?}
<C>__{accountant}
<D>__{and you missed the rental on the office.}
<C>__{debbie}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm drawing the album cover for van halen's diver down.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{if you spent a little bit more time focusing on graham parker instead of drawing album covers, i wouldn't be in this predicament.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm focused on graham parker.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you're supposed to help me with him!}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{you're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i've done everything i can, pete. you had me pushing around a corpse. it was like being in fucking weekend at graham's.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what should we do? i'm out of ideas.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you fly in the rumour. i can't sell a reunion concert without the band. it's ridiculous.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{with what? i can't afford it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you put this on yourself. you wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch.}

<D>__{pete wait. i have an apartment, i have health insurance, i have car payments. i have responsibilities.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't talk to me about responsibilities. i have a life. i have a family. i can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to tommy's chili burgers at three in the morning.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's not even the order that happens in!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i have everything to lose here. everything.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes. because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need. you really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude? which is inside? it's not even outside. we know where we work.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{if you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to cat)}

<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{i usually don't say impossible. i like to leave some wiggle room.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the indiana jones movies blocking up my uterus.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{and i need to stop using that reference of indiana jones. i think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{anyway, somehow the eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{yes. your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant.}

<C>__{debbie}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{just sell it online. do some research, make some calls. or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{all right. don't get snippy. just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw.}

"oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker." kids don't want to have old parents. you know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. kind of rediscover who we are individually. it would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that i could really just miss you. remember when we used to miss each other?}

<D>__{it's been about seven years.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{seven years? that's a joke, right? that's like two olympics. and i'm the bad guy. what debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. and it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. i'm sure oliver would agree.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{are you really doing this right now?}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't think anyone's looking for handouts... we'd pay him back.}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you know what? i would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. you know the best quality my father has? he asks for nothing. i don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. look at that. nothing. i don't even know him. and i turned out perfectly fine without his input.}
<C>__{larry}
