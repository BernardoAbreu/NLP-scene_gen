<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{in a russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and around. a simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair. around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. she reaches the top of a hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. we float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun.}
