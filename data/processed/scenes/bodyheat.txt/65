<C>__{racine}
<D>__{okay, i'm coming.}
<L>__{exterior second floor porch walker place night}
<A>__{same thick fog. the wind chimes tinkle softly. light seeps out from matty's bedroom windows, half revealing racine and matty lying together on a lounge. matty is in her white terrycloth robe, racine just shorts.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i saw the will once. he showed it to me. he was trying to prove something ... how much he loved me or something.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how'd he get so fat?}

<C>__{matty}
<D>__{the stock market, investments, real estate. he doesn't tell me anything, but i've picked up a little. i know they own a lot of land along the shore here.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{who's "they"'}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(she doesn't know)}
<D>__{he's never introduced me to anyone. i'm not sure if they're all legitimate.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(snorts at the odds of that)}
<D>__{i wonder what they call themselves. maybe i've heard of them.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{they own that old place in miranda beach, the breakers... i know that.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{the breakers? i thought hermie fisher owned that land.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{edmund mentioned it once.}
<A>__{racine lights another cigarette and gazes off into the fog, thinking. matty presses her cheek against his chest and closes her eyes tight.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{ned, it scares me to talk about these things.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you know.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{no. i don't.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{let's just not, okay? let's not think about all he's got. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(pressing)}
<D>__{what is it, matty? tell me exactly what frightens you.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i'm afraid... because when i think about it, i wish that he'd die. that's really what i want. it's horrible and ugly and it's what i most want.}
<A>__{racine looks off into the night for a few beats, then he lifts her face so he can look into her eyes.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's where we're at, isn't it, matty?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's what we're both thinking how good it'd be for us if he were gone. it'd be real sweet for us.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{don't talk about it, ned. please don't. talk is dangerous. sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{don't let it scare you. because he's not gonna die. there's nothing wrong with him, is there? there's no reason to think he's gonna die, is there?}
<A>__{matty shakes her head "no," lays it in his chest again.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's right. so we might as well forget about it, it's not gonna just happen to make things nice for us... it won't just happen.}
<A>__{racine lifts her head and kisses her on the mouth.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i'm afraid, ned.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{maybe that's a smart way to be now, matty. maybe we both should be.}
<A>__{racine takes a last drag on his cigarette and flicks it out into the fog,}
