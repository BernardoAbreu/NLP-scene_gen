<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{look for it, mrs. lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can. you may not have a great deal of time. those men know you have it just as surely as we do. you won't be safe until the money's in our hands. is that clear?}
<A>__{reggie nods. he writes something on a pad of paper and tears it off, handing it to her.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{here's where you're to call me day or night. it's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. don't lose it, mrs. lampert and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.}
