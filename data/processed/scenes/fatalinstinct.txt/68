<L>__{exterior ned's house driveway morning}
<A>__{ned turns the car key. nothing. he gets out, opens the hood. he stares... dumbfounded.}
<L>__{interior the house morning}
<A>__{ned comes in, visibly upset. lana acts surprised.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{this neighborhood is getting worse all the time! damn kids stole my engine!}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{why don't you catch the train to santa barbara? it leaves in twenty minutes.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i will just fly up.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ned looks at her strangely. she catches herself.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i mean... you can't. armed terrorists seized the airport this morning. a plane crashed into the tower... and all the runways are on fire!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah. so?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{and it's fogged in.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{dammit.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{for my peace of mind... take the train.}
<A>__{lana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i can't do it. you know how i feel about riding trains.}
<A>__{she stops... letting the blinds drop down.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{darling... it's only a short trip.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(reconsiders)}
<D>__{yeah... right. a short trip.}
<A>__{she starts to raise the blinds again. he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(he hesitates)}
<D>__{a short trip to hell in a metal tomb!}
<A>__{he slams the receiver down. lana drops the blinds again...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{just because both your parents died in a train wreck...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{and my brother, jeff...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{and your brother, morty...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{my two sisters...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{right...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{my best friend, al... my dog, woof... grandma rose... and uncle lionel. all killed by trains!}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(very convincing)}
<D>__{coincidence, ned. beside... that's the past. they're gone.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(sighs, resigned)}
<D>__{yeah. i guess i can't bring them back by not riding on a train.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{she starts to raise the blinds again...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{but i just can't get over this stupid nagging fear that...}
<A>__{she abandons the blinds, leaving them raised part way...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{fear! what about our baby, ned? i don't want to raise a child in a home filled with fear!}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. lana tugs on the cord and the blinds drop with a crash. the knocking stops. she pretends it didn't even happen, racing on.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{but if you can conquer your fear... maybe i can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father who's fearful.}
<P>__{(goes for broke)}
<D>__{ned... don't let a train kill our child before it's even conceived!}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(heaves a sigh)}
<D>__{i guess you're right.}
<A>__{she grabs the cord, then hesitates...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{you're sure now...?}
<A>__{a beat. he nods. she quickly pulls the blinds up.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{but we'll never make it to the station. by the time a cab gets here...}
<A>__{a loud knock at the front door. lana opens it. it's frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was in the neighborhood. thought i'd stop by and pick up my tools.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{frank will drive you. won't you frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure, i will take you to the train station.}
<A>__{they all freeze. lana glares at frank, who is completely unaware of his faux pas... while ned tries to figure out why that response didn't sound right.}
