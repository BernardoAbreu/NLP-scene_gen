<D>__{yeah, but they're capped!}
<A>__{the barrels of the two fourteen inchers are still capped. dead reckoning keeps rolling. riley climbs out onto one of the cannon barrels. wham! a walker grabs him by the leg from the road. riley blasts him with his .45. as other walkers approach, he shoots them with one hand, rusing the other to uncap the cannon.}

<D>__{number one is clear! i'm going for number two!}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i don't norm'lly need two shots, riley.}
<A>__{riley turns. the road is now filled with walkers. tanding astride the vehicle, riding it as if it were a living beast, riley picks some of them of with his .45.}
