<L>__{interior office dr. patel's office day}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{you seemed to have trouble last night.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{let me just set the record straight about last night. hurting my mother was a mistake and i hate myself for it, and i hate my illness and i want to control it. my father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which i did not return `cause i could've killed him and i didn't. he's sixty five years old. you don't think i could've beat the shit out of him? i mean....}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{he was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{yes, last night was a mess. okay? and i think he probably just tried to do his best.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{pat, you have to have a strategy. i told you earlier. you need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to baltimore. so when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{yeah, but that's easier said than done.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{you have to do it. you have no choice. excelsior.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{yeah, excelsior. listen, i have a letter i want you to give nikki, okay?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{because you have a restraining order.}
<C>__{pat}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<A>__{what good are you, man?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{oh, i don't know, because i'm married and i haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{maybe you think that nikki's not around and tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting nikki back to you?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{not bad, doctor jones. but i don't think i'm gonna blow it with nikki because tiffany's a slut.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{why is she a slut?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{after the dinner at ronnie's, she said, quote, "we can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." unquote. and she still wears her wedding ring. so she's a loyal, married to a dead guy slut.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{she said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can i say the same?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{can you?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{is that....? you're asking me, you're really asking me that question?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{with all my crazy sad shit? what, are you fucking nuts?}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{pat, the silver lining thing is yours. i'm just giving back your words to you. this "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no, not the books.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{you said nikki's friends with ronnie, veronica and tiffany. so if you become friends with tiffany, nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. so if you help tiffany, it will be good for you.}
