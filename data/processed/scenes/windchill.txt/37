<A>__{the interior is dark. the girl has been thrown under the dash. it's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing. finally she stirs, disoriented. she climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is. it takes her a beat to remember him. she looks over slowly. he's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel. his head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank. a link of blood trickles down the glass. dead? she's not taking any chances. without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet. suddenly he stirs, groaning. she freezes. the seconds ticking by on the dashboard clock. when he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell. finds it. then eases open the creaky passenger door. and launches herself into the frigid night.}
