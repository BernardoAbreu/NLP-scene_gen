<A>__{the container has stopped in a large subterranean space. there are numerous futuristic vehicles here hydrogen cars, three wheeled atvs, electric buses. control `bots closest to the container start to close in on the huddling prisoners. a robot bumps into bull, sending another jolt of electricity through his body, like a cattle prod. everyone gets the picture, starts hurrying down the line, the robots closing around them. cow looks around nervously, clearly freaking out. spotting a gap between the robots, she bolts a robot swivels and cuts her down with an energy blast. she lies still, smoke rising from her body. the other prisoners pick up the pace.}

<A>__{the light emanates from frosted windows at the top of the ramp, through which we make out the silhouettes of human figures. glass doors part ahead of the prisoners a stark white, sterile environment beyond. the robots stop here. the prisoners disappear inside... and the doors close.}
