<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{c 5 neff at dictaphone (night) there is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i could have hugged you right then and there, keyes, you and your statistics. you were the only one we were really scared of, and instead you were almost playing on our team...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{c 6 neff's apartment evening almost dark in the room the corridor door opens letting light in. neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. he switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, puts the key in his pocket. at this moment the telephone rings. he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{that evening when i got home my nerves had eased off. i could feel the ground under my feet again, and it looked like easy going from there on it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello... hello, baby.... sure, everything is fine... you were wonderful in norton's office.}
<A>__{c 7 interior telephone booth in a drug store phyllis is on the phone. she is not dressed as in norton's office.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i felt so funny. i wanted to look at you all the time.}
<A>__{c 8 neff on telephone in his apartment}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how do you think i felt? where are you, baby?}
<A>__{c 9 phyllis on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{at the drug store. just a block away. can i come up?}
<A>__{c 10 neff's apartment (night) neff on phone}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay. but be careful. don't let anybody see you.}
<A>__{he hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport. he looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. he gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste paper basket. the door bell rings. neff stops in sudden alarm. it can't be phyllis. the time is too short. for a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. in the open door stands keyes.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, keyes.}
<A>__{keyes walks past him into the room. his hands are clasped behind his back. there is a strange, absent minded look in his eyes. neff closes the door without taking his eyes off keyes.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<A>__{keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that broken leg. the guy broke his leg.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{talking about dietrichson. he had accident insurance, didn't he? then he broke his leg, didn't he?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{and he didn't put in a claim. why didn't he put in a claim? why?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what the dickens are you driving at?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{walter. there's something wrong. i ate dinner two hours ago. it stuck half way.}
<A>__{he prods his stomach with his thumb.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the little man is acting up again. because there's something wrong with that dietrichson case.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{because he didn't put in a claim? maybe he just didn't have time.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{oh maybe he just didn't know he was insured.}
<A>__{he has stopped in front of neff. they look at each other for a tense moment. neff hardly breathes. keyes shakes his head suddenly.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{no. that couldn't be it. you delivered the policy to him personally, didn't you, walter? and you got his check.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(stiff lipped, but}
<D>__{his voice is as well under control as he}
<P>__{can manage)}
<D>__{sure, i did.}
<A>__{keyes prods his stomach again.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{got any bicarbonate of soda?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no i haven't.}
<A>__{keyes resumes his pacing.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{listen, walter. i've been living with this little man for twenty six years. he's never failed me yet. there's got to be something wrong.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{maybe norton was right. maybe it was suicide, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{no. not suicide.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but not accident either.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{there is another longer pause, agonizing for neff. finally keyes continues:}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{look. a man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train. then, two weeks later, he is killed on a train. and not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car. do you know what the mathematical probability of that is, walter? one out of i don't know how many billions. and add to that the broken leg. it just can't be the way it looks, walter. something has been worked on us.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{such as what?}
<A>__{keyes doesn't answer. he goes on pacing up and down. finally neff can't stand the silence any longer.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{murder?}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(prods stomach again)}
<D>__{don't you have any peppermint or anything?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who do you suspect?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{maybe i like to make things easy for myself. but i always tend to suspect the beneficiary.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the wife?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yeah. that wide eyed dame that didn't know anything about anything.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you're crazy, keyes. she wasn't even on the train.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i know she wasn't, walter. i don't claim to know how it was worked, or who worked it, but i know that it was worked.}
<A>__{he crosses to the corridor door.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i've got to get to a drug store. it feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on the knob to open the door. c 11 corridor apartment house night lights on the hallway is empty except for phyllis who has been standing close to the door of neff's apartment, listening. the door has just started to open. phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. keyes is coming out.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{good night, walter.}
<A>__{neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for phyllis. suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door. he pushes the door wide so as to hide her from keyes.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good night, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{see you at the office in the morning.}
<A>__{he has reached the elevator. he pushes the call button and turns.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{but i'd like to move in on her right now, tonight, if it wasn't for norton and his stripe pants ideas about company policy. i'd have the cops after her so quick her head would spin. they'd put her through the wringer, and, brother, what they would squeeze out.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only you haven't got a single thing to go on, keyes.}
<A>__{the elevator has come up and stopped.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{not too much. twenty six years experience, all the percentage there is, and this lump of concrete in my stomach.}
<A>__{he pulls back the elevator door and turns to neff with one last glance of annoyance.}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(almost angrily)}
<D>__{no bicarbonate of soda.}
<A>__{keyes gets into the elevator. the door closes. the elevator goes down. neff stands numb, looking at the spot where keyes was last visible. without moving his eyes he pulls the door around towards him with his left hand. phyllis slowly comes out. neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment. she crosses in front of him and enters. he steps in backwards after her. c 12 interior neff's apartment phyllis has come a few steps into the room. neff, backing in after her, closes the door from inside and turns slowly. they look at each other for a long moment in complete silence.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{how much does he know?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's not what he knows. it's those stinking hunches of his.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{but he can't prove anything, can he?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not if we're careful. not if we don't see each other for a while.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{for how long a while?}
<A>__{she moves toward him but he does not respond.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{until all this dies down. you don't know keyes the way i do. once he gets his teeth into something he won't let go. he'll investigate you. he'll have you shadowed. he'll watch you every minute from now on. are you afraid, baby?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes, i'm afraid. but not of keyes. i'm afraid of us. we're not the same any more. we did it so we could be together, but instead of that it's pulling us apart. isn't it, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{and you don't really care whether we see each other or not.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{shut up, baby.}
<A>__{he pulls her close and kisses her.}
