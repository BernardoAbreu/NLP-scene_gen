<A>__{close on carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. she flips over and faces him.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{carolyn switches on the bedside light.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{you were masturbating.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i was not.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{yes, you were.}
<A>__{he turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{all right, so shoot me. i was whacking off.}
<A>__{carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. lester laughs.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{that's right. i was choking the bishop. shaving the carrot. saying hi to my monster.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{that's disgusting.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, excuse me, but i still have blood pumping through my veins!}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{so do i!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{really? i'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{lester. i refuse to live like this. this is not a marriage.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{this hasn't been a marriage for years. but you were happy as long as i kept my mouth shut. well, guess what? i've changed. and the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{oh. i see. you think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm not? well then, come on, baby! i'm ready.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{do not mess with me, mister, or i will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{on what grounds? i'm not a drunk, i don't fuck other women, i don't mistreat you, i've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. but. i did support you while you got your license. and some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.}
<A>__{she sinks into a chair, stunned. it's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. he sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. he curls up under the covers contentedly.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{turn out the light when you come to bed, okay?}
<A>__{close on lester, smiling.}
