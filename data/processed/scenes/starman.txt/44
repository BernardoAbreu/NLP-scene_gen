<A>__{jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. she looks in the bathroom. the star man isn't there. she decides to go downstairs.}
<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{the star man isn't in the living room. jenny sidles along the wall for the front door. at the archway to the den a hissing sound stops her. she peers around the molding. the spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination. the star man is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back to her. he is naked. a dot of light is hissing around his head. the shadows in the room make it difficult for jenny to tell exactly what is going on. pointing the .45 at the star man, she steps into the room for a better look. the floor creaks and the star man turns to her. jenny shudders at what she sees. the star man is holding an 8x10 color photograph of jenny and a man in his mid twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits. the dot of light is copying the man's features onto the star man's translucent head. the top two thirds of the face is already done. everything is perfect, even the eyes. jenny begins to tremble and lowers the gun.}

<D>__{no... please don't...}
<A>__{she sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned out by the flap of the approaching helicopter. the star man, with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and takes the gun from her. he drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of the helicopter now directly over the house. through the windows, we can see the searchlight scouring the hillside next to the back yard. the star man returns to the picture and resumes his transformation. he completes the chin, then continues downward weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over the entire body.}
