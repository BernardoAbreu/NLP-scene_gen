<L>__{interior chute}
<A>__{ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the top...an exterior vent hood. the sound of wind booms down from above. like blowing across a bottle top vastly amplified. ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow side ribs in the shaft. she looks down. the chute descends far into the depths, lost in shadow. she starts to climb with next behind below her, and hicks, just emerging from the side duct.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{just up there }
<A>__{newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot. she slides...catches herself with one hand. ripley reaches for her, dropping her light. the hand light goes skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend, and disappears. ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for newt's. they miss, inches apart.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{riiiiipppleee }
<A>__{she slips. hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket. and she slips out of it. with an echoing scream newt plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness. moving with her, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like a bobsled ride. the shaft pitches left. newt bounces, sliding halfway up the wall. the chute forks ahead. newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a steeper angle into the depths. just disappearing down the left shaft we see ripley's light. ripley looks hicks in the eye. and kicks free...sliding down the chute after newt. ripley slams her feet into the side ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent. ripley reaches the "v." sees the glow of the light in the left fork. she goes left.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{newt!}
<A>__{she hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it has no direction.}
<C>__{newt}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{mommy...where are you?}
<A>__{ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it intersects with a horizontal service tunnel. the light is lying there, but no newt. the echoing wail comes again.}
<C>__{newt}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{moooommeeee...}
<A>__{ripley starts down the tunnel, answering. newt's call comes again. fainter? she can't tell. she spins in a growing panic, starts the other way.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to her headset)}
<D>__{hicks, get down here. i need that locator.}
