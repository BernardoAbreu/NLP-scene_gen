<A>__{screams across the atrium, striking dead center in asher's open mouth. the bullet explodes. uv light causes asher's skull to burn up from the inside out. his headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing. then it too carbonizes and burns up. relieved, king sinks to his knees. behind king, we see zoe slip from the alcove. she makes for the stairs.}
