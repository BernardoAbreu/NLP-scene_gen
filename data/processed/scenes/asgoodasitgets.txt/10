<L>__{interior carol's restaurant day}
<B>__{angle on waitress}
<A>__{carol connelly talks with another mother a customer. you would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be the most carefree time of the day. she is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to the mother's little girl)}
<D>__{look at you, you're all better.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it's that new medication.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you know all my son's stuff, right?}
<A>__{the mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but carol interrupts her.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{no, no, no, i got a date tonight. i'm walking out the door this morning and he says to me, 'mom, i promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date.'}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{isn't that sweet.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{little blonde angle.}
<P>__{(to child, affectionately)}
<D>__{eat everything.}
<A>__{melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a man and woman sitting at the table.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it just came out of me. i said you love me the way a remote control loves a tv. as long as i switch every time...}
<C>__{her male companion}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{people who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch.}
<P>__{(on their look)}
<D>__{eat up.}
<A>__{they turn away melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses, lisa and carol, are talking.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{pay me back next week.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i owe you. i told you today... them's the rules. oh, excuse me, melvin.}
<A>__{she puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way. he gulps at the contact (since no one else ever touches him) but covers his self consciousness.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm starving.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(firmly to lisa)}
<D>__{will you please take it?}
<A>__{melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{this way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready for the date.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{"ready" is not my problem.}
<A>__{she barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. if we could read melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. to carol he is as harmless as furniture.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to melvin)}
<D>__{go sit down. you know you're not allowed back here... spencer's more excited about it than i am... he says, "mom, i promise not to get a fever or couch during your date."}
<A>__{the other waitresses and the short order cook all go "awww."}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i know. he's just the best.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i've got jews at my table.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{it's not your table. it's the place's table. behave. this once, you can sit at someone else's station.}
<A>__{the two waitresses signal their protests.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{or you can just wait your turn...}
<A>__{melvin walks back into the restaurant proper... he hangs near their table... his discomfort builds in this limbo... then:}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{how much more you got to eat? your appetite isn't as big as your noses, is it?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what?!!}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{let's go }
<A>__{the woman starts to protest.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{let's leave. we're going.}
<A>__{melvin sits down at the table and takes from his pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. as he opens his utensils.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming you ever act like this again you're barred for life. i'm gonna miss the excitement, but i will handle it.}
<A>__{there is in carol's attitude toward melvin some ingredient of self satisfaction that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. she starts to clear the table.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{the table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{we're all gonna die soon. i will. you will. it sure sounds like your son will.}
<B>__{on carol}
<A>__{stunned. some crazy street freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. melvin senses that he's gone way too far. he wipes his knife.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{if you ever mention my son again, you will never be able to eat here again. do you understand? give me some sign you understand or leave now. do you understand me...}
<P>__{(adds truthful label)}
<D>__{you crazy freak? do you?!?}
<A>__{a beat and then melvin nods, hardly breathing backing down.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{okay. i will get your order.}
<A>__{she walks away. melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. he takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.}
