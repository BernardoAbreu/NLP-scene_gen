<L>__{exterior mall roof antenna night}
<A>__{chris dodges a spider's webline. several more come at him.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you're going down!}
<A>__{chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight. the antenna keels over. chris hangs tight as he drops toward the glass.}
<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{sam looks up to see chris come crashing down through the skylight on the antenna. the antenna tilts in at a sixty degree angle. chris hangs off the end. orb weavers ride their weblines down to the floor of the mall. mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. he sees a hundred spiders coming in on webs. flooding out of the stores. the devil spawned monsters are everywhere!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{arac attack!}
<A>__{chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. he slides down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the bottom. sam runs to his side.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did you get help?! is anybody coming!?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{we're on our own!}
<A>__{sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym. the waitress roller skates away from the spiders. she slaloms clear of several spitters. but gets tackled by a jumper.}
