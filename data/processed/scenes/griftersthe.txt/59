<A>__{lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth chattering. her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of the right hand developing a large red burn.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{lucky! lucky! oh, am i lucky.! am i lucky!}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the surface result is, he's mad at lilly.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{lucky? you call that lucky?}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{he let me live. he let me be his friend.}
<A>__{roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the wheelchair, bumping into things.}

<D>__{you don't put up with that! nobody has to put up with that!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you do if you're where i am. where you want to be. how'd you get that punch in the stomach, roy?}

<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lilly }
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{you don't have the stomach for it.}
<A>__{he stares at her, hurt and angry. she stares back, unflinching. angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his back to her. now she's hurt. she shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i just give you your life. what you do with it is up to you.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(his back turned)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{she hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door. hearing the door close, roy spins around in the wheelchair to face where she'd been. he starts to get up, pauses midway.}
