<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. the office twenty minutes later}
<A>__{we look down on the bookkeeping department. all the desks are occupied but two. there are six women and our three men. the office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent over his desk. there is the occasional punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing. our three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, and ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate something on the adding machine. after a moment, walter says:}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(without looking up from his work)}
<D>__{you fellows going to arnold's party tonight?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{no, i'm not going, are you?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no. eddie already hooked me for four bucks for arnold's present. this dinner is going to cost another couple of good dollars.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it looks like nobody's going to arnold's bachelor party.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you ain't going?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i'm not going.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{eddie's going to be mad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i told eddie last week i couldn't make it. i've got school. eddie's a bachelor. it's all right for him to go rooting around town, picking up girls.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, you get married you give that kind of thing up.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, charlie says eddie has a whole bunch of chorus girls lined up for us tonight.}
<A>__{walter's head comes up for the first time.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i just said that if i knew eddie, we'd probably wind up with some of his crazy girl friends.}
<A>__{walter looks back down to his work again.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i don't know where he gets all these girls. he's a screwy looking jerk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{did you see that blonde who was up here looking for him last week?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah. he told me she was a television actress. i think i saw her once on "studio one." she was in a coal mine with some stir crazy coalminer who was trying to strangle her with a necktie.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'd like to strangle her with a necktie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{now, walter, an old married man like you, with asthma and everything.}
<A>__{walter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of pain crossing his face.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i get real jealous of eddie sometimes. he's as free as a bird. did you see that convertible he's got?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, he really banged it up i hear.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you ought to see the old heap i've got. he walks out of here on payday, he can spend the whole works on having himself a good time. i walk out of here, and i got three kids and a wife, all of them with their palms out. i lost two bucks playing poker at my house last week. it was an economic catastrophe. my wife didn't sleep all night.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's late again.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he'll be twenty minutes late again. if flaherty walked in now, he'd fire him. if that ever happened to me, i think i'd kill myself. what does eddie care? so he scrambles around for another job. flaherty told me last week i had too many days off. i told him i was sick in bed. what do you want me to do?}
<A>__{he turns back again to his work, his face creased with anxiety. the three men work silently for a moment. then the office door opens, and a man of about thirty five, a little stout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel rimmed glasses, enters. this is eddie watkins, the office bachelor. he seems to have had very little sleep the night before. his eyes, behind the wire rimmed glasses, are heavy lidded. a cigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth. there is something of the bacchanalian libertine about eddie. there is a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, establishing that this is eddie. he shuffles with ineffable weariness to his desk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hi, eddie, you're early today, only twenty minutes late, what happened?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(muttering through reluctant lips)}
<D>__{flaherty come in yet?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{eddie sits down at his desk, pulls his cigarette automatically for a moment. then he reaches over to a pile of telephone directories on the floor beside his desk, pulls up the manhattan one, flips through the pages, finding the number he wants. he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{mary, give me an outside line....}
<P>__{(he pauses, checks}
<D>__{the number in the phone book again,}
<P>__{dials, waits)}
<D>__{hello, is this leathercraft on madison avenue? ... this is mr. watkins. i was in about a week ago. i ordered a military set and a wallet. they were supposed to be ready yesterday.... yes, please, would you? ...}
<P>__{(he is searching}
<D>__{his pockets while he waits, finds a piece of paper,}
<P>__{pulls it out)}
<D>__{yeah, a military set and a wallet....}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{is that what we bought poor arnold?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{that's right. the following inscriptions should be on them:}
<P>__{(reads from the paper)}
<D>__{on the military set: "to arnold: best wishes on your marriage from alice, charlie, eddie, evelyn, jeanette with two t's, kenneth, lucy, mary, olga, walter, and flaherty." now on the wallet ... yeah, what? .... yeah, that's right flaherty. now, on the wallet, the following inscription: "to my best friend arnold from his best man eddie." ... no, to my best friend arnold. ... that's right. "from his best man eddie" ... now, can i come in at lunch and pick them up? ...}
<A>__{a young woman comes into the office, goes to walter's desk and drops some papers before him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's this, jeanette?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's from finance, don't ask me.}
<A>__{this is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler three times a morning and all the men covertly watch her. she is cute, but attractive more by comparison to the other women in the office. nevertheless, all the men, including eddie and charlie, let their eyes cautiously watch her as she leaves, her sheath dress tight on her hips. eddie, who has hung up, now rubs his eyes with two fingers to clear his head and picks up the phone again.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{mary, give me the hotel westmore. circle 7 0598.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(hands kennie paper)}
<D>__{this isn't for me it's for you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{now who owes me on the presents? charlie, you owe me?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i gave you four bucks yesterday....}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i owe you, eddie. i will pay you tomorrow, payday.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{miss frances kelley, please. i think it's room 417....}
<A>__{the three heads around him look slowly up from their respective work, naked interest manifest on their faces.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(calling to one}
<D>__{of the women in}
<P>__{the office)}
<D>__{hey, evelyn, you owe me four bucks.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{all right. i know.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello, frances, this is eddie.... all right, wait a minute. give me a chance to explain.... i know i woke you up.... all right, let me tell you. you know i'm supposed to be the best man at this fellow arnold's wedding. so i called him up last night because i didn't know whether i was supposed to wear tuxedo or tails. well, he didn't know either, so he said: "come on over to my girl's house with me tonight. they're making all the arrangements for the wedding now." so i called you and left a message at the desk saying i couldn't get over till about ten o'clock.... all right! that's what i'm going to explain! ... thank you.}
<P>__{(holds receiver}
<D>__{against his chest and looks at his colleagues with air of a man being tried just a little too much. returns receiver to his ear,}
<P>__{listens for a moment)}
<D>__{all right, so i had to go over to arnold's girl's house with arnold last night. well, there was about thirty people there, and, man, you never saw such a crazy mess. there was this little bald headed guy there. he's the bride's uncle. he's come all the way down from boston with his whole family to go to the wedding. the only trouble was, he wasn't invited. well, this crazy uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he starts shaking me by the lapels. so i said: "what do you want from me? i ain't the groom! i'm just trying to find out whether i'm supposed to wear tuxedo or tails."}
<P>__{(apparently this got}
<D>__{a laugh. eddie breaks}
<P>__{into a smile)}
<D>__{funny, huh? ... look, frances. i have to go to work now. i'm calling you from the office. how about letting me make this up to you? i will take you out to dinner saturday night.... i can't make it tonight. the bachelor party's tonight.... all right, saturday night.... it's a date.... s'help me.... i swear, right on time. eight thirty, okay? ... okay, we'll have a ball. goodbye, go back to sleep.}
<A>__{he hangs up. the three married men look down again to their ledgers and tap away again on their adding machines. eddie sits slumped in his seat for a moment.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what did i just tell that girl, saturday night?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(picks up phone)}
<D>__{mary, give me columbus 5 1098.... what do you mean personal calls! these are business calls! well, stop listening to other people's conversations.... what have you got, stock in the company? columbus 5 1098.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{listen, eddie, i don't think i can go tonight. my father in law's in from akron, ohio, and }
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(all sweetness)}
<D>__{hello, who is this, mrs. stebbins? ... this is eddie, mrs. stebbins. i wonder if i can talk to muriel.... could i speak to her? ... thank you....}
<A>__{the three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy on each face.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, i can't make it saturday night.... i'm all loused up with this wedding i'm supposed to be the best man at.... we have to rehearse the ceremony. you'd think they were getting married on television.... yes, sweetie, why don't i call you monday. maybe, we'll work out something before you go back to california.... all right, sweetie, good bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the cigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and turns to the others.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, what do you say? i'm going to call louie and make a reservation for a table for tonight. who's coming and who isn't? walter, you're coming, right? it won't cost you more than three fifty for the whole meal. what do you say, walter? you only live once.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(strangely sad)}
<D>__{that's right. you only live once.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, yes or no?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{all right, i will come.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{kennie?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, i will get out of the house for a change.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how about you, charlie?}
<A>__{charlie is frowning down at a sheaf of adding machine totals in front of him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't think so, eddie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{ah, come on, charlie, you got to bust loose every now and then. we'll have a couple of drinks.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(picks up phone)}
<D>__{mary, give me an outside line and don't give me no trouble.... chickering 4 5099.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{come on, charlie, it's a short life, believe me.}
<A>__{move in for closeup of charlie, frowning. over this, eddie's voice.}
<C>__{eddie's voice}
<D>__{hello, hello, louie? is this louie? ... louie, this is eddie watkins. i'd like to reserve a table for four for tonight.... for four ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, eddie ...}
<C>__{eddie's voice}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{count me in.}
<A>__{he immediately bends back to his work, takes his pencil up again. camera pulls quickly up and away until we have an angle shot looking down at their desks in various positions of work.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{louie, make that five.... five guys ... yeah, a bachelor party ...}
