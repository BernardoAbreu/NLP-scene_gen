<A>__{a shooter: black hood, black t shirt, old school red white black air jordans, snub stock ak, an open, filthy north face backpack at his feet holding spare clips, god knows what else. shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge, firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting a fire cracker. we see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of blindly fired shells pop the asphalt inches from fleury's head, soiling his face in black top debris. but fleury never stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on reflex. air jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates: fleury's three feet away with the riot gun. another rack and blast to make sure a.j. stays down for eternity. fleury spots and bull charges a second shooter: ballistic chicken, fleury wins. a sound... fleury spins, racking the riot gun, aims and freezes: 2 six year old boys stare from the doorway.}
