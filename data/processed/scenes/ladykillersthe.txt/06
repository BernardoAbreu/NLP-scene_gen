<A>__{mrs. munson hand cranks a can opener around a tin of cat food.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{mm... gizzards...}
<A>__{the cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover comes off the can. the can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish.}
<L>__{interior munson house living room night}
<A>__{above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious looking black man of late middle age with a neatly groomed mustache starting to gray. a couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine. mrs. munson enters and lights the candles.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{othar, i went'n complained about weemack, i hope it'll do some good. that boy hangin' by a thread! over the pit! fiery pit! "i left my wallet in el segundo"!}
<A>__{she shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting. as she sits she gives an audible groan.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...sixty seven years of life, forty six years of marriage, you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles? it's the human condition, most humans anyway. like that ball player said: world's got two kinds of folks them that's got piles and them that's gonna get 'em. but you was always healthy as an ox...}
<A>__{there is the distant moan of a riverboat horn.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...passed on before you got piles. mmmmhmm. thank the lord you wasn't sick. you don't wanna sicken 'n die. no, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful... go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land... woof...}
<A>__{a gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the portrait flicker. as mrs. munson looks around the room, vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the cat arches its back and hisses. at this moment the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...well who's that now, pickles?}
<A>__{she grunts as she hoists herself out of the chair. i e. munson house foyer night she opens the door a draft }
