<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior level one, the plains day}
<A>__{alex slams into the ground, splashing up water and smoke alike. we are inside arcade now, experiencing what alex experiences. the plains in many respects it looks like earth. land, water, sky... yet certain things are off. small things, like the color of light, a sluggish smoke filled red, or the occasional flicker of lightning which races beneath the cloud cover above.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{pulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face. she coughs, totally disoriented. looks around. looks at herself. she's wearing...}
<B>__{battle gear}
<A>__{this is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw nick wearing when he played the game before. it's a cross between a skateboarder's protective guardpads and full blown armor. a helmet rests on her head, with a visor raised up. alex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her. (note: depending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjust itself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board). on alex's right cyberglove is an led display. in the upper left hand corner it says "level one". to the right, two pulsing bars of light labeled "time elapsed" and "strength". at this very moment, the "time elapsed" bar is just shrinking away to nothing. blink! now it's gone. no rest for the weary. a shriek sonic boom is immediately heard on the horizon, and it's the most god awful noise we've ever heard. it fills up the world.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{jerks her head up, terrified.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to herself, remembering)}
<D>__{screamer.}
<A>__{all around her, the world begins to vibrate...}
<B>__{something}
<A>__{is rushing towards her now at an unbelievable speed. the shriek sonic boom is deafening. the world is shaking apart. and suddenly the thing is upon her! alex screams.}
