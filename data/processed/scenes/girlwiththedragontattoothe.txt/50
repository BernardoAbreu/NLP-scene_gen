<A>__{erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks, comes through the empty offices with a wayne's coffee to go cup but blomkvist is already there, packing supplies from his desk, books from his shelf. a second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.}
<D>__{erika v o you can't be serious }
<L>__{int exterior millennium's offices early morning later}
<A>__{he zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and gathers the rest.}

<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you fired me; i need something to do.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{you fired you; i need you here, not the north pole. you know what this is going to look like.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{like i've been gutted. like i'm running away. i am.}
<A>__{they cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. and the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{there is a problem between us. he won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone.}
<A>__{he kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue and steps outside.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's four hours by train. it's not the north pole.}
