<L>__{interior high school library day}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{moves down the aisles of books, dwarfed by shelves which reach clear to the ceiling. she looks a little haggard, like she hasn't had any sleep. she turns...}
<B>__{nick and stilts}
<A>__{are sitting at a study cubicle. nick looks equally tired, but stilts is jawing away. as alex joins them, nick looks up.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well? where are the others?}
<A>__{nick shrugs, looking elsewhere.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{sick?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{everybody's sick, huh?}
<P>__{(glances at watch)}
<D>__{it's fifteen after. we always meet here, you know that.}
<C>__{stilts}
<P>__{(to nick)}
<D>__{what's her problem?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{did you play arcade last night?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{actually, no. i was just telling nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...}
<A>__{alex nods, glaring at nick. his reluctance to believe her is understandable, but the events unfolding are scaring him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you want to hear something else, nick? i tried to call them this morning...greg, benz, laurie... their phones are out of order.}
<A>__{alex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and then i started thinking...about everyone else that was at dante's yesterday. i drew up this list. deloach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too.}
<A>__{stilts starts humming the twilight zone theme.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{so what do you want me to do?}
<A>__{alex softens, then reaches for nick's hand.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we have to find out what's happened to them. i think they're gone...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{if they're sick, great. but let's make sure.}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{come on, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay. we'll see what's up. but if things are cool, i don't want to hear anything more about this. life's too short, know what i mean?}
<A>__{nick and alex rise.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{so you guys are cutting school? lemme go with you.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just stay here, stilts.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{and don't watch any television.}
<A>__{stilts thinks nick and alex are involved in some sort of joke, but he's playing along, grinning.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{oh, okay. forget twilight zone, now we're talking outer limits here. we control your horizontal, your vertical...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just do what she says, stilts. and if we're not back...}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{i will call the national guard. i got it under control.}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{oh, just one more thing. is it a supernatural thing you guys are going off to fight, or is it aliens, like pod people and stuff like that? cause there's a difference, you know. one you need garlic and silver bullets for, the other...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{look at me, stilts. am i laughing?}
<A>__{the grins fades from stilts' face. nick is definitely not laughing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just do what she said. don't watch television.}
<A>__{nick spins around and takes alex by the arm, leading her away.}
