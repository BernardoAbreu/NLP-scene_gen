<D>__{the lord's blessing on you, kind sir. these sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks of st. catherine's.}
<A>__{he indicates his cargo of barrels.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it appears to me, reverend friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person.}
<A>__{ignoring him, the friar mounts the cart.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{a thousand pardons, sir, but duty beckons. i must hasten on.}

<A>__{robin staggers. the friar whips up the horse. dazed, robin grabs for the fat man's leg. gets a holy sandal full in the face.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{giddyup, nag!}
<A>__{the friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises his head from the grass and ambles forward. robin runs after them and dives at the friar, toppling him from the cart.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you leave when i say.}
<A>__{scrambling to his feet, the friar glances skyward.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{protect me, lord.}
<A>__{he sweeps his foot, knocking robin's legs out from under him. hurls his full body weight on top of him. whooomf!}
<C>__{friar}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{well, friar tuck. we have need of an honest man of god, to minister to these men and their families. what do you say?}
