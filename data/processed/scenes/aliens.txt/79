<A>__{hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly. they turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth. ripley hangs back. then realizes there is nothing behind her but darkness. she catches up to the group.}
<L>__{interior kitchens}
<A>__{the troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the stainless steel surfaces.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{it's moving.}
<A>__{vasquez is scanning, gaze intense. the other troops grip their weapons tightly.}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{which way?}
<A>__{hicks nods toward a complicated array of food processing equipment. they move forward, weapons leveled. ripley shuffles forward in the dark. wierzbowski trips over a metal cannister, sending it clanging. ripley half climbs the wall. hicks' tracker beeps steadily. the beeps merge. become a solid tone. crash. something moves in the dark, toppling a rack of stockpots. on vasquez pivoting smoothly to fire. in the same instant hicks' rifle slashes into frame. slams vasquez' barrel upward. a stream of tracer fire rips into the ceiling, the rounds searing like lightning.}

<D>__{you fuck!}
<A>__{hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light under a row of steel cabinets. he gestures to ripley, who steps forward. trusting his judgment. she crouches beside him. ripley's p.o.v. lit by hicks' pack light...a tiny cowering figure. a very dirty, very terrified newt jorden. she clutches a plastic food packet in one hand, its top gnawed partway through. in the other hand she grips the head of a large doll, holding it by the hair. just the head. eyes staring. newt is pathetically emaciated...fragile looking as dresden china, her hair tangled and matted.}

<D>__{come on out. it's all right...}
<A>__{ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the cabinet. newt backs away, trembling visibly, her vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights. ripley's hand almost reaches her. the kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the cabinetry. ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her in sight. crabbing frantically sideways. hicks makes a grab, catching one tiny ankle. he snaps his hand out a moment later.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{ow! shit. watchit, she bites.}
<A>__{the girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the baseboard, its grille kicked out. she scrambles inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like a fish. in his bulky armor hicks knows he'll never make it into the tiny duct. ripley dives. she squirms into the duct without thinking. just ahead she sees newt enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch. ripley pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it, and crawls in after her. newt is backed into a cul de sac in the tiny steel chamber. ripley shines her light around in amazement. it is a nest. a nest built by a child. wadded up blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a haphazard array of toys, stuffed animals, dolls, cheap jewelry, comic books, empty food packets, even a battery operated tape player. all foraged from the wrecked colony. ripley marvels at the child's incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even in this nightmarish environment. newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch. ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug. the kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets. eyes wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent. no scream.}

<A>__{newt goes limp, almost catatonic. close on newt's traumatized, vacant stare her lips are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and she flinches from unseen terrors. we read a dark nightmare world in her eyes. ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris... a framed photograph of newt, dressed up and smiling, a ribbon in her hair. in embossed gold letters underneath it says:}
