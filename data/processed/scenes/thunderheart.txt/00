<A>__{something is rising from the black hills. a sphere of light, too red to be the sun. a sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. to the drum. it is the sun. but it is a paha sapa sunrise. a black hills sunrise. and it is spectacular. the drum, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. stronger. igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the indians say, an old man dancing. the grass is golden. and high. the wind moves through it, snakes through it. slowly.}

<A>__{voices; a traditional indian song (lakota), summoning wakan tanka the great mystery. and now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. shoulders. a man, running in ghostly slow motion, his long black hair trailing in the wind. the indian man wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck. legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. running... his heart pounding. song rising... drum pounding... five more voices in high pitched tremolo join the song. and then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by live speed, revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the indian into the air, throwing him. slamming him hard into the grass. and it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead. lakota song ends abruptly. long shot the great plains the sun burns like lava at the horizon. drum beats like a heart. and somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an owl. then silence. deep, disturbing stillness.}
