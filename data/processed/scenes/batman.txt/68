<A>__{it looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. at a long table sit gotham's most distinguished criminals: ganglords and rackets bosses from every corner of the city. they stare suspiciously at the head of the table.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{so that's how it is, gents. until grissom decides it's safe to come up for air... i'm running the show.}
<A>__{now we see what they see: the joker, dressed rather flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. his face is layered with flesh toned makeup, and his hair's been rinsed black. unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish smile.}
<C>__{gang boss}
<D>__{so why don't we hear this from grissom?}
<C>__{racketeer}
<D>__{i got something i'd like to know. how come you're wearing that stupid smirk?}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{'cause i got an army, chum. and i got grissom's army. and this city is mine.}
<A>__{carmine rotelli, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:}
<C>__{rotelli}
<D>__{i don't like taking orders, from grissom. and i especially don't like taking orders from grissom's goon.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{i've considered that possibility.}
<C>__{rotelli}
<D>__{and what happens if we say no?}
<C>__{joker}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{nobody wants a war, carmine. if we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.}
<C>__{rotelli}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{the joker extends a hand. rotelli reaches out to shake it. he doesn't see the joy buzzer concealed in the joker's palm.}
