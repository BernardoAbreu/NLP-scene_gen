<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<B>__{bathing beauty}
<A>__{with the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up. we pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running board of the 1939 ford roadster.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{sitting at the desk, staring at the picture. from his glazed eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has been staring at the picture for some time. he notices something on the desk and picks it up.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the holy bible placed by the gideons. barton opens it, randomly, to the book of daniel. the text is set in ornately gothic type. "5. and the king, nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the chaldeans, i recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{staring at the passage. his mouth hangs open.}
<B>__{the bible}
<A>__{barton riffles to the first page. in bold type at the top: "the book of genesis" underneath, in the same ornately gothic type: "chapter one 1. fade in on a tenement building on manhattan's lower east side. faint traffic noise is audible; 2. as is the cry of fishmongers."}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes. his mouth hangs open. barton's room day at the cut the harsh clackety clack of typing bangs in. sunlight burns against the sheers of barton's window, making it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains fairly dim. barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously. he finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places it face down on a short stack of face down pages. he feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. he is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we left him the previous night. the telephone rings. after several rings barton stops typing and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. his voice is hoarse.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{hello... chet... who?...}
<A>__{he puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the typewriter, and examines something he has just written. he picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{... no, don't send them up here. i will be right down.}
<B>__{elevator}
<A>__{a small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator. we pan down to barton, who is riding down with pete, the old elevator operator. barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...you read the bible, pete?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{holy bible?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i think so... anyway, i've heard about it.}
<A>__{barton nods. they ride for a beat.}
<B>__{lobby}
<A>__{late afternoon sun slants in from one side. the lobby has the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it. barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, from which two men in suits are rising. one is tall, the other short.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{fink?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah. policeman #2 detective mastrionotti. policeman #1 detective deutsch.}
<C>__{mastrionotti}
<D>__{l.a.p.d.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{all three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. mastrionotti perches on the edge of his chair; deutsch slumps back in the shadows, studying barton.}
<C>__{deutsch}
<D>__{got a couple questions to ask ya.}
<C>__{mastrionotti}
<D>__{what do you do, fink?}
<A>__{still hoarse:}

<C>__{mastrionotti}
<D>__{...give me a call if you see him. or if you remember something that isn't totally idiotic.}
<A>__{barton's room we are tracking toward the paper wrapped parcel that sits on the nightstand next to barton's bed. barton enters and picks it up. he holds it for a beat, looking at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits. he shakes it. no sound; whatever is inside is well packed. barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf. finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.}
