<D>__{hey, man, that was righteous, but i need a shot with the sign up.}
<A>__{at the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, fuzzy, moves to hang a greenpeace sign. mean green strokes the cave wall.}

<A>__{chomp! a set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into fuzzy's skull. blood splatters on the hippies. bearded cameraman jumps to pull fuzzy from the breach. fuzzy's body is yanked into the hole. the group tumbles forward. mean green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't. one by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death. ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls. bearded cameraman stumbles back. mean green spots him.}
<C>__{mean green}
<D>__{give me the keys!!!}
<A>__{bearded camerman just stares at her in shock. he's missing both his arms. mean green lunges and grabs chief's dropped pick axe. she hammers at the chain around her waist. foot by foot, she's dragged closer. at the last second, she breaks the chain, popping herself free. she spins, running for safety. a guttural howl behind her fills the cavern. mean green sprints toward the cave opening. she's gonna make it. only a few more feet. and then... jerk! something grabs her neck and yanks her back into the darkness. the whiplash sends her bloody bullhorn flying into the light. as it lands, it lets out one last weak honk...}
