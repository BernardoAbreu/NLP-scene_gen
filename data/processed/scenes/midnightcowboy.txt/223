<D>__{listen, i gotta have money.}
<C>__{towny}
<D>__{oh. yes. of course. i should have thought. you shouldn't have to ask. that was thoughtless of me. yes. wait here...}
<A>__{towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. beside the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman wearing a hearing aid. towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns terrified to see joe close behind him almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. pressed against the table, protecting but calling attention to his wallet, towny holds out the bill.}
<C>__{towny }
<D>__{here. don't even thank me.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(takes the bill)}
<D>__{i gotta have more'n ten. i gotta have fifty seven dollars.}
<C>__{towny}
<D>__{i simply don't have it, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{get outta my way.}
<C>__{towny}
<D>__{you're wasting your time. there's nothing in there.}
<A>__{towny clutches the table, staring at joe, shaking his head like a bad little boy. joe backhands him angrily. trying to duck the blow, towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but grabs the table in his arms, watching joe out of the corner of his eyes, whimpering. joe grabs his hair, turning his face up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{let go. let go of the table.}
<A>__{joe slaps him, but towny clings more fiercely to the table as joe tries to jerk it free. joe strikes him with his fist.}
<C>__{towny}
<D>__{i deserved that, i know i did.}
<A>__{but he clutches the table wildly. his mother's picture falls unnoticed. joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill the role towny has assigned him.}
<C>__{towny }
<D>__{i brought this on myself. i'm bleeding, my nose is bleeding, isn't it?}
<A>__{towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood trickling from his nose. suddenly joe jerks the lamp free of its socket.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you wanna gimme fifty seven dollars or you wanna busted skull?}
<A>__{towny simply stares at the lamp.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{please let go of that table.}
<A>__{joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of hitting towny. towny shrieks eyes rolling back as he falls limp loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed, laughing and crying hysterically. joe has to step over him to reach the wallet in the drawer. he takes all the money probably twice what he needs desperate to get out of the room.}
