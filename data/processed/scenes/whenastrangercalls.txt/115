<L>__{interior bell tower}
<A>__{duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. he has no choice but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of clifford's angry footsteps always coming up behind him. finally, duncan can climb no higher. he is at the top of the bell tower. a lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. above him are the huge iron bells. a rope hangs down from the bells, dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to the floor of the church. clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. duncan has little choice. he is trapped. just before clifford reaches him, duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the bell rope. the bell starts to clang as duncan, hanging in mid air, swings back and forth within the narrow shaft. clifford leans way out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at duncan, but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing down the rope. clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. at last, he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get duncan to lose his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below. but duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. the bell continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. then clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins to haul up on the rope. clifford gains momentum until duncan is being pulled up faster than he is climbing down. still twenty feet off the ground, duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone floor. then people come rushing into the church, awakened by the commotion of the bells. duncan rolls into the shadows and drags himself out a side door, while clifford plans his own escape from the bell tower.}
