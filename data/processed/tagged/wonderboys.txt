<D>__{you're not like my other students, james. so what was the movie you two saw?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{huh? oh. son or fury. with tyrone power and frances farmer.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she went crazy, frances farmer.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{so did gene tierney. she's in it too.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sounds like a good one.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(a crooked smile)}
<D>__{it's not bad.}
<A>__{grady considers james' fragile face.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{listen, james, about this afternoon. in workshop. i'm sorry. i think i let things get a bit out of control.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{they really hated it. i think they hated it more than any of the other ones.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. it only took me an hour to write.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(truly impressed)}
<D>__{really? that's remarkable.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i have trouble sleeping. while i'm lying in bed i figure them out. the stories.}
<A>__{as james gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, grady looks down at the left front pocket of james' overcoat. like a nervous tic, james' hand hidden twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you cold, james?}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so what are you doing out here?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's colder in there. }
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{james blinks, startled by grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny. he looks back to the greenhouse}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{actually, i saw the greenhouse. so i thought ...i thought i'd come out here and take a look at it. you don't see one of those every day. it looks like heaven...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{heaven?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i saw a movie once. part of it took place in heaven. everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. like that. at least that's the way i remember it...}
<A>__{abruptly, james glances at his watch.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i should be going.}
<A>__{james turns away, then stops. he stands like this a moment, then turns back. holds out his right hand.}
<C>__{james leer }
<D>__{goodbye, professor tripp.}
<A>__{grady hesitates, then shakes james' hand. james moves off then, leaving the light of the house behind.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james.}
<P>__{(as he stops)}
<D>__{don't leave just yet. there's something i think you ought to see.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i will miss my bus.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{this is worth it.}
<A>__{james looks conflicted.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{trust me.}
<L>__{interior living room moments later}
<A>__{it's quieter now, the party winding down, as grady sneaks james past the departing guests and toward the stairs.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{hey, you two.}
<A>__{grady stops, sees hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.}
<C>__{hannah green }
<D>__{are you riding with me, james?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no, i'm going ho }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he's going with me. you take crabtree. and his friend. all right?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{ail right. by the way, his friend...?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{the answer's yes. i think. yes. i don't know. where are they exactly?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{here we are!}
<A>__{crabtree appears at the top of the landing with miss sloviak. her lipstick is blurry.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<P>__{(spying james)}
<D>__{nell, hello there.}
<A>__{crabtree steps down the stairs, hand extended. james leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james. this is my editor, terry crabtree.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{james'll know about george sanders.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{george sanders?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{pills. august 25, 1972. in a costa brava hotel room.}
<A>__{the few people within earshot glance oddly at james, but crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{how comprehensive of you.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{oh, james is amazing. he knows all the movie suicides. go ahead, james. tell them who else.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{there's so many...}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{just a few then. the big ones.}
<A>__{james glances at the loose group of people around him, watching, then...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{pier angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. charles boyer, 1978, pills again. charles butterworth, 1946, i think. in a car. supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . .}
<P>__{(a trace of irony)}
<D>__{he was distraught. dorothy dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. albert dekker, 1968, he hung himself. he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. alan ladd, '64, more pills, carole landis, pills again, i forget when. george reeves, superman on tv, shot himself. jean seberg pills of course, 1979. everett sioane he was good pills. margaret sullavan, pills, lupe velez, a lot of pills. gig young. he shot himself and his wife in 1978. there are more but i don't know if you would have heard of them. ross alexander? clara blandick? maggie mcnamara? gia scaia?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i haven't heard of half of those.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you did them alphabetically.}
<A>__{james turns, finds crabtree's laser eyes on him. james blinks, as if he had forgotten about crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's just how my brain works, i guess.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{fascinating. listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{actually. ..i just want to go home.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{oh, don't be silly. no one your age just wants to go home. besides, faculty will be present. just think of it as a field trip.}
<A>__{as he exits, crabtree raises an eyebrow to grady, as if to say: "bring him." miss sloviak follows, eyeing james glacially as we cut to:}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{the dull purr of a combination lock is heard, a door opens, and a triangle of light falls on a photograph of marilyn monroes joe dimaggio on their wedding day.}
<L>__{interior closet gaskell house}
<A>__{grady and james leer stand in the doorway. just below the photograph of marilyn and joe hanging next to a pin striped jersey bearing the number 5 is a short black satin jacket trimmed with an ermine collar.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{is that really it?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that's really it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{the one she wore on her wedding day?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so i'm told.}
<A>__{james, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments, stands speechless.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{james swallows, then' goes to the jacket. carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{they're glass. the buttons.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{like the lady herself.}
<A>__{grady says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a bit, but james nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the jacket, as if marilyn herself were inside it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{she was small. most people don't know that. the shoulders are small.}
<P>__{(touching the satin)}
<D>__{it looks so perfect. i bet it's the only time she wore it. that day. she must've felt so ...happy.}
<A>__{grady studies james as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must've cost dr. gaskell a lot.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're really good friends with the chancellor, aren't you?}
<A>__{grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but james' face remains unchanged, consumed with the jacket.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{pretty good. i'm friends with dr. gaskell, too.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{a door slams downstairs and grady and james jump. the click of a woman's high heels sends grady to the bedroom window, where he watches sara slide into a white citroen ds23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{we, better skedaddle. close that closet james? you ail right?}
<A>__{james is slumped on the gaskell's white linen bed, knapsack between his knees, head in hands.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm sorry. professor tripp. maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks...really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe i'm just a little sad.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{maybe. i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?}
<P>__{(off grady's look)}
<D>__{hannah mentioned something about it. about a note.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes. well. it's complicated, james. i think we should go now.}
<A>__{without thinking, grady flicks out the bedroom light, leaving james leer in the dark for the second time today. james just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{a low rumble freezes grady as he enters the hail. a few feet away, poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in grady's direction.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay. easy now. eee zy. . . .}
<A>__{grady starts to take a step, when.... poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into grady's ankle.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{grady hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting poe off the ground as he swings his leg up. poe, countering, rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops grady in a clumsy heap.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{get off of me, you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp... crack! crack! poe yelps, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto grady's legs. grady turns. james leer stands in the doorway, posed with the little pearl handled pistol like steve mcqueen. grady looks at james. then poe. then back to james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shit, james. you shoe dr. gaskell's dog.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i had to. didn't i?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{couldn't you've just pulled him off me?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no! he was crazy. i didn't he looked 1 thought }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay, okay. take it easy. don't freak out on me.}
<A>__{grady roils down his sock. apparently, poe went through life with a slight overbite.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{do you have a mirror? it's the best way to see if someone's breathing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he's dead, james. believe me, i know a dead dog when i see one.}
<A>__{james looks miserably at poe.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<A>__{grady rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{first you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours.}

<D>__{professor tripp? can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yea, james.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{what are we going to do with...}
<A>__{james glances in the backseat, where poe lies, strange blue eyes gleaming.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{trust me, james, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{does she want to hear it was one of her professors?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i've got tenure.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot thaw hall (campus)}
<A>__{as sporadic applause wafts from the high windowpanes of thaw hall, grady leans into the galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a zippered suitcase.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{james totters forward, arms hooked under poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. grady frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{he's still a little warm.}
<A>__{they lay him down, push him deep into the trunk until there is a sound like a pencil snapping.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{yuck.}
<A>__{grady grabs crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's a. big trunk. it fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{that's just what they used to say in the ads. come on, crabtree, i know you're holding...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{whose tuba is that anyway?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{miss sloviak's.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{can i ask you something about her?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she is. ah. here we go...}
<A>__{grady unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane size bottle of jack daniels, then grabs another pair of boxers.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{oh. so. is is your friend crabtree is he gay?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{most of the time he is, james. some of the time he isn't. now what do we have here?}
<A>__{grady rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of white pills, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{looks like ...our old friend mr. codeine. that should take the pinch out of my ankle.}
<P>__{(handing the bottle to james)}
<D>__{have one.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no thanks. i'm fine without them.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right. that's why you were standing in the chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. you're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.}
<A>__{grady opens the tiny bottle of jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm sorry, james. i'm sorry i said that.}
<A>__{recklessly, james takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of jack. half a second later, he spits it all out. grady looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{how 'bout we try that again.}
<L>__{interior auditorium later}
<A>__{on the stage. walter gaskell stands alone at a podium.}

<D>__{...really needs no introduction. walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you. you all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call.. .q.}
<A>__{as the audience thunders, grady and james slink into the auditorium. it's standing room only. as they head for an open space against the back wail, grady squeezes past a kid with a goatee .who regards him warily.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{grady stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush. finally, he speaks again.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{i am a writer.}
<A>__{as the audience explodes with glee, grady frowns. he glances to his right, sees james' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement.}
<C>__{q }
<D>__{as a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie." presumably, each of you has}
<P>__{an idea. (gestures to the audience)}
<D>__{but, how do you go from there to here? how do you go from having an idea to having a book? how do you get across? what is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? faith. faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you...}
<A>__{grady glances at james, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, sara standing by the far exit. a blink later, she is gone.}
<C>__{q }
<D>__{...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell.}
<A>__{grady leans back, listening to the beating of his own heart, the soft glimmer of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head... abruptly, james laughs out loud some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. as q looks and four hundred other heads turn, james ducks down mortified. crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies james with amusement, then winks at grady. grady blinks, turns to james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<L>__{interior lobby}
<A>__{grady bursts through the auditorium doors and into the lobby. a pair. of local booksellers, chatting quietly behind a table arrayed with the books of attending authors, glance up as grady limps toward the restrooms.}

<C>__{sara's voice}
<D>__{grady? grady?}
<A>__{grady opens his eyes, finds sara's face swimming above him. he is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.}

<D>__{it's it's a souvenir. of baltimore.}

<D>__{well, james, you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.}
<A>__{as james contemplates this, the doorbell rings. grady looks up, sees the police car he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway.}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but i can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious. ..wait. there was one guy. tiny fella. claimed to be a jockey.}

<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{huh? oh, someone pulled a b&e on dr. gaskell's closet. and the dog's missing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that's weird.}
<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{we figure the perpetrator let him out. he's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{the perpetrator.}
<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{no, the dog.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{just kidding.}
<A>__{pupcik nods slowly, as if re filing grady under "dealing with assholes."}
<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{one other thing. about this kid, this student of yours leer james leer. you wouldn't know how i could get in touch with him, would you?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i might have his number on campus.}
<C>__{officer pupcik}
<D>__{that's all right. we'll find him.}

<D>__{there you are...}

<D>__{i thought we were going to talk. last night.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oh. well. i...}
<A>__{hannah stretches and the t shirt slides dangerously up her thighs.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{it's okay. ..i'm here when you want me.}
<A>__{grady stands frozen as hannah smiles sleepily, pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen. a thumping is heard as james, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down the last few steps of the stairway. he watches pete pupcik drive away in his big police car.}

<D>__{what do we do now?}
<A>__{#####before grady can reply, .the telephone sitting on the table next to him #####rings.}

<D>__{could you hold on a minute, honey?}
<A>__{with a look of wonderment, grady watches his hand ever so gently ...hang up the phone.}

<L>__{exterior grady's house morning (moments later)}
<A>__{james, now wearing one of grady's flannel shirts beneath his ratty overcoat, follows grady to the galaxie, knapsack swinging from his shoulder. grady tosses him a ring of}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you start her up.}
<A>__{as grady runs a plastic wedge over the glaze of ice blanketing the windshield, james stares curiously at the keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides behind the steering wheel.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(as the engine roars)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well done, james.}
<A>__{as grady works, james' face comes into view, then ...the wedge snaps, splintering into the flesh of grady's hand.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{shit!}

<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're bleeding. professor tripp.}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{apparently not even hannah green has a clue as to the location of your apartment.}
<A>__{grady tosses the tin of band aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i got kicked out. well, not exactly kicked out. i was asked to leave.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i guess there's probably a story behind that.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{there is, but it's not that interesting.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so where have you been staying?}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{the bus station.}
<A>__{grady stares incredulously at james.}
<C>__{james leer}

<P>__{(trying to fathom this)}

<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{a couple weeks. that's why... that's why i had the gun. for protection.}
<C>__{grady}

<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{me.}

<D>__{isn't this...?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{grady gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between james legs. it's about half down.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you better ease off that stuff, james. it's pretty acidic.}
<A>__{james takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously.}

<D>__{i can't help myself. i don't know what's the matter with me.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shit, james, you're hungover. what do you think's the matter with you?}
<A>__{as grady turns away, james ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re sets the donut in precisely the same place.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse moment later}
<A>__{through the steamy panes, we see grady approach with the balloon, enter. he crosses to a high table, sets the balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{totally. i'm sorry. a lot was happening this morning. can you talk?}
<A>__{sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he's a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.}

<D>__{you heard? how?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{a twelve year old policeman came by the house this morning.}

<A>__{grady goes still, watches sara strip off the gloves, drop them on a table.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm not going to draw the map for you on this one, grady. times like these you have to do your own navigating.}
<A>__{sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the street.}

<D>__{james leer.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what's he doing out there?}

<C>__{sara}
<D>__{isn't he lucky.}
<A>__{grady watches her ripple across the glass, head for the house, and wave. james, slumped low in the galaxie, offers a limp hand in return, but it's too late. she's already gone.}

<D>__{yeah, well, actually. . .}
<A>__{james looks over.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{the moment didn't really present itself.}
<A>__{james nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. grady glances at him. at the orange juice jug.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{you' re not planning on puking in my car, are you, james?}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{don't be proud, james. we're in sewickley heights. we could find you a nice golf course to barf on.}

<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no.}

<C>__{grady }
<D>__{hannah mentioned something about an aunt.}
<A>__{james nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes a joint between his fingers, sniffs it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{humboldt county?}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{maybe...}
<C>__{james leer}

<D>__{what kind of dancer? .}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{whatever kind they wanted her to be.}

<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{james leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle. and he should know. he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.}

<D>__{didn't you say your mom went to catholic school?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{when we fall, we fall hard.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{amazing.}
<A>__{grady takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then notices with surprise james has his hand out.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{i thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.}

<D>__{maybe i just needed the moment to present itself.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood (kinship) day .(one hour later)}
<A>__{grady glides down the graceful, tree lined streets of a modest, but well kept neighborhood. james still has the joint now only a tiny nub pinched between his fingers.}

<L>__{exterior front porch winters family house}
<A>__{grady raps on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside. nothing. as he turns away, grady sees james sitting on the hood of the galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. he's sitting in the indentation.}

<D>__{someone jumped on your car with their butt .. }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you can see the outline of a butt.}

<D>__{she came here. we'll just wait. in the meantime, i need you to shimmy through.}
<A>__{james stares at the "doggy door" cut into the back porch door.}

<L>__{interior upstairs bedroom}
<A>__{grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a duffel bag open on the floor, its contents a tangle of quickly packed clothes. everything else in the room feels of another time. photographs are everywhere, documenting a pretty girl's life, from first recital to cap and gown. one photograph lies face down. grady turns it over and finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, standing in a white gown next to a younger grady on their wedding day.}
<L>__{interior den}

<A>__{grady puts his foot up on hank's lazy boy, then notices a book lying face down on the seat. the author on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential. to his surprise, grady realizes the author is himself.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{so he's one of your students, this boy?}
<A>__{grady glances into the living room, where james and irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. james is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face. grady looks out his own window, sees the newfoundland sniffing curiously at the galaxie's trunk. when he glances back into the living room, he and james make brief eye contact, then blink, look away.}

<A>__{grady sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then two shafts of light dance across his shoes. a white citroen ds23 appears. it passes. slows. stops. grady stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. sara makes a face, bugging her eyes a little mad at him, but not without humor. then she rolls down the window.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm so glad to see you, sara.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i believe you. did that nice doctor let you out? or is this you improvising again, grady?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm through improvising.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{terry told me about wonder boys. is it true? did you lose it all?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i lost it ail.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{oh, grady. you're such a putz.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{and you're old.}
<A>__{sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her fingers. yanks.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{ouch. how many?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{dozens. it's very sad.}
<A>__{sara smiles at grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his, and she glances away.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i went and looked at some babies just now.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(trying to make her laugh)}
<D>__{i guess you have to go on faith.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(she doesn't)}
<D>__{some times...}
<A>__{grady studies her as she traces her finger around the hospital bracelet still encircling his wrist.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{did you tell walter?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i told walter.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{does he still love you?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it didn't come up.}
<A>__{grady studies sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well i do. i've always loved you, sara. i didn't know it at the time, but i'd always been waiting for you. my whole life. because you're who i need. because nothing makes sense without you. because the best moment of every day is the moment i first see your face. and because when you leave a room, there's no reason to be in it any more. it's just a room again.}
<A>__{sara cocks her head.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{did you just make that up?}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{in the hospital. i "was kind of excited about it at the time, but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers.}
<A>__{she frowns good naturedly.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{even so...it's still true. every word.}
<A>__{sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{sara, i promise, even though commonsense might tell you...}
<A>__{sara turns, puts a finger on grady's lips...}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{don't write a page when a paragraph will do.}
<A>__{grady nods, takes her hand. looks at it as he speaks.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you don't deserve me, you know.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i know, but sometimes...}
<A>__{sara turns, looks at grady. her eyes are glistening.}
<C>__{sara }
<D>__{you just go on faith.}
<A>__{grady looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, drifting above the streetlights as grady limps to the other side of the car and gets in. as grady snaps shut his door, the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in the soft veil of falling snow. after a moment, grady and sara are lost too, nothing more than a blur.}
