<B>__{blackness the electronic world}
<A>__{on one side of the screen, computer programming language is being printed, and we hear the sound of an electronic keyboard. in the center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. gradually the figure is completed and refined, as we hear a resonant voice speaking.}

<D>__{as astonishing advances in computer science are made, artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life...}
<A>__{we see that the completed form is man like, heroic and muscular, wearing a form of flexible armor. the face is calm, handsome and intelligent. as the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{in a world wide network of electronics, they travel through miles of circuitry at the speed of light. we created them to calculate and research, to help us design and heal and think. with all that they can do, are they only electrical impulses... or are they a new form of life?}
<A>__{the figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the programming printed out at the side of the screen. the disk moves towards the man like figure and is rotated into position above it. as the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place on the back of the figure. there is an explosion of colored light, a resounding crash of music and the title appears across the top of the screen in huge letters.}
<D>__{t r o n ! !}
<A>__{the music continues as the glow fades and we see that the figure has become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as if it had an inner core of electricity. the following is a series of quick cuts in montage style as the opening titles roll. the montage takes place in two worlds, the electronic world and the real world. the electronic world is a mirror of our own, consisting of the electronic information in our computers, television sets and telecommunications network. it is peopled by computer programs, data, and the characters from countless video games. for the first time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through the window of television screens.}
