<L>__{exterior the mountains day}
<A>__{more cattle drive mantage taking tom and annie a bit further in their intimacy; perhaps tom takes extra special care to explain things to annie, or fix her saddle cinch, or make her laugh...}
<L>__{exterior the mountains evening}
<A>__{the cows stands in the pasture, grazing. annie and diane are cleaning some pots and pans in the stream.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, i have more than a few days, ha, ha... i uh... i'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... first time i've said it out loud.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{they fired you?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, it's more like a leave of }
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{ha, ha, ha. yeah, they fired me.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you don't seem to upset?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{delayed shock. or maybe not. i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... just not sure if i want to.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.}
<A>__{this phrase "go home" stings annie though diane said it innocently.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{did you always know this was the life you wanted?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i fell in love. after that, i never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. i never saw it like i was losing some other life, just felt like i was gaining one. i know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and i ain't saying it's the right one. we all have to find the life meant for us.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{frank's a good man.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{they don't come better. but i don't deny there are times i wonder about things i won't have. maybe one day i will get to see egypt. maybe not. but i know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{sounds like something tom would say.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{yes, it does.}
<A>__{annie and diane resume washing the dishes in silence. annie deep in thought. until diane stops. after a beat, annie notices.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{annie, i'm not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so let's just say what it is. when you first came here, i didn't like you and i was worried. tom means a lot to me and this family. don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't think anybody can make tom do anything he didn't want.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{he's a good man, tom is. he's got a gift, come from heaven above, i swear. but he's still a man. and a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake and still make him think he's on dry land.}
<A>__{diane's words ring in annie's head.}
