<L>__{exterior alleyway night}
<A>__{we're with the young man as he stalks his prey through the mediaeval maze of streets... we end up in the narrow alleyway that jack photographed on his first day in town. up ahead, disappearing round a distant bend, we catch a glimpse of jack, his heels clacking on the cobbles. the young man follows swiftly, his trainers silent. he gets to a crossroads where four narrow alleyways all identical converge. the young man is unsure which alleyway to take. the streets are empty. he listens. from an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late night film on television. it's a romantic film, the violins muffled and sad with longing. from another alleyway comes the sound of savage barking. the young man looks around for the source of the barking, but the streets are empty. suddenly, the barking stops. the young man looks confused. from his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable click of a cocking mechanism.}
