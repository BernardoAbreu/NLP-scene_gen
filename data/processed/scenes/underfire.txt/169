<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior jazy's courtyard late in day}
<A>__{jazy stands with a third gun at his head, being held by the most forceful and crazed of three young muchachos. with guns on jazy, price, and claire, there is much confusion as to who's in charge and what exactly they're doing.}
<D>__{muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{they are my friends. muchacho #2}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{shut up. we kill them all. muchacho #3}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{no. only him.}
<A>__{the guns are aimed back and forth in confusion price and claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure what to say.}
<D>__{muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{him or him or her?}
<A>__{the muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as they do, jazy addresses price and claire coolly.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{well, here we are, eh? muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{assassin! shut up!}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{the boys are confused they think i had their family killed.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you murder people.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{"murder" is a word for criminals. i have a job to protect the stability of a continent. muchacho #3 pig! hijo de puta!}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{he is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm down.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you got caught by some boys?}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{yes. poets too, i imagine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is your recorder on?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{good. i have a speech to make.}
<A>__{the muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they stop to listen to his style. the guns remained trained on all three.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{i like you people, but you are sentimental shits. you fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the marxists, the marxists fall in love with themselves. the country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants. muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and speaks with tired authority.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{un minuto, por favor. muchacho #2}
<P>__{(to price and claire, more calmly)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jazy}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{they are journalists.}
<A>__{the muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and one of them speaks in excited, broken english.}
<D>__{muchacho #1 periodistas! take this picture! i'm going to blow his head off.}
<A>__{the muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from price and claire and aim them all at jazy's head.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{somoza? he is a tyrant too, of course. a butcher.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but finally that is not the point, you see. if we wish to survive we have a choice of tyrants, and for all the right reasons, your poets choose the wrong side. muchacho #1}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{fotografia!}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your picture of rafael was brilliant... but i am alive, and better looking. a good looking frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of europe and america.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you will have another magazine cover!}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{muy complicado, no? muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{ready! now!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you picked the wrong side.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{in fifty years we will know who's right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out? this wall's a nice color, eh? i can move into the sunlight.}
<A>__{claire turns and walks away, her back to the scene.}
<C>__{jazy}
<P>__{(to claire)}
<D>__{it's just a story!}
<A>__{price remains and stares at jazy as the muchachos grow increasingly impatient. some part of him wants to take the picture.}
<D>__{muchacho #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{they say that if somebody's holding a gun on you, you should never stop talking... that's the theory who knows?...}
<A>__{price turns and walks away toward claire. still jazy talks.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{maybe it's a good thing that i talk too much...}
<B>__{a gunshot rings out.}
<A>__{price grimaces. claire shuts her eyes. they turn to look at the fallen jazy as the three muchachos, frightened by their own act, race back into the street. for several moments price and claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside. price and claire go to the doorway and look out as a jeep full of guardia screams past}
<B>__{p.o.v. several guerrillas retreating from an advancing}
<A>__{tanquetta a block away. the neighborhood seems to be changing hands again. price and claire slump in the darkness near the doorway; she touches near his wounded arm.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you okay?}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{russell... what did alex do?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{nothing. he asked for directions.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and leans it against price's shoulder but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a moment of mourning. their heads pop up nervously.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{we gotta get outta sight half the fucking army's looking for me...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{they're not looking for me.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{let me have the film...}
<P>__{(beat; unsure)}
<D>__{...if i can't get to the hotel i will come back here...}
<A>__{price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited about hiding out in the middle of the city either.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{aw, christ...}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i've wrecked everything else, at least let me take care of you here.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{russell... it's more dangerous being with you than being alone.}
<A>__{he knows she's right. he loves her, and he's made enough disastrous decisions lately. he hesitates, then pops open his camera and removes the film. price ties the film into the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.}
<B>__{price and claire embrace and kiss briefly}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{don't get hurt.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(affectionately)}
<D>__{that's great advice.}
<A>__{they kiss, and claire runs out after a red cross truck. price watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight, then goes back inside jazy's courtyard. price nearly stumbles over jazy's body, stops, stares he'd forgotten already. the body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds a sheet and covers jazy. price then sits down and waits nervously, sharing the courtyard with jazy.}
