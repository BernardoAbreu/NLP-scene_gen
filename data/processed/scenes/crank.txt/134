<L>__{ext chinatown, outdoor plaza, moments later}
<A>__{eve storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam behind her. chev follows, staggering like a drunk man. he catches up to her and grabs her arm.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{eve... baby... please!}
<A>__{she spins on him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{mob hits, chev? chinese poison? do you know how ridiculous you sound? if you’re going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{you think it sounds crazy? how do you think i feel i’ve gotta live this shit...}
<A>__{just then the camera slams through chev’s transparent chest his heart seems to grind down and stall, mid pump, as the poison’s progress moves another clock tick forward. the camera pulls violently out of chev’s chest cavity he looks like someone just fired a cannonball into his gut... face white as a dinner plate... it’s the worst we’ve seen him yet.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh my god, chev... what’s the matter with you?}
<A>__{he looks around like a drowning man. people everywhere, but starting to disperse as lunch hour dwindles. the world starts to spin.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i... just need...}
<A>__{chev falls to his knees, pulling her down with him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{chev, you’re scaring me.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(getting a desperate idea)}
<D>__{wait a minute. do you trust me?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{make love to me.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{come on. i think it’ll help.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{help what?}
<A>__{he starts grabbing at her. she pushes his hands away.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{get off! are you kidding me?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{take your clothes off.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{you always say you want to be more spontaneous.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you’re insane. you’re like some adrenaline junkie with no soul.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{save me, eve. save my life.}
<A>__{chev starts feeling up eve’s ass.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{she slugs him in the mouth. his head snaps back; he comes up holding his lip.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{oh my god, chev!}
<A>__{she reaches instinctively to comfort him and he lunges forward, tearing at her dress. they roll around on the ground, scratching and clawing at one another. a curious crowd gathers round. eve starts to flip out, screaming and pounding on him with her fists like a crazy woman. next thing you know she’s kissing and biting his mouth, breathless, still pounding with her fists.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{you filthy animal ...}
<A>__{she reaches down and starts fumbling with his pants. he helps. the onlookers’ eyes widen, moms covering the kids’ faces.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{take me right here in front of everyone.}
<A>__{chev’s heartbeat starts to pick up. he lifts her dress and positions himself on top of her. eve is completely out of her head, eyes closed, legs up in the air like a porn star.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{that’s it... do it ...}
<A>__{chev thrusts.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{come on, put it in me...}
<A>__{he thrusts again. eve’s eyes pop open.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{what are you waiting for?}
<A>__{chev looks down at his equipment, then up at eve, helplessly.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d) (incredulously)}
<D>__{tell me you’re joking. now you can’t get it up?}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{i’ll fucking get it up!}
<A>__{with a surge of energy he lifts her off the ground, drags her over to a newspaper machine on the street the crowd parts to let them through and bends her over it. he tries again to enter her.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{god damn it, chev ...!}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{he starts to spank her. she responds with a moan. a certain portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause. chev picks up the pace. eve begins making primal cries. a busload of japanese girls pulls up tourists in matching red uniforms gaping out the window with slack jawed amazement. with the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, chev gets a shot of adrenaline and goes for broke. eve shrieks like a banshee as he enters her.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{i’m still alive! i’m still alive!!!}
<A>__{chev’s heartbeat is slamming, he’s really giving it to her, making full eye contact with the busload of tourists the entire time. chev doubles his efforts, desperately fighting for the climax, when ... bee dee dee deee dee deee dee dee dum.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh god... oh god... yes...}
<A>__{bee dee dee deee dee deee dee dee dum. chev’s cellphone.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{chev reaches for the phone.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what are you doing?!!}
<A>__{chev puts the phone up to his ear.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{yeah.}
