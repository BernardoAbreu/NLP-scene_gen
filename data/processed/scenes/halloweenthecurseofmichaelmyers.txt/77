<L>__{interior tommy's apartment day}
<A>__{the sound of jangling keys. a door unlocking. tommy scrambles in, the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other. with a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then carefully lays down the crying infant. he digs through the bag: baby wipes. diapers. formula. bottles.}

<D>__{shhh. okay, okay, kyle. you like that name? yeah, i think it suits you.}
<A>__{quickly he scans the directions on the formula. pours the liquid into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the business at hand. tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber. the baby cries harder.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is worse for me than it is for you.}
<A>__{armed with baby wipe and a diaper, tommy goes to work. upstairs hallway (same) mrs. blankenship traverses the hall outside tommy's apartment. the baby's cries; tommy's grossed out groans can clearly be heard. but the old woman keeps walking, oblivious to it all. tommy's apartment (same) tommy finishes securing the diaper. the baby in his arms, he tests the formula's temperature and feeds him. the infant sucks voraciously. the crying stops. tommy rocks him gently.}

<D>__{it's okay, big guy. don't you worry. i'm gonna take care of you.}
