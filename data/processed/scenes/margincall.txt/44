<C>__{seth}
<D>__{jesus man.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....it's a fear of losing faith.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you.}
<C>__{will emerson}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{how would they even do that?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{you can't... it's impossible. but they'll figure out a way. i've been at this place for ten years and i've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. they don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.}

<D>__{yeah... i did.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what do you do with all that money?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i don't know really. it goes pretty quick. you learn to spend what's in your pocket.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{two and a half million goes quickly?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{well the tax man takes half of it up front. so now you got what... million and a quarter. mortgage grabs another 300k, i gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{eight hundred.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i bought a car last year for 150. probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{smart. (smiles)}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{peter}

<A>__{will emerson takes a long drag off his cigarette.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{76,520?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{yeah, kinda shocked me, although i was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.}
<A>__{with that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive corporate helicopter comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads. they are now yelling above the rotor noise.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{whoa!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{whoa!}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{what time is it?}
