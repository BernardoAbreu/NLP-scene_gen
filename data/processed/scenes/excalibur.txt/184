<L>__{exterior moors by the sea sunset}
<A>__{perceval returns to the king, terribly excited, shouting from his horse:}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{arthur!}
<A>__{but arthur isn't there. perceval looks around him, he doesn't understand. he sees a trail of blood. he spurs his horse and follows the trail down to the sea.}
<L>__{exterior beach sunset then night}
<A>__{there is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a man crawling. perceval follows them toward the sea. he looks around, searching, terribly distraught. where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints coming from and returning into the sea. perceval looks out across the waves. he sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell. on its deck he can make out the distant figure of arthur, lying surrounded by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind. the sun hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it. he gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt:}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{arthur! will you return?}
<A>__{the sun slips below the horizon. night is falling, and the wind whips the wavecrests. he turns from the sea and wades back.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{all the knights of the round table are dead. excalibur is returned. arthur is gone. maybe he lives, maybe he will return...}
<A>__{he stops at the edge of the water. in the uncertain light sky and sea become one. he draws the chalice out of a pouch on his saddle, and he holds it up before him.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{only i remain, and this...}
<A>__{the wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of the cup. music grand and melancholic grows from it. the chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken from sight in the enfolding darkness.}
