<L>__{interior paul's house later}
<A>__{jules steps tentatively into paul's house.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{paul?}
<A>__{jules walks further into the house. she looks anxious. paul opens his office door and sees jules in the hall.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hey. what's up?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry about last night. i'm really embarrassed.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't be. she's the one who wigged out.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jules, it's okay. you don't have to defend her.}
<A>__{they stare at each other, unsure how to act.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{and look, i just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something i...do.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, i sensed that.}
<A>__{she takes a step toward him, feverish.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i just wanted to clear the air.}
<A>__{they stare at each other. it's like watching two magnets.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the air is clear.}
<A>__{jules grabs paul and starts smothering him with kisses. it takes a second for paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{paul, i can't!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you don't want to?!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{no, i do! it's just...}
<P>__{(urgent whisper)}
<D>__{i have a guy outside!}
<A>__{overcome with lust, jules wraps her legs around his waist and paul walks her into...}
<B>__{his bedroom}
<A>__{quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. somewhere between slapstick and animal. he pulls her hair back hard. she loves it. she pulls his hair back harder. he yelps. she pulls down his underwear. her eyes widen. it's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{oh. well. hel lo!}
<A>__{cut to them fucking. it's gawky and passionate. somewhere in the middle of it, jules starts laughing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more. she keeps laughing. paul goes harder to make her stop. the paces grows quicker. they're getting closer. and then...}
<C>__{luis }
<D>__{hello? excuse me, senora allgood?!}
<A>__{they stop mid thrust.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you gotta be fucking kidding me!}
<A>__{she dislodges from paul and starts dressing furiously.}
