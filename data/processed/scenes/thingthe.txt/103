<L>__{interior kennel night}
<A>__{the night feeding. clark dishes out the food. blair is taking blood samples from the remaining three dogs.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(perplexed, bothered)}
<D>__{clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? just anything at all? any little thing?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{no. just that he recovered real quick... that night when i found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage. before i put him with the others, i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...}
<A>__{a beat as blair stares at clark.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{that night?}
<C>__{clark}
<P>__{(pets dog vigorously)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{what was he doing in the rec room?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{well, after i worked on him thought i'd let him rest. left the room for a bit. when i came back, he was gone.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{well, where was he? where did he go?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{don't know. looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{you're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?}
<A>__{clark seems uneasy under blair's intense gaze.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{well... yeah.}
<A>__{blair stands, his eyes still glued to clark.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{how long were you with the dog? alone, i mean?}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{ah... he was hurt bad. bullet nicked an artery... i don't know... an hour... hour and a half...}
<A>__{blair's eyes glaze as if in revelation.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{what the hell you looking at me like that for?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{nothing. nothing at all.}
<A>__{he backs out of the kennel.}
