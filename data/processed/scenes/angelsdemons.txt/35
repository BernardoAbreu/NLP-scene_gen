<L>__{int rocher's office day}
<A>__{a few moments later, they're crowded around the communications console at rocher's desk, where a dimly lit video recording is playing back on a computer screen. (the office is behind a glass wall to one side of the headquarters.) the images on the recording are of four older men, some in their sixties, the others in their seventies, filmed in dim light behind bars in a dank, dungeon like space. a lightly accented voice speaks from behind the camera.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{we will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... and then bring your church down upon you. vatican city will be consumed by light.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{it's an ancient llluminati threat.}
<P>__{(rocher pauses the recording)}
<D>__{the destruction of vatican city through light. the four pillars he probably means the kidnapped cardinals. you didn't mention they were the preferiti.}
<P>__{(to vittoria)}
<D>__{the favorites to be chosen as the new pope. play it again.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{we will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science...}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{stop it there.}
<A>__{rocher does}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{"brand" them, another llluminati legend, this one says there are a set of five brands, each one an ambigram.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{the first four are the fundamental elements of science earth, air, fire, water. the fifth is a mystery. maybe it's this.}
<A>__{he pulls the "llluminati" ambigram from his pocket.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{he said they'd be killed publicly. in churches.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(nods, not surprised)}
<D>__{revenge for la purga.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{la purga?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{don't you guys read your own history? 1668. the church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross. to "purge their sins." murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters. it was after la purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged. this sounds like retribution.}
<P>__{(to rocher)}
<D>__{is there any more?}
<A>__{rocher hits play again.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{.... and then bring your church down upon you. vatican city will be consumed by light...}
<A>__{while listening this time, langdon notices a darkened video monitor, inlaid at an angle on rocher's desk. it faces away from the outer office, and instead of an on off switch, there is an oddly shaped keyhole.}
<D>__{voice (o.s.) (cont'd) a shining star at the end of the path of illumination.}
<A>__{langdon looks up sharply.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the path of illumination?}
<A>__{rocher stops the video.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{i need to get into the vatican archives.}
<A>__{rocher shakes his head, looks at olivetti harshly, is embarrassed.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{professor, this is not the appropriate moment to }
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{your petition has been denied seven times, mr. langdon.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{this has nothing to do with that,}
<P>__{(fast)}
<D>__{the path of illumination is an ancient trail through rome that leads to the church of the illumination, a secret place where llluminati members could meet in safety. if i can find the segno, the sign that marks the start of the path, i'm willing to bet the four churches along it are where he intends to murder your cardinals. if we can get to one of them before he does, we can stop it. but to find the start of the path, i need to get into the archives.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{even if i wanted to help you, access is only by written decree of the curator and the board of vatican librarians.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{or by papal mandate.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{yes. but as you've no doubt heard, the holy father is }
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{what about il camerlengo? let me talk to him.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{the camerlengo? he's just a priest here, the former pope's chamberlain.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{doesn't the power of the holy see rest with him during tempe sede vacante?}
<A>__{they just stare at him. shit, this guy's good. langdon checks his watch, getting irritated.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{hey, fellas you called me.}
