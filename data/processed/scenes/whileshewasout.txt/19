<A>__{della slows down for another red light. she's at a wide crossroads where the housing development abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins. a billboard for another new housing development announces: "green street dream homes investment opportunities". waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof. della tries not to look at it. a recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead changes to green.}
