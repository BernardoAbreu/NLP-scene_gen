<A>__{a row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients. chattering away. therapy in full session. serena sits in front of her regular nail technician.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{it was awful. we all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift.}
<A>__{the nail technician shakes her head in shared girl power angst — looking over at elle, who sits in the waiting area, shell shocked, but showered. elle picks up the only magazine left on the table — "town & country". she wrinkles her nose. an old lady next to her reads "seventeen". elle looks at her, begrudging the access to teen beauty tips, and flips through "town & country" noisily until she freezes on— the engagement section. she gasps.}

<D>__{oh, my god!}
<A>__{she looks at a photo of a horse faced young woman standing next to a three years older version of warner. she turns to the old lady next to her.}

<D>__{do you know who this is?}

<A>__{she turns to the old lady.}
<C>__{elle }

<D>__{this is the type of girl warner wants to marry. this is what i need to become to be serious.}
<A>__{the old lady looks at the picture.}
<C>__{old lady}
<D>__{butt ugly?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{no a law student.}
