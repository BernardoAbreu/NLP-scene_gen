<L>__{exterior western woods, tree of the dead day}
<A>__{raining still. ichabod, masbath and katrina come into a clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of... a monstrously huge tree of the dead, at the clearing's center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture. ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow. young masbath and katrina dismount.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{you were right... it does draw attention to itself.}
<A>__{ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches. he circles the incredibly wide trunk. there's a vertical wound in the bark, as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred. ichabod approaches. he feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle. it is red and ichabod fingers it.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{blood.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{ichabod goes to where katrina and masbath wait with the horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{stay back.}
<A>__{at the trunk, ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the suture. it sounds hollow. ichabod begins to chop. he pulls away loose bark. the tree drips more blood and a clear goo. ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the festering suture.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{just... keep where you are.}
<A>__{ignoring, young masbath moves closer. ichabod keeps chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to bend it. it's not easy. ichabod struggles. katrina follows masbath's slow advance. ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood soaked, wide eyed, gap mouthed human head. ichabod recoils. behind him, katrina stifles a scream, taking young masbath in her arms to keep him from looking. it is philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by roots grown around and into the flesh. ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth. four other severed, decaying heads are held by ingrown roots within the dewy innards.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{my god... what has happened?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{he... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.}
<A>__{he looks to the branches towering above.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{must be some sort of gateway. but, why this place... ?}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{we should go.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{why this tree?}
<A>__{ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree. he gets to his knees, pushing mud away. uncovering a flush headstone carved with "666."}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{"climb down to the horseman's soulless place."}
<P>__{(to masbath)}
<D>__{bring the shovel.}
