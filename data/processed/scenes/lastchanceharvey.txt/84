<L>__{exterior london streets late afternoon}
<A>__{montage: accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty, we watch from a distance as harvey and kate navigate the buzzing streets of central london. all is alive and well. harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before. as they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, policemen chat, and office workers linger. london is at its best.}
