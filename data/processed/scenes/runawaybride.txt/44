<A>__{in front of beauty salon, maggie follows ike out.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{if you're looking for elm street, it's that way. she puts on her sunglasses.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{thank you. he walks the other way.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{if you came down here in the pursuit of happiness, you might as well go back. because you can't make me feel bad. she stops walking and turns to ike.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i'm not here to make you feel bad. i'm here for vindication. in my heart...}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you have one? ike walks back to maggie.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i feel i'm right about you. you got me fired, lady. you destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair. you chew men up, spit them out and loved it. and i'm down here to satisfy myself on that pointerior passersby stare at ike's hair and giggle.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{did something happen to make you care about reality?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{yes. conviction. conviction that i'm onto the truth. you're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. you're going to run again. and i'm not leaving until you do.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you're going to be very disappointed.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'd love to stay and chat, but i've got to get back to work. i still have my job. he stares at her for a beat, stung by her words.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i have nothing to hide, mr. graham. talk to whoever you want. you might actually stumble upon a fact or two. maggie walks away. ike walks a few steps and stops at a kid on a bike.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{hey, kid, i will give you ten bucks for your hat. kid agrees. ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street. an old woman walks by and hits him with a newspaper. ike is stunned.}
