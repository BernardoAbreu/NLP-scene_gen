<L>__{exterior tracy on street night}
<A>__{a series of shots of tracy walking home. the camera remains consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes dollying with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up her passing reflection in a darkened store window. the impression this gives is unmistakable. curt duncan is following her. we do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we know he is there. often we can sense that the very angle from which we see tracy is his pov. but tracy is aware of nothing. we know this when the camera begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety. tension mounts as we start to expect that duncan will jump out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. but he doesn't. finally, tracy walks up to the camera at the end of a block and turns a corner; but the camera holds on the dark street she has just come up. we hear a cough which confirms that duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.}
