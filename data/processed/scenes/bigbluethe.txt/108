<L>__{interior diving capsule day}
<A>__{the diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its descent through a trap door in the deck. it plunges into the sea. the three men in the capsule are: jacques, enzo and the tough looking capsule commander noireuter, who is much too professional for enzo's tastes. enzo watches through a porthole while the commander concentrates on the control console. he runs through a checklist of systems. jacques responds with a "check" as he verifies each one. enzo is already bored and fed up by the procedures. jacques is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{you still thinking about her?}
<A>__{jacques doesn't answer. enzo goes on.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{don't think about her anymore! let me tell you, you're just making yourself unhappy! there are so many women in the world!}
<A>__{he takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and stares at noireuter.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{plenty of women everywhere right?}
<C>__{noireuter}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{smoking is absolutely forbidden.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{it isn't lit yet.}
<C>__{noireuter}
<D>__{you shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!}
<C>__{noireuter}
<P>__{(stubborn)}
<D>__{the rules are the rules.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(checking out this creature)}
<D>__{... what's your name again?}
<C>__{noireuter}
<D>__{noireuter.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{and where did you say you were from?}
<C>__{noireuter}
<D>__{i didn't say...}
<P>__{(contemptuous)}
<D>__{brussels!}
<A>__{enzo smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly. the commander's answer explains it all.}
