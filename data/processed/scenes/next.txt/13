<C>__{cris}
<D>__{christ, guy, did you have to?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you say everything's inevitable, so i guess i did.}
<A>__{guy returns to his antique copper espresso machine and starts to make two cups.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{well, you can save your breath. cause i know what you're gonna say.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{then you're aware that neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that. but i'm done playing the market.}
<A>__{while guy is distracted making espresso, cris jams the desk drawer shut with a penny.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{neal's got it all worked out. he'll fly you out of the country on his jet. put you up in style. he pays taxes, totally legal. you get cash, squeaky clean. half the net. when your share hits fifty mil, you can say "finito"...and it's over.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{except last time, neal didn't take "finito" for an answer.}
<A>__{guy slams his fist.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you need us, asshole! the law is breathin' down your neck!}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i can stay ahead of `em forever.}

<D>__{because i don't want to be used any more.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what do you give a shit as long as you get what you want?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{cause what i want is freedom. and you don't get it by giving it up.}
<A>__{guy calms himself and sets an espresso in front of cris.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{enjoy it while it lasts.}
<A>__{cris picks up the cup and knocks it back. exterior finish line parking lot day cris starts up the car. notices he's woozy. he prepares to back out. instead he blacks out as guy and three men drag him out of the car.}
