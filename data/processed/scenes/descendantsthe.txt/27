<A>__{matt sits across from old family friend dr. sam johnston.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{bad news, matt. dr. chun, dr. mueller and i we believe her condition, which we call a multi factorial anoxic encephalopathy, is deteriorating. we see no eye movement, no pupillary response, basically no brainstem reflexes whatsoever. the machines could keep her going, but her quality of life would be... very poor. basically what you see now. she'll never be like she was, matt. never. we know that now.}
<A>__{matt sits very still.}
<C>__{dr. johnston }
<D>__{i can't tell you how sorry i am to have to tell you this. and you have your daughters. there's just nothing we can do.}

<D>__{so... if we do go ahead and take her off the machines }
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{not if, matt. when. i have a legal obligation. you know that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how long will she last?}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{hard to say. could be a few days. could be two weeks. but for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. i know i need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away.}
<A>__{organ donation? forgot about that one.}
<C>__{dr. johnston }
<D>__{elizabeth has so many friends, a big life. last time i was at your house, must have been 200 people. if you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now. by the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel. i'm so sorry, matt.}
