She reaches the other hand towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away... THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as... A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her. Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead... Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{CLYDE}
<ACTION>__{is standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.}

<ACTION>__{Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the room. Renee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside. Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings again and misses... Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys go down...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{RENEE}
<ACTION>__{Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor. Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the flame to the perfume-soaked floor... FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, igniting the curtains... We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON GEOFF AND CLYDE}
<ACTION>__{As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl. Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his teeth... Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye... Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to his feet... Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing. Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across the floor... Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff turns... And here comes Clyde...}

Then Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE FLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls... Geoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs to Chase... Chase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his father to his feet...}

<ACTION>__{Geoff turns away, horrified. With Chase on his shoulder, he reaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall. He spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door... Ignoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again, chopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames are almost upon them... Finally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns and lifts Chase up once more... At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.}
