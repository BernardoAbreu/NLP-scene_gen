<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{malik sprints straight into traffic. a car screeches, not stopping in time... malik goes right over the hood. harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him. malik sees harry coming after him like a juggernaut. he turns and sees a motorcyclist coming down the street, accelerating from a right turn. malik runs at him, clothes lining him right off the bike. the terrorist picks up the nimble little kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on. he pops the clutch and takes off. harry pounds after him like a locomotive. he sees malik turn, taking the bike path into a large park. harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.}
