<L>__{interior jacques room jacques}
<A>__{jacques is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore. he is breathing loudly, as if tired out. from his pov the room becomes very dark and blue. the noise is unbearable. the ceiling turns into water. jacques' eyes are wide open. his face is sweating. the water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he is swallowed by it. as he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue. the dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km h underwater. they all break through the surface to gulp air regularly. suddenly, one of them, leaves the group. he crosses the blue and seems to make sonar like sounds. we see a sonar picture. it's an image in which the dolphin will appear a few seconds later. the dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down. the sonar image appears again. finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane. he manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim. he breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down. he goes full power. the fish he is after are even more divided. there is only one left, totally lost and in a panic. the exhausted fish is swallowed. the dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion. images becomes pale and bright. he screams inhumanly. image is white, black, silence.}
