<L>__{exterior beach dusk}
<A>__{shrek, holding puss and donkey, staggers onto a small beach. he glares at artie who pulls himself out of the surf. shrek drops puss and donkey. puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. his fur puffs up into a fro. he drops his head in shame.}
<C>__{puss}
<D>__{how humiliating...}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, nice going, your highness.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{oh, so now it's "your highness?" what happened to "loser?" huh?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. we're heading back to far far away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!}
<A>__{artie raises an eyebrow. puss and donkey stare at shrek uncomfortably.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{a hem. you just said father...}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you're... i said king. you're gonna be king!}
<C>__{artie}
<P>__{(imitating shrek)}
<D>__{"you're gonna be king!" yeah right. shrek the third final screening script 60.}
<A>__{artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a path into the woods.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{far far away... from you!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you get back here young man and i mean it!}
<A>__{artie keeps climbing.}
<C>__{puss}
<D>__{uh boss, i don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. he is not exactly king material.}
<A>__{shrek looks towards artie.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{when were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be king?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh c'mon, now why would i do that? besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.}
<A>__{shrek starts off after artie. donkey jumps in front of shrek.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{hey, woah ho ho, shrek. then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you're right, donkey.}
<A>__{shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what about this?}
<A>__{donkey shakes his head in disgust.}
<D>__{shrek the third final screening script 61.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek!}
<A>__{shrek tosses the log.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh c'mon. it's just a joke.}
