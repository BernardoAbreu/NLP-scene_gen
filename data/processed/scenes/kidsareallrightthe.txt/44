<L>__{exterior paul's house echo park day}
<A>__{jules drives slowly up the hill looking for paul's address. she sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle.}
<L>__{exterior paul's house back yard day}
<A>__{jules and paul walk through paul's backyard, evaluating.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{...we could do a kind of a secret garden thing with trellises and topiary...}
<P>__{(clocking his face)}
<D>__{...or something more asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. it's up to you...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{personally, i'm tired of minimal. i'm into more is more. let's not try to tame the space. i think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fecund?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you know, fertile...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, i love that word. you just don't hear it that often.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{more is more. yeah. let's do that.}
<A>__{jules is staring at paul.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{sorry, i just keep seeing my kids in your expressions...}
<A>__{jules looks more intensely at paul's face.}
<C>__{jules }
<D>__{you and laser have the same mouth.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the observation strikes paul. suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast tracked intimacy with jules he hadn't expected.}
