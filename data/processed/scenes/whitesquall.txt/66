<L>__{exterior albatross night}
<A>__{the crew lean along the rail waving goodbye to the girls who wave back with their white handkerchiefs.}
<L>__{interior main cabin same}
<A>__{chuck and john hold phil still as robin picks shards of glass out of his feet. phil clenches his jaw, but his eyes are dry.}
<L>__{exterior albatross day}
<A>__{the ship is under full sail driving before a brisk following wind. it takes two on the helm to keep her safely on course. those not on watch are sprawled about the boat, scraping and 'red leading' or reading. chuck and robin sit forward with john, studying. lawford paces the deck, chiding the crew.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{read on, young john. read on. college boards are coming.}
<A>__{john looks down, dejected. suddenly tod cries from the foretop.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{there they blow!! there they blow!! dolphins off the bow!!!}
<A>__{everyone rushes to see. dolphins leaping out of the water. it's a magnificent game they play with ships. the crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close enough to touch. isolated, phil watches. angry, cut off. chuck eyes him, worried. bill and charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower rick into the water. suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere. rick pets them as they swim back and forth. shear joy. phil reaches for the spear gun. nobody notices as he loads and takes aim. suddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around. a large female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam spraying from her blow hole. she lets out an agonizing scream. phil holds her fast.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{the crew can only watch, stunned. phil is suddenly, defensive as if waking from a dream.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{fuck off man. it's just a fish.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no, phil. it's a mammal.}
<A>__{skipper steps on deck, sees the dolphin and phil with the spear gun.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{bill, lower a long boat. we'll bring her up with the davit.}
<A>__{a dory is lowered with john and bill inside. once near the water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a canvas harness. the crew hoist her with the davit tackle, swing her inboard, and gently lower her to the deck. they gather around the gasping animal. alice checks the wound. skipper kneels beside her.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's through her lung.}
<A>__{skipper turns to phil.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to phil)}
<D>__{nice shot.}
<A>__{phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away. chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away. skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to phil.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{finish it.}
<A>__{phil looks at the mallet, horrified.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(stammering)}
<D>__{i'm not gonna kill it.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you already have. now go on. do it.}
<A>__{phil backs away. skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin. robin looks away. the sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world. there are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over. skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches phil, his face flushed with anger. he grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you?!}
<A>__{phil begins to shake with rage.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{come on. you got so much fight in you; you wanna kill something? take your best shot. the first one's free.}
<A>__{robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away. for a brief moment phil looks as if he might take skipper up on the challenge. then the impulse passes.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're done. you're going home.}
<A>__{skipper turns. the humiliation is more than phil can take. he lunges after skipper. lawford grabs him. phil swings wildly.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you mean assed bastard!! you son of a bitch!! you can't do this!!! you can't do this!!! god damn you!! god damn you!!}
<A>__{lawford leads phil, struggling, below. the crew surround the dead dolphin, stunned.}
