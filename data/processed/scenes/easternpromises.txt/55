<D>__{nikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is about to get in to his car. anna flies at him, yelling.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she was fourteen! read the diary! she was fourteen when he raped her! nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{you murdered her! you bastards murdered her! passers by stare at anna. helen and stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her. nikolai stops and judges the fury on anna's face. he speaks calmly.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{anger is very dangerous. it makes people do stupid things. forget any of this ever happened. you're in the wrong place, anna ivanovna. he gestures at the burger restaurant.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{you belong in there. with nice people. stay away from people like me. anna and nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a strange connection between them. then stepan steps forward and spits in nikolai's face, delivering a russian curse as he does so. nikolai almost reacts out of instinct but stops himself. nikolai wipes his face and peers into anna's eyes. finally he gets into his car and drives away.}
