<D>__{... and therefore nothing could justify the participation of your highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical... if not impossible.}
<A>__{he shakes his head, puts the letter down. columbus looks appalled; devastated.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{they didn't listen. they didn't want to listen!}
<A>__{he paces about the book lined room.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{you mustn't give way to despair. you must wait.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{wait! i've waited seven years already! how much longer do you want me to wait?}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{if god intends you to go, then you will go.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(angrily)}

<A>__{marchena is shocked.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{colon!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{damn all of you! you all set up theories based on what? you never leave the safety of your studies! go out! find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to!}
<A>__{he seizes a beautiful book from marchena's desk.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{these don't mean anything! they're full of assumptions! out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens!}

<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{all of them! just lies!}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{colon! don't!}
<A>__{marchena tries to stop him. in his fury, columbus accidentally knocks the poor old man to the ground. his cries bring three monks rushing into the room. as columbus continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man to almost comical effect. finally, a short, muscular monk delivers a quick punch that sends columbus crashing to the floor.}
