<D>__{can we try them?}
<A>__{sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious lightness:}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{go ice skating? ha...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you sure mama?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{strikes me that after your man leaves, it might just be the wrong time to be scrubbing floors... might just be the perfect time to go ice skating.}
<A>__{denver and beloved register hopefulness in the light of sethe's attitude. sethe speaks to denver;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{go get the shawls..and find me an old shoe for that half a pair...}
