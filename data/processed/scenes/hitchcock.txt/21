<A>__{a pianist plays a polite version of al jolson's "my mammy". close on a manila envelope clutched in one hand behind hitchcock's back as we follow him travel through the party. the clink of champagne glasses as we reveal the guests saying hello as he passes...}
<P>__{alfred hitchcock (pre lap)}
<D>__{and when the wisconsin police department raided his farmhouse in plainview...}
<C>__{hitchcock}
<A>__{is now in position in front of the fire place. around the coffee table are invited gossip columnists, including a hedda hopper type. they take in the gory life magazine article.}
<D>__{alfred hitchcock (pre lap) (cont'd) ..they opened the door only to discover voila...}
<A>__{he produces the manila envelope from behind his back and empties the horrifically gory crime scene photographs inside onto the coffee table.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{... ten female heads with the tops sawn off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade.}
<A>__{hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions...}
<C>__{hedda hopper type}
<D>__{is this really going to be you're next picture, mr. hitchcock?}
<C>__{hitchcock}
<D>__{that is my intention, madam. yes.}
<A>__{hitch taps the photo of ed gein.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i only wish he looked more like william holden and less like elmer fudd.}
<A>__{the other columnists scribble down the quote.}
<C>__{hedda hopper type}
<D>__{am i the only one who finds this offensive?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i was hoping everyone would. i mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it?}
<A>__{hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{try the finger sandwiches they're real fingers.}
<A>__{he snags a martini and collars peggy while he's at it.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{peggy. i'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30 year old secretary from phoenix, arizona.}
<A>__{he looks over at the pantry, where alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door, putting food onto trays.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers...}
<A>__{hitch sees whit lean into view and innocently whisper something into alma's ear making her laugh.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{... how she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off?}
<A>__{hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. he now only has eyes on the pantry ahead. he forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by lew. it is a classic hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat }
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<P>__{(re: the faces of the gossip columnists)}
<D>__{i told you, hitch. this thing's strictly for the drive in crowd.}
<A>__{hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests }
