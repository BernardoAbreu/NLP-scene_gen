<L>__{int farmhouse morning}
<A>__{...the great room of the farmhouse. rustic. cozy. chris snatches up a telephone. there's no dial tone. the line is dead. chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old winchester rifle. he scoops ammo from a drawer into a shoulder bag and runs back outside...}
<L>__{ext farm morning}
<A>__{...where his eyes catch movement in the corral. lucky, entrails spilling, is trying to stand.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{oh, god, rake. oh, jesus, the poor thing's still alive.}
<A>__{chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly reloads the winchester. stepping forward, he aims carefully.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{sorry, old hoss.}
<A>__{blam! a clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal. it takes chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into the trees. the helicopters are no longer in sight, but their thunder remains. they haven't landed yet. chris turns and rushes back to rake's side, only to find... ...he has died. chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time to mourn. he closes rake's eyes. digs through the grass. pulls up a handful of dirt. stuffs it into the old man's hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{the earth keeps us.}
<A>__{conquering his emotions, chris runs to his jeep and jumps in. he shifts into four wheel drive and, ignoring the road, heads straight over the field for the trees. as the jeep disappears, the camera cranes down, zooming}
<B>__{in on...}
<A>__{...one of the farm dogs. the spaniel. not the entire animal, but one of its three separate parts... it's front end... crushed head, bloody neck, and a single broken paw... ...which is trying to crawl. fifty yards away, rake's hand relaxes. the earth spills out through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... pop open.}
