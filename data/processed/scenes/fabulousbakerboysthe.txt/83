<A>__{the next morning. jack is sitting outside the hotel, watching helen and bud wilson pack up the eldorado. the streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal to the car's exterior. after a moment, frank exits with a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a tiny souvenir shot glass.}

<A>__{bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car. frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a madman, trying to catch her. finally, when he gets close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.}
