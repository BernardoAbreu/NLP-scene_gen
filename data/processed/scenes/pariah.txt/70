<L>__{interior laura's kitchen morning}
<A>__{laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the mail. she pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. the return address reads "nys educational & testing services". she flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. the top of the slip reads "'campbell, laura' ged testing results."}
<L>__{exterior bronx home morning}
<A>__{laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a small wooden frame home. the paint is peeling and the flowers in the window box are dead. a rusted metal mailbox next to the door overflows with circulars. laura lifts the circulars out of the box and trashes them. she picks up a discarded fast food bag and tosses it too. a dog barks from a neighboring yard. laura pulls open the screen door and tries to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. more barking. laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. she snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward. laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. laura's mother, 54, and no nonsense opens the door and frowns down at laura through the screen.}

<A>__{laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and advances on the screen door again, holding it out.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{so, i did it. i took the test and }
<A>__{laura's mother slams the door. laura stands on her tiptoes and yells at the diamond shaped window.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{i got my ged!}
<A>__{the lock on the door snaps into place. renewed barking from across the street. silence from the door. laura brushes a fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the mailbox.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{but listen i i gotta go. i gotta get to work but i'ma leave it for you to see. it was nice talking to you.}
<A>__{laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway. she stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch. she yanks the envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket. laura storms off the porch and out of yard, never looking back.}
