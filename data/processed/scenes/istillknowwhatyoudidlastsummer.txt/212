<A>__{julie climbs into bed with a book. the bedroom is clean and orderly. the windows are closed. the closet door is shut. the room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. a stuffed bear sits in a chair. there is a clatter from another room. julie freezes. she waits. she hears it again. she climbs out of bed.}
