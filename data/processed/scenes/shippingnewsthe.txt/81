<L>__{exterior double decker bus, st. john's day}
<A>__{not london, but it might as well be. wavey and quoyle atop a red double decker bus, wind whipping their hair. she is watching the big city flow past, drinking every inch of it. he's watching her.}
<L>__{interior department store day}
<A>__{wavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy pants, picking through a bin of barrettes. quoyle appears with a fistful of neckties. holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a time, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last. well? she shivers with disgust. lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser vative one she's already picked for him. he shivers, just as she did. they share the trace of a grin, just alike. he walks off. ...wavey trying on furry hats in a full length mirror, as quoyle keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. she pouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the hats aren't working. he's staring at her as if nothing else exists in the universe. she knows it. ...wavey alone at a cash register. the checker is ringing up a selection of lacy bras and panties. suddenly, wavey looks up to see quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her purchases. seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of loud boxer shorts he's buying, and waves them at her. she laughs and waves her bras right back. civilians watching think they're in love.}
