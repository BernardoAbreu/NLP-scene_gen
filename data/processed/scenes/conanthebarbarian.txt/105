<L>__{interior fortress throne room night}
<A>__{as conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty, scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber. ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. tamara runs over to her.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{ilira!}
<A>__{she raises ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes. tamara cradles her best friend's face.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{she's dead. it's over.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{before the monks can react, arrows streak out from the darkness, killing them all. only conan is quick enough to dodge his arrow by diving aside. when he comes up, khalar has tamara, his sword at her neck. several archers stand behind him, at the ready.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{it's only begun. because that one was not the heir to acheron.}
<A>__{khalar smiles down at tamara.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{she is.}
<A>__{slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{no. it can't be }
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{secretive, the traitors of acheron. it wasn't easy, but fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. that poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<P>__{(to conan)}
<D>__{and you did the rest, barbarian. my thanks for delivering the queen to me.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{suddenly, a trap door opens beneath conan and drops down in the darkness, landing with a heavy thud.}
