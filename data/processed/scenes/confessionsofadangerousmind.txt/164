<A>__{a hollow eyed barris approaches the building that conceals the tunnel entrance. suddenly there's a commotion on the quiet street. the shaving man is being led handcuffed out of the building by two trench coated men. they shove him into a car. barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. he glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment building. another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows. the car drives away. barris stops at the end of the block, stares at the imposing wall.}
