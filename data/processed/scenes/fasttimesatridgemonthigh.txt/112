<L>__{interior the cold room}
<A>__{there are six examination tables in the "cold room". each of them contains a cadaver covered by a white sheet. mr. vargas has gathered the class around one table in particular. he fingers the edge of the white sheet as he talks.}
<C>__{mr. vargas}
<D>__{as you know, all the bodies in this room are recently deceased human bio structures.}
<A>__{a student raises his hand.}
<C>__{mr. vargas}
<D>__{yes, randy?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{who are these guys?}
<C>__{mr. vargas}
<D>__{most of them were derelicts, randy. they sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money. something like thirty dollars, i believe. isn't that right, doctor miller?}
<C>__{dr. miller}
<D>__{twenty five dollars.}
<B>__{angle on jeff spicoli}
<A>__{who turns to stacy.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{twenty five bucks is pretty good.}
<C>__{mr. vargas}
<D>__{now this gentleman here is named arthur. arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state.}
<A>__{mr. vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and we see the body of arthur. the students' eyes widen. some gasp. others cover their mouths. others begin furious notes. nobody speaks. the body of arthur is smallish and withered. it is orange, flaky, and not quite real looking. a deep cut has been made in arthur's chest. mr. vargas bends arthur upright for a better student view. he gestures to the deep cut made in arthur's chest. the tension mounts.}
<C>__{mr. vargas }
<D>__{this incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state.}
<B>__{angle on arthur}
<A>__{and his shrunken face, which seems to say please don't.}
<C>__{mr. vargas }
<D>__{i want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment.}
<A>__{mr. vargas grabs the two sides of arthur's chest cavity covering, and rips it open.}
<C>__{mr. vargas }
<D>__{here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest.}
<A>__{with a squish, mr. vargas reaches inside arthur and pulls out the human heart for display. the class stands in silent shock. only one comment escapes from any of them.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{bitchin'.}
<B>__{angle on stacy hamilton}
<A>__{who goes running out of the "cold room", holding her mouth. the rat runs after her.}
