<D>__{"birthday girl" screenplay by tom butterworth and jez butterworth}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{in a russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and around. a simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair. around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. she reaches the top of a hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. we float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun.}
<T>__{fade through sun to:}
<A>__{an aerial shot of the rolling english countryside. nothing but fields and trees for miles. the shot describes a panorama before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to move. we fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway. cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour. we fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond. we descend on two young boys in the field. a pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. one of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path and into a suburban garden. we fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden trampoline, to arrive on the patio of john buckingham. he walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing his house, setting down a mug of tea.}

<A>__{a blurred face sharpening into focus, john buckingham, about thirty two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields beyond.}

<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{his hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hello, hello. hello...}
<A>__{he shifts in his chair. coughs. he looks straight at us.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't believe in perfect love. you know, love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh... this is ridiculous.}
<A>__{he removes the microphone. he sits there, thinking very hard.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. no no no. nope.}
<A>__{he stands, turns and stretches.}
<T>__{blackout: fade up:}

<D>__{someone with a sense of humour. someone you can communicate with on the same level. someone you can really talk to. i think communication is key.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{john's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double mattress. an ant runs across the sheet. john squashes it and picks it carefully off.}

<L>__{exterior the garden recording day}
<A>__{we see that john is talking to his pc. it has a small digital camera on the side.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we all have someone in our past who uh... one skeleton, if you like. we've all got at least one person, as it were, under the patio. not literally of course. i suppose i only say this because i always thought people who did this sort of thing were... i had an image that they were losers. not losers. a bit sad. but i think this is the modern world. and i think really it's quite a brave move. quite a brave, reasonable thing to do.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sorry can we start again?}
<T>__{single card on black:}
<C>__{birthday girl}
<A>__{john's fingers in close up, type john buckingham, and his amex number into his pc. finished, he stops, and rests his face on his hands. he hits send. that instant, a worry of black crows bursts up in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air. blackout. music. titles. the titles pop and slide over footage of russian women, on computer video, advertising themselves. they mostly speak in russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in english. the women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, as the titles appear. close ups on mouths and eyes, tight and pixellated. it becomes a wall of image and sound.}

<L>__{interior arrivals gate day}
<A>__{the arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through. john stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the passengers trundle by. we follow one young woman long enough to think this must be her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around by someone else. they've all passed. that's that. she wasn't on the flight. john wanders away from the gate. he stands about in the swirl in the middle of the airport. people bustle by. everyone going somewhere. gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. a woman stands nearby. she is about twenty, very beautiful, tired and laden with luggage.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nadia?}

<A>__{john turns the key in the ignition. the mg wheezes and coughs. he tries again. nothing. the third time it just catches and he coaxes it to life. the colour's drained from his cheeks. they head for the motorway. the silence in the car lasts just long enough for john to feel he is breaking it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's about forty miles from here. i don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to london but it's a city in itself. a roman city. it's a nice house. i'm having a problem with ants. i uh... it's the warmer weather. i can't seem to find the nest. sorry, do you understand "ants"?}
<C>__{nadia}

<C>__{john}

<A>__{suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the speeding car. john panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder amidst loud horn blasts.}
<L>__{exterior hard shoulder day}
<A>__{john navigates his way round the rover in the rain to find her kneeling on the verge, throwing up. he puts a hand on her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy dignity considering what has just happened.}
<L>__{exterior john's close day}
<A>__{it has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing cricket in the road. they clear as a yellow rover pulls into the close, and into the drive of the little house at the end. as john climbs out of his car he eyes the boys. the boys eye him, and his new friend.}
<L>__{interior john's house day}
<A>__{the front door closes behind them. john and nadia stand in the silence of his hallway. there is a small banner hanging there: "welcome nadia". they study the banner together, gravely. eventually he opens a door.}

<A>__{nadia peers around the door to find john standing next to a narrow monk like single bed.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the uh... the other bedroom...}
<A>__{she looks at it, then up at john. she turns and walks out. now she's back, with her camouflaged hold all, dumps it onto the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no hands, starts unpacking. john plugs in the lamp by the bed. to show nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, and then feels stupid.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will get an ashtray.}
<A>__{with john gone, nadia stops unpacking. she walks to the window and stares out over the rooftops of the estate.}

<L>__{interior spare room landing day}
<A>__{nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. we duck straight back out. john composes himself. he puts his head back round the door as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. she's facing away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. it has burnt out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip. he approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. he stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. holding the saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. it takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. unseen by john, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the landing. we stay with her a moment.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a pot of stew, bubbling on the hob.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{john is stirring a pot on the hob. by his expression he might be defusing a bomb. his head cocks, he stiffens. nadia walks right into the kitchen. she's changed, jeans and a tee shirt. nadia takes the spoon from him, says something in russian, gestures for him to sit. she tastes the stew. now she stirs the pot. he watches her.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{john and nadia sit opposite each other. she takes a mouthful. they catch one another's eye. and again. on the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. john can see them, but doesn't move. he puts his fork down.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. your letters were in english. good english. you said you'd studied english.}
<A>__{nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box wrapped in brown paper. she places it in front of him. he warily unwraps a little wooden box. he opens the lid and fishes out a simple gold ring. he holds it in his palm.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't take this.}
<A>__{he puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear. she fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to take.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't take it. i'm not really a ring guy.}
<A>__{she takes his hand. he automatically yanks it away like he's been burned. she takes his hand again and to stop it becoming unbearable, he allows nadia to push the ring onto his ring finger. it goes on easily.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. no big deal. thank you. yes thanks. thank you.}
<L>__{interior lounge night}
<A>__{john and nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching t.v. john's gaze seems to go through the t.v. and a thousand yards beyond. nadia is knitting a half finished jumper, blood red. john stands and disappears out of shot.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{if anyone gets this message please call as soon as possible. it's an emergency.}
<A>__{john sits back down. he steals side glances at her. her mouth. her red painted fingers knitting fast. john flips through the channels the money programme. antique's roadshow. cup rugby. eventually he offers nadia the remote control. she takes, aims it at the t.v. but doesn't press it. just as it seems she won't, she does: university challenge. they watch university challenge with nadia still aiming the control and smoking. after another long pause she flips the button the money programme. antiques roadshow. rugby. she flips again then hands the controls back to john and they watch university challenge. nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns.}
<L>__{interior lounge stairs night}
<A>__{nadia climbs the stairs. john watches her, hovering in the doorway of the darkened lounge. he hears the bathroom door close before venturing up.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{john sits on the edge of his bed. he cocks his head: door opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door closing. silence. he squeezes his door open and peers down the dark landing. the coast is clear.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{brushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection. spits. finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, and gives a small shout. nadia is standing right outside the door; nightshirt, damp hair, toothbrush in her mouth.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he squeezes past and quick steps down the landing.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{he climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the light and lies there in the moonlight. after twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open. john climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you should go now. we'll talk in the morning.}
<A>__{his eyes widen but he can't speak. he wants to but she's placed her hand across his mouth. she reaches down and takes his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts. she unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside. he's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his mouth. her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip his fly. he lets out a moan. we concentrate on their faces. above the silence all we can hear is john's breathing before long nadia looks down he's come. nadia turns and walks out, leaving john marooned, gasping in and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers.}

<L>__{exterior countryside day}
<A>__{john jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. his breath billows around him in the sharp morning air. he stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill. he doubles up to recover, panting hard.}
<L>__{interior john's garden day}
<A>__{two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast left on the lawn. john climbs heavily back over his fence. there's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of breakfast. some glossy russian magazines, a full ashtray, nadia's knitting. the patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing. he scans the garden jumpily. the boy next door is on his trampoline, bouncing up and down, watching john at the top of each bounce.}
<L>__{interior john's house day}
<A>__{sweating from the run, john peers up the stairs. the house is silent. in the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a number.}

<L>__{interior nadia's room day}
<A>__{john flicks through a stack of photographs. one of nadia as a young girl in a meadow, with binoculars around her neck john looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him. he turns them over in his hands. he looks through them. he slowly lowers them. he's seen something. he stands and crosses the room. on the mantelpiece, in a silver frame, is his picture, cut from the brochure. he holds it in his hands. the shower has stopped. in a panic he replaces the picture, the photographs, the gun lighter, the brochure, and the binoculars.}

"nadia...?" john sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, listening to nadia breathe. close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a round a woman's wrist. pull back to a close up of nadia's face, her eyes fixed on john. john running by the river. john watches nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the room. he stares out the window. nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully. nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and attaching them to suspenders. the street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks over the close. rain coming down in john's garden. the pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. john has his hands out as nadia is winding red wool it into a ball. the jumper is half finished. the rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. john in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. he sips his half, half listening to the conversation. it all seems so dull. he finishes his drink and looks at his watch. they ask him if he's staying for another. a knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly finished jumper. nadia kneels over john holding the knitting needles. she presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck. his eyes are fixed on hers. close up on nadia's face. her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half buried in a pillow. we can just make out john behind, on top of her. both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat. catching her breath nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. she snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom. the guitar theme ends.}

<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{great. you've split my fuckin, lip.}
<A>__{john lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the english words. exhausted, john stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. the whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has the strength to go on. nadia staggers into the bathroom where she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. john lies on the bed listening to her cry.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. this took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. but, you see, i'm not in that line of work anymore. nowadays i'm a bank robber.}

<A>__{john takes another step down the hallway. there, by the door are the two guitar cases full of money. next to them is nadia's bag. crouching, john opens the bag and searches inside. he finds what he is looking for; the silver cigarette lighter pistol. we hear the russian lovers' voices next door. john is absolutely terrified, breathing hard and shaking, holding the little gun.}
<L>__{interior alexei's suite night}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{you still love me? eh? of course you do. come here. yuri won't be here for a while. come on babe.}
<A>__{he takes his shirt off nadia glances up with horror, she sees john in the doorway. alexei turns to see john stand by the door, holding a little silver gun.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{john and nadia look at each other.}
<C>__{alexei}

<A>__{he looks at the little gun.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{that's that cigarette lighter i gave you isn't it?}
<A>__{alexei stands. john takes a step back. alexei walks calmly towards john and throws a punch. it catches john right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast.}
<C>__{nadia}

<C>__{nadia}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{he looks at nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing the knife at him. he suddenly looks completely punctured. john has struggled up again and stands behind him. they are both looking at nadia.}

<D>__{what. you're what? you're with this creep now.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{leave him!}

<A>__{nadia stares back at him. the seconds pass. she speaks in a whisper.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i will kill you if you try.}
<A>__{in the impasse, john picks up a lamp and hurls it at alexei's head. it is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short. in the confusion. alexei grabs nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. he grabs the knife, just as john brains him with one of the guitars. it emits a fruity final chord.}
<L>__{interior hotel corridor alexei's suite night}
<A>__{whistling, yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on the door of alexei's and enters. we walk with him down the hallway into the bedroom to find alexei, heartbroken, tied and bound to a desk chair. yuri murmurs something in russian.}

<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<A>__{she carefully places tape across his mouth. almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss his cheek. the 'kiss' suddenly makes alexei's eyes widen in pain. as she stands her lips are bloody. she's bitten him on the cheek. a single streak of blood runs from the gash.}
<C>__{nadia}
<P>__{(to john)}
