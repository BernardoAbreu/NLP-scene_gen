<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{we can do this. we can get her out of here.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{have you completely lost your mind? so you get her out of here. so you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{nobody knows she's here. i called her personally. nobody knows.}
<C>__{fisher}

<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{oh god. this is insane.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{what's insane is the fact that michael here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. that's insane.}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{they'll get us on accessory to murder.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{bullshit it's not accessory. i didn't do shit. you call the cops, you explain it was an accident...}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{her fucking head was caved in.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so! i didn't fucking do it!}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{she's got bondage burns on her wrists. there's blow all over the room, moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. this room looks like the manson family stayed here a month. michael goes down, we all go down.}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{i'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{that's a horrible ugly comment. "dead whore?" she's a person!}

<B>__{silence.}
<C>__{boyd}
<P>__{(unflappably calm)}
<D>__{lets take a vote. a simple vote. two choices; we clean up the mess. right now. bury it in the desert, go home, and never look back. or, we can call the police... open those doors, roll the dice and hope that it's only michael who falls. let's take a vote. desert... or police?}
<A>__{boyd looks around. beat. raises his hand.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{desert.}

<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{good god... good god...}
<A>__{all eyes on adam. he takes a while... finally,}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how do we get her out of here?}
<A>__{a reasonable question. boyd thinks. beat.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{wrap her up in blankets. bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car... done.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{we check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what about the blood?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{someone goes to walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, spic and span, the works.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{have you ever done this before?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{the reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. what are we left with? what? a 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point a to point b. now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. but that line exists and i see it. i see that line. trust me. adam. trust me... i can take care of this.}
<B>__{knock knock}
<A>__{the five men stop breathing. somebody's at the door.}
<B>__{knock knock}
<A>__{stunned silence. the guys stare at each other in horror.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{hello? is anyone in there?}
<A>__{boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole. boyd's pov, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a man. ralph, early 30's, fairly unassuming.}
<C>__{boyd}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{ah, yeah, hi. is tina there?}
<A>__{adam throws his head in his hands.}
<C>__{boyd}
<P>__{(through door)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{i'm with tina. is she there?}
<A>__{boyd indicates to the guys to be cool.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{she's not here.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{she's here. she's just... hold on a second.}
<A>__{boyd turns as the guys freak. crazed bits of panicked conversation gibberish.}
<B>__{knock knock.}
<C>__{ralph }
<D>__{could you open the door please.}
<A>__{boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. ralph steps in. takes a good look around. ralph's pov of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five severely traumatized men.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{okay. hi.}
<B>__{silence.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{so who's the lucky guy?}
<B>__{pause.}

<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{doing the bachelor party thing?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{sin city. devil's playground. the black bitch. all day every day.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where's tina?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{she's in the bathroom... she's still working.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{she's still working?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{sweet deal.}
<A>__{silence. ralph checks the rest of the guys. some strange eye contact. extremely uncomfortable.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{is everything okay?}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{great. fine. perfect.}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{ralph}
<P>__{(indicating bathroom)}
<D>__{i'm gonna just tell her i'm waiting.}
<A>__{he starts for the bathroom.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{she's in there!}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{i'm just gonna let her know i'm here.}
<A>__{and ralph is on his way to the bathroom. and the guys are freaking as ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the bathroom. hand on door opening door stepping in and ralph sees tina. ralph, in shock, staring, back peddles...}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{my god!}
<A>__{as ralph starts to turn }
<C>__{fisher }
<D>__{no! noooo!!!}
<A>__{on boyd his boy scout knife raised above his head driving it into ralph's neck! major arterial spray as ralph's jugular is severed. ralph struggles. boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{help me! don't let him bleed on the carpet!}
<A>__{and moore is there. helping boyd wrestle the screaming thrashing ralph into the bathroom. ralph fights like a gilled marlin. they shove him into the bathroom. boyd slams the door shut. holds it tight as ralph tries to force it back open.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{he'll bleed out! he'll bleed dry. help me hold the door.}
<A>__{and help they do. michael, moore and adam all hold the door shut as ralph continues to fight for his life. slowly the force of his pounding eases. we hear ralph slowing down... the thrashing slows... softer... the moans quiet... softer... just a slight gurgle... ralph is going... going... ralph is gone.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. devastating silence as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of developments... with fisher staring, blotto.}
