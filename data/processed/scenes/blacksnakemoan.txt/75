<L>__{interior lazarus' home day}
<A>__{rae flinches and flails. she falls to the floor.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{hold on, now. hold on!}
<A>__{rae's eyes are open and filled with fear. she struggles to flee as laz holds her in place, trying to reassure her.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{now, i ain't gonna hurt'cha. calm down, miss.}
<P>__{(she fights, coughs)}
<D>__{listen... listen... listen now, gal!}
<P>__{(rae settles in his grip)}
<D>__{i ain't gonna hurt ya, hear? gotta get you well. now, look me... hey! look me in the eye.}
<A>__{rae is too weak to talk or move. laz clutches her small face in his dark hands.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{open your eyes. go'on, now. you need to see, ain't no harm here. ain't no harm.}
<P>__{(rae calms)}
<D>__{my name is lazarus woods. and i ain't gonna let you die.}
<A>__{rae's eyes roll back. lazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and forward. her mouth opens. in her sickened state, with the force of something evil and deep inside, rae clasps her open mouth over laz's. a shriek sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter, allowing the kiss to grow in intensity. rae falls to her stomach as laz abruptly stands and stumbles across the room. what he sees chills him to the bone. rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed a rant of raspy words pour from her mouth.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{...you don't... touch me... s'no... no! mm mm... mm mmmmmmmmmmmmm! n n'you fuck!}
<A>__{lazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing. he looks to the mantle. his weathered bible lies in a coat of dust. he picks it up as a wave of the burning hits rae. she clutches her breast and crotch, rolling from side to side.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{mm mm... mm mm... ma muh... ma muh!}
<P>__{(sudden anger, shouting)}
<D>__{see... s... see if'i give... give'a... shit...}
