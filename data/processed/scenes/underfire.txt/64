<L>__{exterior the front of the cathedral dusk}
<A>__{the three sandinistas, pedro, and price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance. the sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. it seems safe. the door opens; the priest lets claire out. for a moment she looks around to see who's still alive in the shadows price looks like one of the guerrillas. they see each other and embrace briefly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're okay?}
<A>__{the sandinistas seem to relax. the sandinistas take pride in pedro and pat his left arm for price and claire.}
<D>__{sandinista #1 san dee koufax, no? sandinista #2 si, koufax. sandinista #3 es mejor que koufax, eh?!}
<A>__{they seem to want approval from the americans.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{much better than koufax.}
<A>__{the sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the american gesture. the six start walking across the plaza away from the church. in the b.g. we see piles of bodies burning; the red cross tends to the wounded locals. spirits are high as they walk. the tiny red light glows on claire's recorder.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{koufax is okay... but tippy martinez, he is the best... he pitches for the baltimore orioles, and some day i will be the second man from nicaragua to play in the major leagues... sandinista #1}
<P>__{(to price and claire)}
<D>__{tippy martinez had a good fastball, but pedro has a curveball and a screwball that are better.}
<A>__{all five of them agree that pedro is the best; they slap his valued arm and relax for the first time all day.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{you will give my autographed baseball to tippy and tell him in five years i will be pitching with him, okay? he better watch out for me, eh?}
