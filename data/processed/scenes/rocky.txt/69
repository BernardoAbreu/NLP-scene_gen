<C>__{commentator}
<D>__{would you give us a demonstration?}
<A>__{rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with incredible intensity... everyone present is taken aback. rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his hands dripping beef blood. the commentator is unnerved and rocky looks straight into the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.}
