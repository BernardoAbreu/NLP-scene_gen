<D>__{and where is the list vulnerable?}
<A>__{there is nervous silence for a moment. behind kittridge, on the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. an agent gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the room.}
<C>__{kittridge }
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{other than here.}
<A>__{nervous laughter goes around the table. it fades. on the other side of the room, the agent who answered the phone turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. he holds the phone out to kittridge, terrified, the bearer of extremely bad news. they all turn slowly and look at him. he holds the phone out to kittridge, shaking slightly.}
