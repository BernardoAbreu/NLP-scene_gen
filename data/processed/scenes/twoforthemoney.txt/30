<L>__{interior walter abrams' office day}
<A>__{walter smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an assistant in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones. across the room, a large wall is filled with tvs, each turned to a different channel, no sound.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i will hire the trainers too... well run it by them, you won't know until you try... so, they can stay the night. i will put 'em up at the plaza, nice suite, park view... okay double it... triple it... everything's about money. look, on sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again. she loves elephants. your circus has 10, i only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands. (beat, icy edge) i don't need parenting advice from a guy who doubles as a clown. i want an elephant and i will pay. what'll it take to grease your wheels and get one this weekend? hello?... hello?" fuck wad! (intercom his assistant, furious) find ringling brothers! get me on the horn with someone who understands profit! walter sees brandon. something new. full focus. he removes the headset. dons his glasses. circles around.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{whoa, look at you. the marlboro man. (feeling his bicep) jesus you're in great shape.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i've been in better.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(assessing brandon as he speaks ) modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity. there are rules to success, brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you know and know what you don't know and know i gotta know everything you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner! smile. c'mon! what the hell is that? i said smile. bigger. hungrier. more teeth. ever sell before?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{if you can sell you'll never starve. ever speak in public? perform? anything like that?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i played quarterback in college. division one.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i know, i'm talking about not in uniform.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i used to sing at church.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{oh really? so you're religious?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't know. i guess.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{certain things, you either are or you aren't. which is it?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{when i was a kid i thought i wanted to be a pastor... obviously not now. i mean, yeah, i believe in god.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{relax. what do i care? besides, it's against the law to hire based on religious orientation. you're not a republican are you? just kidding. (silent beat, staring at him) you're scaring me son. what's with the deer caught in headlights vibe? you were a quarterback for god's sake. a leader.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{that was six years ago.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{c'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. you think i went to college? i'm autodidactic. big word, huh? know what it means? self taught. partially by reading, sure, but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions. i swear to god i'm looking at myself 30 years ago. a taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable. walter crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things. it's bad for my condition. so before i die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in vegas?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, i mean we got}
