<A>__{morning light filters through the half open blinds. dust particles in the shafts of light. it's still and empty. gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. gittes moves toward it. it is grotesque. when he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. gittes walks on into the kitchen.}
