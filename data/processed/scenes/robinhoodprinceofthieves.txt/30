<L>__{exterior forest clearing day}
<A>__{a large tree trunk spans a swift flowing river. the ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. stop in their tracks. robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this is my bridge. no one crosses without paying tax.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{just bugger off, mate, huh?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{if you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{ain't i hurt you a bloody nuff for one day?}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{if he's in a hurry to end his mortal misery, help him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you don't have the courage to face me again, john little? or should i call you 'little john'?}
<A>__{john grabs a hefty, gnarled staff. strides to the bridge.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{alright, m'old cock. you wanna nuther good wallopin'?}
<A>__{his confidence melting, robin glances back at duncan and aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. john storms at robin. staffs thrash. driven back, robin connects a blow on john's foot. the giant is off balance. robin follows up. lands a couple to the ribs. john responds with heavy swings, which robin blocks deftly. back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. john chuckles with every swing. enjoying the time of his life. their staffs lock. it's strength against strength. robin is no match. with one mighty thrust, john hurtles him into the stream. the woodsmen cheer loudly. aslan watches impassively. robin scrambles back onto the bridge. john waits, grinning.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{lil' wet behind the ears, mate?}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{don't fool with him. get him!}
<A>__{john charges. robin fends him off, gets in some shots of his own. john swings in a giant arc. robin ducks. john loses balance and falls to his knees. robin allows him time to right himself. john comes at him again, pummeling. wood splinters from the impact. brute force versus agility. agility is beginning to prevail, when robin's staff splits in two.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{swimmin' time again, ol' chum.}
<A>__{the coup de grace. lands heavily. robin teeters. falls. disappears under the foaming water... does not re emerge. john waits. the spectators rush to the bank. no sign.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{bloomin' shame. 'e were a brave 'un.}
<A>__{suddenly robin arcs up out of the water. his hands clamp onto john's ankles. robin heaves with all his might. john topples headfirst into the water. surfaces in panic.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{help! cain't bloody swim.}
<A>__{he submerges again. robin pulls his head above water.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{do you yield?}
<A>__{the terrified giant sputters. goes under again, flailing with arms and legs. robin holds his head just above the surface.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{do you yield?}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{good. now put your feet down.}
<A>__{john struggles, then his feet hit bottom... the water only reaches his chest.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{i will be buggered.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{pay me the tax.}
<A>__{a tense pause while all wait for little's reaction.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{robin hood, ya got balls o' solid rock.}
<A>__{he hands robin back the medallion. chuckling loudly, he swoops robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.}
