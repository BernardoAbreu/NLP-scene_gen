<L>__{exterior the old abandoned road early morning}
<A>__{in the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones of the abandoned road. the ancient bridge spans the black river, idling toward the sea. it is a perfect day, tranquil except for the faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. as it grows louder and louder, a flock of birds is frightened from the trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll from the vibration. rounding the bend of the road into view are a half dozen kids on bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible carnival parade or is it a funeral procession? long, short, tall, fat vehicles; the stretch out car, the cab towing portable toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the cortez camper dressing rooms, the stake bed loaded with reflectors rattling like radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage german army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the huge, bright yellow construction crane on its caterpillar treads, its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning hard on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump a few technicians straddle it having their morning danish and coffee. in the midst of these, on a low slung flatbed trailer rides the duesenberg the coffin on its caisson. the caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the a.d., astride the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.}

<A>__{the second a.d.'s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers, snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric horns.}
