<A>__{rochester has stood bertha at his desk. a case of jewels is open before her. she has put on a tiara, a diamond necklace, bracelets. she is gazing at a ruby brooch. she turns to rochester. his expression is calm, resigned. bertha begins to laugh. she takes the candelabra from the table. she admires herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers, the jewels. she holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight. rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. as she passes, rochester realises he is bleeding. she has run the brooch pin across him.}
