<L>__{interior elementary school hallway day}
<A>__{kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her classroom. through the glass she sees mr. davies. he notices kate and smiles (the concerned smile you give someone right after they've publicly embarrassed themselves). kate mouths the words }
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(silent)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{ and gestures "come here." mr. davies gestures to the class that he'll be right back before he walks out to talk to kate. he's got a slightly nervous demeanor somewhere between "i never became comfortable talking to women" and asperger's.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{is everything, um...okay, mrs. hannah?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yeah, well...i'm really embarrassed but i feel a lot better. and i just wanted to say thank you.}
<A>__{mr. davies glances down the hall.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{look i'm not a fool.}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{i know you were drinking this morning.}
<A>__{kate looks shocked.}
<C>__{mr. davies }
<D>__{i saw you.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{oh, no, i...}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i know that! oh, god, i...}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{...listen i'm not actually pregnant.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm just really hung over. the kids started asking me questions after i vomited and i panicked.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{oh. that's...not good.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i know. i...please don't say anything.}
<A>__{mr. davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{just...go home. get some sleep.}
<A>__{before kate can say a word, mr. davies heads back into the classroom.}
