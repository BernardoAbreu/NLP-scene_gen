<L>__{interior gattaca computer complex. night.}
<A>__{in the dimly lit, empty computer complex, jerome takes a last look around. he sits at his computer, one final time replaying the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that he is on the eve of taking for real. he notices the key missing from his keyboard. instantly realizing the significance, he rises from his seat to flee.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{vincent }
<A>__{jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name and the voice that calls it. he makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his pursuer. the investigator steps out of the shadows.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{vincent, what are you running from?}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(disturbingly calm)}
<D>__{from vincent.}
<A>__{the two men face each other for the first time in a long time. the investigator is transfixed by jerome's face scarcely able to believe his eyes.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{has it been so long, you don't remember who i am?}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(nodding to the investigator's badge)}
<D>__{maybe it's}
<A>__{you who's forgotten.}
<P>__{(meeting his gaze)}
<D>__{what are you doing here, anton?}
<A>__{it is finally apparent the investigator is jerome's younger brother anton [as we shall refer to the investigator for the rest of the film].}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i could ask}
<A>__{you the same question.}
<P>__{(glancing to the impressive complex)}
<D>__{i have a}
<A>__{right to be here, you don't. jerome smiles at him condescendingly.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{you almost sound like you believe that.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(ignoring the remark, extending his hand)}
<D>__{come with me now, vincent. you've gone as far as you can go.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(refusing anton's hand, glancing to the telescope above them)}
<D>__{there are a few million miles to go yet.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{it's over.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{is that the only way you can succeed, anton, to see me fail?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{it's for the best.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(increasingly angered)}
<D>__{god, even}
<A>__{you want to tell me what i can't do.}
<D>__{in case you hadn't noticed, anton, i don't need rescuing. but}
<A>__{you did, once. anton is clearly stung by the memory.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(goading)}
<D>__{well? you have all the answers. how is that possible?}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(resolute)}
<D>__{you didn't beat me that day. i beat}
<A>__{myself}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{who are you trying to convince?}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i will prove it to you. come swim with me now, vincent. now tonight.}
<A>__{jerome regards anton with a knowing smile. somewhere in gattaca a phone rings.}
