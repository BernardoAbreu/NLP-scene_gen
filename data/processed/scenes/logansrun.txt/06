<A>__{(titles end) close up crystal (insert) clear, sparkling, flower like. camera pulls back to reveal}
<L>__{interior nursery corridor}
<A>__{the crystal is in the hand of a sleeping infant who is behind glass in one of many cubicles. standing outside, looking in, logan, dimly lit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant lies, swaddled and coccooned in the rosy auto tender which caters to the baby's every need. faint music bubbles like distant laughter.}
<B>__{out logan}
<A>__{logan is twenty five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of austere grace. he is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery window into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles three sleeping infants. logan is knocking on the soundless glass.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{wake up...come on, logan 6.}
<B>__{francis}
<A>__{entering .}
<C>__{francis}

<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(still knocking on the soundless glass)}
<D>__{turn this way.}
<P>__{(as one of the infants stirs, smiles, bubbles)}
<D>__{no, no...not you...you!}
<A>__{francis tries to pull logan away from the window, but logan is intent on waking one of the infants.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you should've seen me take my last runner...perfect.}
<P>__{(logan continues to pound the soundless glass)}
<D>__{i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated...his hand...}
<P>__{(breaks off as logan is paying no attention)}
<D>__{so now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(to infant)}
<D>__{open your eyes once, idiot.}
<P>__{(to francis)}
<D>__{it's not every day that a sandman son is born. i'm telling you, francis that's him!}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{maybe, maybe not. what's the difference? come on, logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.}
<A>__{but logan isn't moving. francis gets an idea.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{okay...you really want to wake him up?}
<A>__{francis starts to pry at the panel...knowing it will sound an}
<B>__{alarm.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{hey, cut that out !}
<A>__{too late: there is a sound of alarm chimes. the area in which they stand is bathed in a violet glow. logan grabs francis firmly and stops him from prying at the panel:}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{now you've done it...}
<A>__{the chimes stop...but the glow continues, a metallic voice is heard:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{break in scanners report intrusion, identify.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{logan 5...francis 7, authorized duty quadrant. intrusion accidental.}
<C>__{voice}

<A>__{the violet light goes off.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(with affection: to logan)}
<D>__{had enough?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(looking at the infant)}
<D>__{even the alarm didn't wake him.}
<A>__{as francis starts out:}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(one last look; joining francis)}
<D>__{all right, francis...i'm with you.}
<A>__{they move off down the corridor...the lights behind them dimming as they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, children automatically tended. chimes...soft. a lullaby and a soothing impersonal voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{sleep time...go to sleep. sleeping time, little ones.}
<A>__{as they exit nursery...logan stops and takes one final look backward.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you need a lift. let's go to arcade and celebrate...}
<P>__{(teasing tone)}
<D>__{your alert successor...logan 6.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly)}
<D>__{not in my time...}
<A>__{they move through the door which closes.}
