<A>__{we stay on miguel for the game's highlights, jump cutting his reactions to the best plays of the game. play 1: he casually spits sunflower seed shells, then claps the final out of the inning, high fiving players returning to the dugout. play 2: chats to jorge, when they react to the crack of the bat, leap to their feet, eagerly anticipate an umpire's call, and cheer when the call goes their team's way. play 3: grimaces at the sight of a hit by pitch. play 4: leaps to his feet, claps. play 5: leaps to his feet, doesn't clap. sits back down. play 6: miguel and jorge sway to the seventh inning stretch classic "take me out to the ball game." play 7: sitting with brad, they both point to something on the field and crack up laughing. of course, we don't see what they're laughing at. play 8: standing with jorge and the rest of the players, the mood is tense. the players react to a hit ball, as their heads jerk toward the outfield, waiting, waiting, waiting, and... celebration! whatever happened, the game is over and we follow the players out onto the field to mob brad, who just scored the winning run.}
