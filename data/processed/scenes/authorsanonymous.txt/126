<A>__{henry sits at the table in the bookstore, graciously and happily signing copies of his book for the short line of people waiting. this is his moment, the one that brought him all the way from illinois. he has arrived. as a person. as a writer. henry looks up. eudora is nestled comfortably in a nearby leather chair, reading away. she looks up. they make eye contact. her smile is all the encouragement henry needs. all that he will ever need. he reaches for the next book to sign.}
