<L>__{exterior a beach near a powerplant. day}
<A>__{billy leans against the wall of a concession stand. his knuckles are cut. a cut over his eye. he is agitated. smoking. a car pulls up and queenan and dignam get out of it. in appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing billy.}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{hey. let's go through the routine.}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{you think you can pop someone. there's no special card to play. the guy whose jaw you broke was boston police department.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm going fuckin' nuts. i can't be someone else every day.}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{most of the people in the world do it every day. what's the big deal?}
<A>__{dignam is drinking coffee.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm not them.}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{you're nobody. you signed the paper. we're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. maybe we'll just erase your file.}
<A>__{this is billy's deepest fear.}
<C>__{dignam }
<D>__{and zip, you're a soldier for costello, open to arrest for how many felonies? maybe we'll do that.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{maybe i will fucking kill you.}
<A>__{he gets free of dignam and punches him.}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{easy now. that was a joke, billy.}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.}
<A>__{the fight. queenan grabs billy and holds him against the wall.}
<C>__{queenan}
<P>__{(gently, like a man calming a wild animal)}
<D>__{be smart. if someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you?}
<A>__{billy looks desperately inland. revere beach condominium buildings. a thousand empty terraces, five thousand empty windows. billy is desperate.}
<C>__{queenan }
<D>__{get in the car.}
<A>__{they do.}
<C>__{queenan }
<D>__{keep your act together. it's just a little while longer.}
<A>__{billy nods, out of it. dignam is looking at blood on his hands in disbelief.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{when are you going to take costello? what's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. get him for pissing in the street.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{what, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{well. that would stick...}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{you shut up. we're building a case. it takes time. you know that.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{there's something wrong.}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{maybe. maybe.}
<C>__{dignam}
<D>__{keep your ears opened. no bullshit.}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{i want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the special investigation unit.}
<P>__{(billy looks at him)}
<D>__{you hear anything like that?}
<A>__{billy shakes his head.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{jesus h. christ.}
<C>__{queenan}
<D>__{hang tight for me. just a little longer. we're this close.}
<A>__{billy nods reluctantly.}
<C>__{billy}
