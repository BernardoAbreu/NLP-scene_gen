<L>__{interior jp's private room night}
<B>__{blackness}
<A>__{a click is heard off and the room is lit, revealing jp by the door, his finger by the light switch. he smiles into the room and walks in, looking behind as terri hesitates by the door.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{terri moves past him. jp locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket. terri registers this. jp calms her.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{not a good neighborhood. people disappear. (a beat) feel like home? it's just like you left it.}
<A>__{terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously. she registers the pillar.}
<B>__{angle on pillar}
<A>__{it's plainly different from the last time terri saw it but despite what the audience knows about it it still seems inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{not quite. this wasn't here.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{no. but, as you can see, i'm having some work done on it. you found a real treasure for me, terri. i hope i can show you how grateful i am.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{yeah ... yeah, it looks different.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{yeah, a girl i know helped smarten it up. put her heart and soul into it.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{a girl? anyone i should know?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{not now, no. i mean now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what i mean?}
<A>__{jp has been cruising the room as they speak. now he's standing close to the pillar. terri is still some distance from him.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{yeah right. look ...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{terri, listen. (a beat) why don't you come here and kiss me? i mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? is it going to happen? isn't it going to happen? let's get it out of the way. see how we feel. then we can relax. talk. you know.}
<A>__{a pause a tense one for the audience who know that jp has obviously decided who pinhead's next meal is. terri looks at jp, half suspicious, half attracted.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i don't think so. not yet. i'm not ready yet.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{sure. sure. i understand. it's cool. i mean, we've got all night.}
<A>__{jp smiles winningly and warmly. a nice guy. a nice smile. a smile a girl can trust. the pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and silent, waiting for the sacrifice.}
