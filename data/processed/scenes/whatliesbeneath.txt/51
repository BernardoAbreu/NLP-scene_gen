<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{claire walks in carrying a half empty bottle of wine. she looks over at jody, who turns off the lights. jody then strikes a match and lights a large candle. she unveils her carved antique ouija board.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{sit down here.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(nervous, jokey)}
<D>__{are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?}
<A>__{jody turns to her, deadly serious.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{isn't this where you saw her?}
<A>__{claire's smile fades. she nods.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{then this is where she'll be.}
<A>__{they sit cross legged, the board between them.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{place your fingers on the planchette.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{the planchette?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{jody indicates the wooden pointing device. each woman grasps an edge.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur.}
<P>__{(to claire)}
<D>__{what's her first name?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{jody closes her eyes. claire follows suit.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i call forth the entity that is haunting this house.}
<A>__{they look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{mrs. feur?}
<A>__{there's still no movement.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{nothing's happening.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{jody focuses intently.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{reveal yourself to us.}
<A>__{a long moment passes. it's starting to seem like a bust. suddenly, the candle flares. even jody seems startled.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(to the spirit)}
<D>__{who...who are you?}
<A>__{at first, nothing happens. then, slowly, the planchette starts to move across the board.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{are you doing that?}
<A>__{jody shakes her head.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'm not doing that.}
<A>__{the planchette comes to rest on the letter "m." moments later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on "e."}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh...}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{m e...}
<A>__{it starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space between "e" and "f." the planchette stops on "f." jody removes her fingers from the device.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{mef? what's mef?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's initials. f is feur. it's her.}
<A>__{suddenly, the candle starts flickering strangely and the planchette slides jerkily on its own...m e f, m e f...}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{jody stumbles backwards, gasping.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<A>__{claire leans in.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(to ghost)}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<A>__{the candle goes out.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{jody bolts. claire follows.}
