<L>__{exterior wasteland cave dusk}
<A>__{eli and solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a flickering campfire. the prairie dog roasts on a spit. eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out clean. it's done. he clasps his hands together and gazes down penitently at the ground.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. amen.}
<A>__{eli carves off a piece of meat. juicy and succulent. he bites into it, teasing solara by making a show of how good it tastes. he feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder. solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what does that taste like?}
<A>__{he takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{tastes like chicken.}
<A>__{she tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't. she reaches out and tears off a piece. sniffs at it, takes a small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. eli smiles. as she eats, she gestures toward eli's saint christopher.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's a saint christopher medal.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{who's saint christopher? is he a character from your book?}
<A>__{eli smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. he wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. so he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. he was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry.}
<A>__{solara listens, rapt. eli is a good storyteller.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. he was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. the boy explained that he was the son of god, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. after that, christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. and that's how he became a sainterior later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what is a saint, anyway?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. enough that god himself took a special interest in them.}
<A>__{solara looks at eli tenderly, with admiration.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{someone like you.}
<A>__{eli looks away, down at the ground. he appears sad.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no. not like me. saints ain't killers. and i done too much of that. spilled too much blood.}
<A>__{beat. no words, just the flickering firelight.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{will you read me some more from the book?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's late. you should get some sleep. maybe tomorrow.}
<A>__{later night the fire down to its last embers. eli sleeps next to his pack, half hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. his hat and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword. solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. not asleep after all. she looks over at eli his face hidden in shadow and so impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{eli?}
<A>__{no response. quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his side. she opens his coat and checks the pockets. empty. she goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing, stealthily frisking him. she finds something on his lapel, hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop. it's a rectangular plastic badge. the red, white and blue colors faded and worn. it reads:}
<D>__{welcome to wal mart}
<C>__{my name is "eli"}
<D>__{how may i help you?}
<A>__{she stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of it. then moves on, continuing to pat him down. whatever she's looking for is not here. she turns her attention to the backpack. slowly, carefully, opens it up. there it is. the bible, wrapped carefully in its neat little package of cloth and twine. she reaches in for it. suddenly, eli's hand shoots out and grabs her by the wrist. she cries out, startled. eli sits up, his face just a dark shape in the shadows. for the first time he appears a little scary to solara.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you scared me! i thought you were asleep.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{on the road you sleep with one eye open. i asked you what you were doing.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i just wanted to see the book.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to see the book, you ask me. nobody touches it but me. ever. until it gets where it's going. do you understand?}
<A>__{he's very forceful. she nods, a little afraid of him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{tell me you understand!}
<A>__{he grips her wrist tighter.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{okay! i understand! ow!}
<A>__{eli releases her wrist. takes the pack from her and closes it up. pulls it closer to him and lies back down.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's no use to you anyway. you don't know how to read it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{well... now we have the time, maybe you can teach me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{maybe. get some sleep.}
<A>__{she lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes. she just lies there, watching him.}
