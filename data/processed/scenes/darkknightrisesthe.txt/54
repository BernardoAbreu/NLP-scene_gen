<L>__{interior study, wayne manor moments later}
<A>__{blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. wayne enters.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what can i do for you, officer?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{commissioner gordon's been shot.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that }
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{he chased a gunman down into the sewers. when i pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. a masked man called 'bane'.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{i did. one of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. he needs you. he needs the batman.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{if commissioner gordon thinks i'm the batman he must be in a bad way }
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{he doesn't know or care who you are. (off look.) but we've met before. when i was a kid. at the orphanage. see, my mom died when i was small. car accident, i don't really remember it. but a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. i remember that just fine. (looks at wayne.) not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? to be angry. in your bones. people understand, foster parents understand. for a while. then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. to move on. to forget.}
<A>__{wayne stares at blake.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{so they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home st. swithin's. used to be funded by the wayne foundation. see, i figured it out too late. you have to hide the anger. practice smiling in the mirror. like putting on a mask. you showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.}
<C>__{blake }
<D>__{we were so excited bruce wayne, billionaire orphan. we made up stories about you. legends. the other boys' stories were just that. but when i saw you i knew who you really were... (beat.) i'd seen that look on your face. same one i taught myself.}
<A>__{blake gets up to leave. wayne is lost in thought.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{i don't know why you took the fall for dent's murder, but i'm still a believer in the batman. even if you're not.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the wayne foundation?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{because the money stopped. might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. some of those details might need your help.}
