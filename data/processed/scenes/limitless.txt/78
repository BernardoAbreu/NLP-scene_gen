<D>__{armed with vern's last 800 dollars, i made 4000 in a day.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was too slow. time day cut to:}
<A>__{eddie, differently dressed, surrounded by stacks of research, again keying away...}

<L>__{interior a coffee shop day}
<A>__{eddie sits across from a sinister looking young russian in his early 30's. this is gennady.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{the two men stare at each other.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{because i don't see you before. and i don't fucking like you already. why do i give you 100 thousand dollars?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{because i quintupled my money four days in a row.}
<A>__{gennady barely glances at the papers eddie pushes in front of him and snorts, half amused, before pushing them back.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{you're lucky.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it's not luck.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{okay, you tricked their computer, you got some fix on the game.}

<D>__{you think?}
<A>__{gennady smiles.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{so you're a crook.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and that's a problem for you because ?}
<A>__{gennady laughs for a second. eddie's not wrong about that. gennady looks in eddie's eyes for a moment, calculating.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{you people all get caught.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i won't. and what if i do? you think i keep detailed records of my investors? you'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened.}
<A>__{gennady just looks at eddie, thinking it over.}
