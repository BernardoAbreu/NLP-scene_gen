<A>__{a cat, hissing, screeching. cut to silus and jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing away from them in fright. jones moves forward and we tilt down to see lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke wisping from the barrel. jones stoops down and picks up the gun, then turns to silus. after a beat, jones throws the gun at silus' head. silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the cobblestones.}
