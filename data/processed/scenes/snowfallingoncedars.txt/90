<L>__{exterior fletcher's bay morning}
<A>__{ishmael at 24, crouched among trees. above a sunlit stretch of beach.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i left the grocery, and wrote a letter. i apologizes from my heart. i should never have said that word to her. i never would again.}
<A>__{close on his face. eyes gazing down. at something.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{it sat in my desk for two weeks. before i threw it away.}
<A>__{he sighs. rises slowly.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i knew her car. and sometimes when i'd see it, i'd...drive that way. at a distance.}
<A>__{see hatsue down on the beach. alone, raking for steamer clams. her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella. ishmael walks down to the sand. crosses to where she works. and squats down. at a respectful distance.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{can i talk to you?}
<A>__{she must have seen who was coming. because the words do not startle her. or slow her work.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i'm married, ishmael. it isn't right for us to be alone. people will t...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{there's no one here, and i've got to talk to you.}
<A>__{her back is to him. she is motionless.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{don't you owe me that?}
<A>__{and she turns. her eyes go first to her sleeping child. then she walks over, and sinks to the sand. just before him. near enough to touch. she looks in his eyes. and waits.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm like a dying person.}
<A>__{the words just came out. his eyes move over her face. his aching for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i don't sleep. i tell myself this can't go on, but it goes on anyway.}
<A>__{he seems at the edge of insanity. or tears.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i did a terrible thing, ishmael. i knew what you felt. and what i didn't.}
<A>__{sadness in her voice. but strength as well.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{and i never found the courage to tell you.}
<A>__{his eyes swim with tears. he chokes them back, he has to.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you'll think this is crazy, but all i want is to hold you. just once. and smell your hair.}
<A>__{she absorbs this. no sign of repulsion or anger. her eyes seem wise. and very sad.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you have to hear this, i can never touch you, ishmael. not once, not ever. there's no half way. as much as i know it hurts you, you have to let this go.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{look, i want to forget you, i do. i think if you hold me, just this once, i can walk away and never speak to you again.}
<A>__{she just keeps looking at him. there is a bravery to her steady gaze. her calm resolve.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{please? as one human being to another, just because i'm miserable and don't know where to turn. i need to be in your arms. if it's just for thirty seconds.}
<A>__{his pleading look holds her for a moment. in the silence...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i hurt for you. whether you'll ever believe that or not.}
<A>__{feeling behind her eyes. first time she lets it show.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i feel sick sometimes, with the guilt of what i've done to you. and i can't make it right.}
<A>__{she rises slowly. brushes the sand from her skirt.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{to hold you would be wrong and deceitful. you're going to have to live without holding me, that is the truth of the way things are.}
<A>__{she takes one step back.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{things end. they do. get on with your life.}
<A>__{and turns away. she gathers her baby in her arms. takes her blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail. he watches, never moving, as she gathers her things. gathers them as if he wasn't there. and with her back turned...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{get on with your life.}
<A>__{she walks slowly away. her baby cries.}
