<A>__{gus is entering the scene.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{your milk, sir.}
<A>__{he serves bruce.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{and i brought you another cup of coffee, hildy.}
<A>__{gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of burns' chair.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{thanks, gus.}
<A>__{she takes a sip and almost chokes.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{too hot?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(gasping for breath)}
<D>__{no. it's strong.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{but i like it that way.}
<A>__{gus goes, smiling.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{say, what's happened to burns? he looks sunk, doesn't he?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{he certainly hic does!}
<A>__{burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{anything the matter?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{just sweeney again. one of my best reporters.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. they can't even find him.}
<P>__{(he sips his coffee)}
<D>__{i tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(sipping hers)}
<D>__{you said it.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{so sweeney gets twins and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{just what is the lowdown on williams?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{it's simple. a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{if he's nuts, why doesn't the state just put him away?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{because it happened to be a colored policeman.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(for bruce's benefit)}
<D>__{the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{especially with an election coming up in a few days.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{are you sure williams is not all there?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{all you've got to do is talk to him. but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re elected.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{but couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?}
<A>__{closeup burns}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(there's a sly}
<D>__{expression on his}
<P>__{face)}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{hildy's voice}
<D>__{you could run an interview that would prove it. remember the interview i wrote with jimmy wellman? that saved his life.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(slapping hands together)}
<D>__{yes, you could do it, hildy. you could save that poor devil's life. you could but }
<P>__{(the enthusiasm dies away)}
<D>__{ you're going away. i forgot.}
<B>__{three shot}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{how long would the interview take?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{oh an hour for the interview. another hour to write it.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{we could take the six o'clock train, hildy. if it would save a man's life.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{no, bruce, dear. don't you see? this is a trick to get your sympathy. no, walter, i've been waiting for something like this but i wasn't sure when you'd spring it. if you want to save earl williams' life, you can interview him yourself. you're still a good reporter. bruce and i will be on that four o'clock train and thanks just the same.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i'm an editor. i know what ought to be written, but i can't write it the way you could. it needs a woman's heart }
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{why, walter, you're getting poetic!}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(to bruce)}
<D>__{you see what i had to put up with? she never trusted me! you argue with her otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!}
<A>__{bruce gulps.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{how can you have any happiness after that? all through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! i tell you, earl williams' face will come between you on the train tonight and at the preacher's tomorrow and all the rest of your lives!}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(breaking into applause)}
<D>__{what a performance! bravo! don't let him fool you, bruce it's only an act!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what do you mean, only an act? haven't you got any feeling?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney's.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago. if he's got twins this morning, i claim it was done with mirrors.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(laughs, throws up his hands)}
<D>__{all right, hildy, i'm licked. but i will make you and bruce a business proposition.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{we're not interested.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(to bruce)}
<D>__{maybe you'll be. you're a smart young man. you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. what do you say?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i don't use my wife for business purposes, mr. burns!}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{wait a minute, bruce. what's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{and what's the matter with a thousand dollars?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{according to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. listen, bruce, i don't want walter burns to use me, but i'm perfectly willing to use him. how long will it take to get him examined?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{now you're talking!}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(turning on burns)}
<D>__{you keep out of this. bruce, suppose you examine mr. burns in his office. i will get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building. you phone me as soon as mr. burns has given you his check. then i will go get the interview and you phone mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.}
<P>__{(back to burns)}
<D>__{and no tricks, walter!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what tricks would i pull?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{oh, nothing! of course, you might cancel the check. yes! wait a minute! what would be his first payment on that policy?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{about twenty five hundred dollars.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{better make that a certified check, walter.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{what do you think i am a crook?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{yes and that's putting it mildly! no certified check no story get me?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{all right. the check will be certified. want my fingerprints?}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{no thanks, i've still got those. well, i will step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn. it'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. remember, bruce, it must be certified.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{all right, dear.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{wait a minute, bruce. have you got that money?}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(feeling his pocket)}
<D>__{the five hundred? sure.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{on second thought, would you let me have it? i will get the tickets.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{believe me, bruce, i know what i'm doing. he'd get you in a crap game }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{but i don't gamble, hilda!}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met walter burns. please, dear.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(he pulls out his wallet)}
<D>__{one two three four five. five hundred. be careful, honey.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i will be careful, darling. you be, please.}
<A>__{she kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to burns' cheek.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{so long, husbands.}
<A>__{she goes. trucking shot hildy leaving. she weaves just a bit. med. close shot the two men they look after her.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(smiling a little)}
<D>__{i never knew hildy to be so determined before.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{you haven't seen anything yet.}
<A>__{bruce turns to look at burns they look at each other.}
