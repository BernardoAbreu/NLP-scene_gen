<L>__{exterior house pre dawn}
<A>__{a stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. stephen holds the door of a car open, while bloom steps from the flaming house.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{"four months and a thousand years ago." that's kipling, isn't it? he stole that from kipling.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{no.}
<L>__{exterior berlin pre dawn}
<A>__{hazy light over the sprawling city.}
<L>__{interior deutch mark}
<A>__{a low, cozy basement level bar. a dozen people crowd it, all expectant in a surprise party type way. a turkish gentleman in a white linen suit and eye patch raises his drink when bloom, stephen and the woman enter.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{make way, make room for the brothers bloom!}
<A>__{the bar bursts into cheers.}
<L>__{interior deutch mark later}
<A>__{a dwarf dances on the bar. stephen plays cards with the turk, an albino and a small crowd of character types.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{nine months, six countries, three faked deaths, for one mark. you're a beautiful antique, my friend.}
<A>__{they clink glasses.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{proust.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{one thing baffles me. the entire con would have fallen apart if charleston had walked away. how did you know he'd pull the trigger?}
<A>__{stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{just think of any card. got one?}
<A>__{stephen cuts the deck randomly 2 of spades.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{stephen shrugs.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{but if i do it enough, eventually it'll work on someone. and then it'll be the best card trick in the world.}
<A>__{wink. the dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. stephen kicks a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{ante up.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{it's true you never work with the same crew twice?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{well shit. except for the uh, for her?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{la chinoise?}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{back at the bar the asian woman. the chink. being hit on by a weasly romanian.}
<C>__{romanian}
<D>__{yeah, i'm pretty big into anime.}
<A>__{she almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{our fifth beatle. she knows the ins and the outs, and so far as i can tell, speaks three words of english.}
<A>__{she taps on the bar.}
<C>__{the chink}
<D>__{jameson.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{ice?}
<A>__{she says `no' with a look.}
<C>__{the albino}
<D>__{so she's with you and bloom till the end.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{just till the wind changes.}
<A>__{stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the chink. she flicks a champaign flute to make a `ding!' and mimes the bullet bouncing off her.}
<C>__{the turk}
<D>__{where is bloom?}
<A>__{in the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains, bloom sits alone playing solitaire. stuck with a queen of hearts he can't play. a beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{there you are. hiding?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i've been learning. stephen likes to talk about you.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{did he tell you the cave story?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{is it true?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{what else did he tell you?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm not going to tell it as good as stephen. you two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in st. petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the diamond dog. and he was your fagin and stephen was his artful dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why did he do that?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{and then the brothers bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. sounds romantic.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it does.}
<A>__{she pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table, her face inches from bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a kiss. bloom's eyes stay open.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you want to know how stephen did it? with charleston?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's not the first thing on my mind.}
