<A>__{as she continues }
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{and you better try to find something to put the fuel in and get it the hell away from there, as we don't want it to go up when the rocket goes off.}
<A>__{gallagher considers. yeah, it all makes sense. but how?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior cosmos site minutes later}
<A>__{gallagher, using the few tools he has left, has unbolted the sample return container. measures its width }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i need you to do some math. a cylinder 50 centimeters wide, how deep is six liters?}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{eleven and three quarters centimeters.}
<A>__{he measures and scribes in the line.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{somewhere, mr. plummer, my 10th grade math teacher, is cackling like a son of a bitch.}
<A>__{under which, he slithers underneath, opens the main purge and fills the big steel bucket with rocket fuel. it looks just like the guy at texaco, working on your car. lugs it away from the cosmos.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{launch diagnostics. avoid pressing anything that says ignition.}
<A>__{he runs it seals are good, pumps are good, engine's ready. and the ignition power force, all 300 volts of it, is dead as a doornail. the program suggests the replacement part number. and suggests he order it quickly. checks again. answer's the same. he slumps down, sits beside srm. he ain't going nowhere. just sits there. can't move. can't speak. after all this, he's fucked. stares out into the distance. finally }
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{gallagher?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no. no go. there's enough power to run the computer, but not enough to launch.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{how much do you need?}
<C>__{gallaher}
<D>__{i need 300 volts at six amps. and i've 28 volts running the computer system. ignition battery's stone cold.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{is there anything you can use?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{let me look around and see if i see a high voltage source....no, just rocks. in fact, everywhere i look, there's just fucking rocks. and more fucking rocks.}
<A>__{then, as he tries not to break down }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i'm gonna die here.}
