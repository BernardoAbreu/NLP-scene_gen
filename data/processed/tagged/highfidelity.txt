<B>__{records}
<A>__{big thin lps. fields of them. we move across them, slowly... they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but then the cd's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes...}
<C>__{rob }
<D>__{but nobody worries about kids listening to thousands literally thousands of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.}
<A>__{it seems the records, tapes, and cd's will never end until... we come to rob always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you. he sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him.}

<D>__{did i listen to pop music because i was miserable, or was i miserable because i listened to pop music?}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{group of bags huddled next to the door. not the go on vacation set, but the clothes to coffee maker moving out variety. rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair boudokan headphones. we hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time. laura, rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off. she clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence. she begins to heft the bags, rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye. laura begins to cry a bit.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't really know what i'm doing.}
<A>__{he smiles, and she doesn't. he adjusts.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you don't have to go this second. you can stay until whenever.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{we've done the hard part now. i might as well, you know...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well stay for tonight, then.}
<A>__{laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door. a strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind rob. he stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of laura and her dragging bags.}

<C>__{rob}
<D>__{those were the ones that really hurt. can you see your name in that list, laura? maybe you'd sneak into the top ten, but there's no place for you in the top five. sorry. those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that you're just not capable of delivering.}
<A>__{he adjusts the angle of the tv, stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable. unhappiness used to mean something. now it's just a drag like a cold or having no money.}
<A>__{he moves through the living room to an open window facing the street. looking down two stories, he sees laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street.}

<D>__{it would be nice to think that since i was fourteen, times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, but there still seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since. all my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one.}

<C>__{rob }
<D>__{penny was nice, but i wasn't interested in nice, just breasts, and therefore she was no good to me. and so i was finished with her.}
<A>__{she leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.}

<A>__{rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten down door.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here on saturday young men, always young men, who spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted smiths singles and "original not rereleased" underline frank zappa albums.}
<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{in almost darkness. more light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record release posters taped to them. a dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug. on the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of jah wobble and glen glenn and other people you've never heard of. but as rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.}

<C>__{barry}
<D>__{baa! ba ba dang!}
<A>__{dick shrinks back from him instinctively. he stops mid step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store. his face adopts an exaggerated grimace.}

<D>__{it's the new }

<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{great. that's the fun of working in a record store. playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. i thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{we'll do it next monday.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{well what's the point in that?}
<A>__{from outside. hear the sound of skateboard wheels clacking and scraping, getting louder. rob, dick and barry stop fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store. dick to the register, barry to the back, rob next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight. the sound gets closer, then stops. the door swings open to admit vince and justin, two fifteen year old skate punks. vince's hair is post apocolyptically hacked to different lengths, justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse. rob follows them, watching their every move. dick counters from his perch, getting another angle. barry cracks his knuckles threateningly. vince and justin do their best browser impersonations. finally justin plucks a cd, and the two move to the counter.}

<D>__{no. we need the gig.}
<C>__{rob}

<D>__{we're not as bad as you think, rob.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you couldn't be. look, barry. there's going to be people from laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums. how are you going to cope with them?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{we're not called barrytown anymore, by the by. they got sick of the barry barrytown thing. we're called sdm. sonic death monkey.}

<D>__{it's no joke. i'm responsible for what happens, you know. embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. i have to put down a deposit for the room. i have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them }

<D>__{right. why?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, i used to go to the dodger on your nights, and i saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then and now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh. okay.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i thought i would ask you a few questions if that's okay.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{huh. you used to come to the club? i shouldn't have let you in. you must have only been about sixteen.}
<A>__{rob realizes what he must be sounding like. he blushes and retreats.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what i mean is, i didn't mean you look young. you don't. you don't look old either. you look just as old as you are. a bit younger maybe, but not a lot. not much. just right.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{so. is now a good time?}
<A>__{rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in the store. he nods. she pulls out a pad and pencil.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{right. so. you must have an enormous record collection.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah. i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.}

<D>__{your desert island top five.}

<D>__{oh boy... in the club, or at home?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{is there a difference?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(a little too shrill)}
<D>__{of course... well yeah, a bit. "sin city" by the flying burrito brothers is an all time top five, but i wouldn't play it at the club. it's a country rock ballad. everybody'd go home.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{nevermind. any five. so four more.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what do you mean, four more?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well if one of them is this "sin city" thing }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{can i go home and work this out and let you know? in a week or so?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. i will do one. my five favorite from the old days at the dodger.}

"shipbuilding," elvis costello, japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "mystery train" by elvis presley... and... "spaced cowboy" by sly and the family stone. a bit controversial, i know, but...}

<C>__{rob}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{that's five. so. why did you decide to deejay again?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. so...}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{okay. "dance music for old people?"}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{and the new label? and the kinky wizards?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, well, the kinky wizards are you know what? why don't i just make you a tape?}
