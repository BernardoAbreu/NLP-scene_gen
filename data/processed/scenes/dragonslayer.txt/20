<B>__{dungeon}
<A>__{two guards thrust galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred door shut. the young sorcerer waits until they're safely out of sight, then takes out his amulet. he ponders it for a doubtful moment. suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips it off his neck and out through the bars.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he makes an ironic salute and leaves. galen sits down heavily and stares at the stone walls.}
<B>__{corridor}
