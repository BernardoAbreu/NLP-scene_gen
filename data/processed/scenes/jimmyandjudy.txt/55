<L>__{exterior rest stop secluded area trunk of the car night}
<A>__{a weird, digital, black and white image plays on the camera. there's no light and jimmy's got the camera back in "nite shot" mode. he's standing outside of the car filming the homeless man who is lying dead inside of the trunk. judy stands next to him as he films. the homeless man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in the small confines of the trunk. jimmy pans back and forth and up and down his dead body.}

<D>__{you promise?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yeah. come here.}
<A>__{jimmy has dropped the camera away from the homeless man. he's still rolling while he wraps his arms around her and holds her. we hear him kissing her softly.}
