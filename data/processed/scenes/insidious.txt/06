<L>__{interior living room, lambert home night}
<A>__{high ceilings. exposed beams. spanish style windows. renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living room. no matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with each step. a grandfather clock in the corner ticks steadily. there is barely any furniture in here, only a bookcase and a piano. what there is a lot of...is boxes. large moving boxes. renai plops cross legged onto the floor and rips open one of the boxes, marked books. she plucks out a handful of books and lines them up on the bookshelf. then another handful. they are all self help and self improvement books. titles like `be the better you' and `inch by inch, it's a cinch: a guide to achieving your goals' pop out. she spots a sealed box labelled photo albums. she strips away the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos. smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. the happy couple. young. glowing. sadness washes over her.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{mom?}
<A>__{she snaps out of it and turns to see dalton lambert (8). her son. he approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (it is not the boy we saw in the opening scene.)}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{what are you doing up, kiddo?}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{i don't like my room.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you'll get used to it. it's only your first night.}
<A>__{he climbs into her lap. she bites on his ear playfully.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{argh, i'm going to eat you.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{just some photos.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{what photos?}
<A>__{she hefts another album from the box, prying it open. a photo of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{do you know who that is?}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{it doesn't look like you.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i know. i'm so happy there. but it's me. when i was your age. i was a kid once too, you know.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{no, you weren't.}
<A>__{renai bursts out laughing. she is famous for her big laugh.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{thanks. maybe you're right...i don't remember being this person at all. i hope she smiled like that all the time, whoever she was.}
<A>__{she sizes up her son. the living embodiment of the photo.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{this is a terrible thing to admit, dalton, but sometimes i get jealous of you. that you're so young. that you haven't made any of your decisions yet.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{i don't wanna grow old.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{well, it starts happening to us from the moment we're born.}
<A>__{she points to the hands on the grandfather clock.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{every time that clock ticks, we all get a little bit older.}
<A>__{she turns the page in the photo album, seeing an old man.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{that's your grandpa. you wouldn't remember him.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{he smells like smoke.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{yeah...good memory. he did smoke that god awful pipe, didn't he?}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{show me a picture of dad when he was a little kid.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't even know if we have any. he's hopeless with keeping photos.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{show me a picture of me when i was a little kid.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{your pictures are all in the computer. nobody keeps photo albums like this anymore, they're ancient relics. they should. i like being able to touch something, instead of it floating around in cyber world. if the laptop breaks, your whole existence is erased.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{what was i like when i was a little kid?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you are a little kid.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{if only you knew what i know.}
<A>__{we hear a baby crying off screen.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{you certainly didn't cry as much as your little sister does. come on.}
