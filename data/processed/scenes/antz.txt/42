<D>__{man, your girl is fly, know what i'm saying?}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(overdoing it)}
<D>__{oh, bala? i guess she's okay, you know, for a princess. i mean, i usually date queens, or you know, empresses, because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality. please stop me if i'm making you feel inadequate.}
<A>__{they throw down the m&m, which lands with a thud. z notices that the rest of the insects look spooked.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{what's the matter? this place is as cheery as a roach motel at check out time.}

<D>__{i'm going back. i've got to get her. who'll come with me?}
<A>__{z looks around. nobody's volunteering. nothing but sheepish looks and shuffling from the insects of insectopia. z looks disheartened. he's about to leave when }

<C>__{male wasp}
<D>__{i know what it's like to lose someone...i keep hearing the sound of muffy's flapping wings...so i will take you.}
<A>__{z hops on the wasp's back.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{let's go, pal!}
