<A>__{renai's eyes flutter open. she glances over. no one is there.}
<L>__{interior kitchen, new house early morning}
<A>__{renai shuffles into the kitchen. josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at dalton's drawing. he hasn't slept and looks it. he looks up at her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{renai approaches josh and they hug...holding on for dear life.}
<L>__{exterior new house night}
<A>__{the lambert house is lit from within. like a jack o lantern.}
<L>__{interior dalton's room night}
<A>__{action stations. tucker sets up two stills camera's around dalton's room, zipping back and forth between the two tripods. specs opens up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil. a small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to dalton's bed. elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by josh and renai.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{what's most important is that you realize no two attempts are the same. i will be completely honest with you about the results, and if no dialogue is established, i will tell you. i am not in the business of embellishing success. what happens, happens.}
<A>__{josh and renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{forget the limits and laws and logic of this world. we are treading in a different place now.}
<A>__{tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner, holding up a hand held video camera.}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{these still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere, electrical or temperature wise. don't be alarmed if they go off.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{everything i say while i am in tune will be at a very low volume, so you won't hear any of it. steven will write it down and repeat it for you.}
<A>__{specs waits obediently at her side.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{hold on to each other, and stay focused. you'll see things you don't understand. confusing things. do not question them or speak in any way.}
<A>__{she turns to specs.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{dim the lights please.}
<A>__{tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level. elise closes her eyes, concentrating. she relaxes her head, as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders. one of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room in white light for a split second. elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. soon, she is very still. specs nods to tucker silently, then produces an odd looking device made from grey cloth. it almost resembles a gas mask from world war 1, with a cone shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. the snout of the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early version of a microphone. specs slips two hooks over elise's ears and gently places the device over her nose and mouth. he then takes a seat next to her, behind renai, who holds elise's hand. specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus around his neck that holds a flashlight in place. he flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of elise's facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand. dead silence descends over the group like a blanket. then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. it is elise's muttered whispers. specs begins writing. renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in cursive. we are calling out to you dalton renai grips josh's hand tightly.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{we are calling out to you dalton. tell us that you are safe tell us where you are}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{tell us that you are safe. tell us where you are.}
<A>__{for what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still... ...until elise's eyelids flutter. another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone at specs' ear. he writes.}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{who's there? it is your mother and father we have been}
<A>__{looking for you}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{it is your mother and father. we have been looking for you.}
<A>__{long pause. specs writes again, more intense this time. i need help i can't see in here}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{i need help...i can't see in here. follow my voice dalton come back to us}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{follow my voice dalton. come back to us.}
<A>__{another long pause. a little too long. why aren't you talking anymore dalton?}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{why aren't you talking anymore dalton?}
<A>__{a long beat. tucker's camera flash goes off again. if they hear me they'll hurt me}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{if they hear me, they'll hurt me. who will hurt you?}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{who will hurt you?}
<A>__{the man with fire on his face}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{the man with fire on his face. can you find your way back to us?}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{can you find your way back to us?}
<A>__{there is no way out}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{there is no way out. follow my voice dalton}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{follow my voice dalton. be quiet they'll hear you}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{be quiet, they'll hear you.}
<A>__{they won't hear you just follow my voice}
<C>__{specs }
<D>__{they won't hear you, just follow my voice. they are coming they heard you help me}
<A>__{helpme mom and dad please save me please come and get mepleasecomeandgetmecome elise's head twitches as specs' writes furiously, trying to keep up. his pencil finally snaps. he snatches up another.}
<D>__{dalton are you there? dalton?}
<A>__{an agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl: listen to me you filthy whore he isnt here you should not have come here you fucking bitch i will rip your cunt apart and eat the fucking innards that spill forth from it i}
<B>__{haveseenyouiknowwhoyouarebutyouandthe}
<A>__{specs writing begins to shred the paper as he writes furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. sweat flies from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down. suddenly a piercing scream blasts through the microphone and he jerks it away from his ear then looks over at elise. with utter dread, he sees that she is no longer wearing the mask. she has taken it off and is panting heavily. the scream continues through the mic, audible to everyone...then peters out. shocked silence follows. josh glances over at dalton's bed. he is not in it. stunned, josh turns back to the table to see dalton sitting next to him. staring at him. his heart leaps out of his skin and so does renai's as they both turn towards dalton. their son. dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face. then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands, wrenching it downwards with almighty force and breaking his}
<B>__{own jaw.}
<A>__{renai screams into the abyss as dalton bellows at them, spit flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his dislocated jaw. he stamps his foot and the table and everyone sitting at it, renai, josh and elise go flying backwards as if pushed by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power. we realize that dalton was not sitting at the table, but squatting down awkwardly. painfully. he stands up, then steps forward. as josh and renai watch, his knee begins to bend backwards, the tendons stretching and snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction. his other knee follows and he steps forward both knees bending back. specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad still in hand. when he looks up at dalton, the flashlight under his chin shines in dalton's eyes. dalton roars and advances forward slapping specs with the force of ten men. specs reels backwards, hitting the wall, smashing his head and crumpling like paper. elise stands to face dalton. the camera flash goes off again, lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing elise the lipstick smeared face of a demon instead of dalton's face. tucker shrinks back as he captures all this with the video camera. dalton steps forward again and elise charges at him, grabbing dalton by the hair.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{leave this vessel! leave this vessel!}
<A>__{dalton bellows again a howl so course and ungodly that it seems ripped straight from the bowels of lucifer himself.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{leave this vessel!}
<A>__{dalton flies backwards, hitting the corner of the wall and then climbing it, arcing his body into the far corner of the ceiling like an expert contortionist. he hisses at them as the camera flash fires again and again, showing them split second frames of the red faced creature.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{leave this earthly body!}
<A>__{dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks elise down. the room begins to shake. books fly. the closet doors burst open. with terror, elise looks over and sees several figures peering out from within the closet. two are the women that specs' drew. another is a small man, dressed like a child. they stare out at elise, their eyes glinting in the dark. elise turns to see josh. the camera flash strobes repeatedly and gives us split second glimpses of an old woman, dressed in victorian era garb standing directly behind josh. and then, with absolute fear, renai sees the long haired man standing over her. he screams at her and pushes her against the wall, licking her. she cries out, terrified. with the spirit world, crashing in around her, elise pulls herself off the floor and yells again.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{leave his body!}
<A>__{dalton suddenly spasms, dropping out of the corner and hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{the lights!}
<A>__{terrified, specs' scrambles over to the corner, flicking the light switch. the room is instantly flooded with light. the room has stopped shaking. the screaming has stopped.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{dalton!}
<A>__{renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches dalton's limp body.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{dalton! dalton!}
<A>__{she listens for breathing. his chest moves. he is still breathing. she holds him and cries. more desperate than ever.}
