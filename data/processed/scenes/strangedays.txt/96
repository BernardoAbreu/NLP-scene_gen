<T>__{cut to lenny:}
<A>__{, the streetlight washing across his face. he gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread. in pov we see iris go into the bedroom, out of sight. we can hear the television on in there. using a steel jimmy the wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside. we stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements. water running in the bathroom. we come around the door frame. bedroom dark, bathed in tv glow. iris in the bathroom, washing her face with cold water. we move toward her. crossing the room as she reaches for a towel. we are now only a couple of feet away. she comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face. she lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes whip back. widening in terror. she reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed. we go after her. her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic. she whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire. she smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning fast. we follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door. across the living room and down the short hall to the front door. closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall. slam! we tackle her against the far wall of the corridor. our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner. zap! we nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades. she sags to the floor, gasping. we zap her again. the wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor... nobody in sight. we clamp our hand over iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door. on lenny, reacting. going white.}

<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{go to the sunset sheraton. right now! just go! go!}
<A>__{lenny goes back under the wire, seeing... we are dragging a semiconscious iris into the bathroom... propping her up with her back against the white tile wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one to the steel towel rack above her. she is moaning. and crying.}
<C>__{iris}
<P>__{(voice distorted)}
<D>__{i haven't seen your face... i haven't heard your voice... you can still let me go...}
<A>__{zap! the wearer hits her with the stunner again. she jerks and gasps for breath. we see our latex gloved finger come up in front of us and hear ssshhh. moving quickly now. our hands unbuckle the fanny pack. pull out something... a set of playback trodes. our hands place them on her head. she stares uncomprehending. what? we catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{holy shit. he's jacking her in to his own output. she's seeing what he's seeing. she's seeing herself.}
<A>__{iris can now see herself as the wearer sees her... wide eyed with terror, white lipped, weeping. helpless. and she can feel what he feels. the wearer's hand goes back into the fanny pack and pulls out something else. a black athletic headband. we slip it over her head, down over her eyes. a blindfold. now she can only see what the wearer sees. and also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. with our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull. it extends with an ominous clicking sound. we lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her t shirt, laying it open. exposing her torso. we then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off. we put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. mace looks at lenny's expression of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half block from the sunset sheraton. lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him. he is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. in pov we see the wearer pull his jogging pants down below his knees (r rated please) and reach for iris. kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her. iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... she feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration. on lenny, sweating and barely able to breath. mace stops the tape... concerned by lenny's reaction. he opens his eyes... mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal. but he shakes his head. he has to know. he pushes her hand away and punches play. it floods into his head again. the sweaty, grunting horror. the stalker picks up her slit t shirt and quickly wraps it around her neck. he knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot. the muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter. the stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the t shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw. via her trodes, iris watches herself die. her death comes at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her... blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain, death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant. on lenny, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(like a mantra)}
<D>__{on my god. oh my god.}
<A>__{back to pov, a glimpse of the wearer's hand relaxing the knot. iris' head lolls. her mouth is slack and open. we remove her blindfold. her eyes are half lidded. very dead looking. our fingers gently push them wide open. back to lenny, looking like he has been gut kicked. he gasps for breath. to pov, as the killer's hand calmly moves iris' head from side to side... studying her dead face. her staring eyes. he leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye, the pupil wide, seeing nothing. a burst of static. end of tape. lenny opens his eyes. he fumbles open the car door and practically rolls out onto the sidewalk. the trodes pull off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk to a darkened storefront where he leans for support. he doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach. mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to his knees. she holds his shoulders while he throws up again.}

<D>__{my god, lenny. what is it?}

<D>__{blackjack? i don't understand }
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{snuff clip. it was iris. she said she needed my help and i... aw jesus, mace... the sick fucker killed her.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{are you sure it's real?}
<A>__{lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel. mace follows his glance. they notice for the first time: cop lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon. close on iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the coroner's van.}
