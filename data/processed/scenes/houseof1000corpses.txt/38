<D>__{keep straight on this road here.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{how much further?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm not exactly sure... it looks close. did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{mary and denise sit bundled up in blankets.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{let's just skip it. it is probably nothing anyway.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{aw christ, jerry. we can't see anything now, it's too dark. let's forget it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{come on, we need something like this. it could be the real deal. it's too far out of the way to come back to.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{through the windshield we see a lone figure hitch hiking by the side of the road. it is a girl, baby, 27, in a worn cowboy hat and long fur coat. she is soaked to the bone.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it's a hitchhiker.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{should we stop?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she looks like a freak.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. she's soaked.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she looks like she stinks.}
