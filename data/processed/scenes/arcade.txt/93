<L>__{exterior level seven, pier day}
<A>__{the sound of shattering glass carried through as alex explodes out of the sky. and it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering... title reads "level seven sea of darkness"}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{continues her fall. she lands hard. no blue desert sand to cushion her here. it takes her a moment to rise... alex is on a slat board pier extending out into a sea of black water. the shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier. storms clouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the open sea, you know what it looks like... ...the and of the world. a strange and scary yellow green sky presses down on us. it's a hurricane sky. the calm before the storm. on the horizon, two cities can be seen. techno cityscapes, angular and metallic looking, towers jutting up from the sea like knives.}
<B>__{at the end of the piers}
<A>__{are two boats. standing in them are two pale faced, cloaked figures. like charon, the boatman on the river styx. somewhere off in the distance, the ringing can be distinctly heard now. but alex is preoccupied now. as she moves down the pier, recognition dawns on her. it's laurie and stilts. they are dressed completely in black, hair slicked back and eyes empty. white faced gothic harlequins. each is holding a wooden staff, staring into space.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{guys! oh my god...}
<A>__{alex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement fades. a chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a metronome, lulling the world into stillness.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{laurie? stilts?}
<A>__{neither of them acknowledges alex with their eyes.}
<C>__{stilts}
<P>__{(like arcade)}
<D>__{you may ask one of us a question. one tells the truth, and the other lies. who you ask, remains your discretion. but if the answer is wrong, the questioner dies.}
<A>__{laurie motions to the techno cities behind her.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(like arcade)}
<D>__{one of these cities, is the place you seek. the teller of truths will take you there. but the city of lies, is dark and bleak. and death is certain if you enter, beware.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{i am the liar. where should i take you?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i am the truth teller. where should i take you?}
<A>__{alex stares at them a moment, utterly confused. the sky above darkens, and the wind picks up. she looks to the horizon, from one city to another, then back at her friends.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{what did he do to you?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{is that your question?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{wait! no! that's not it!}
<A>__{beep! beep! beep! alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display anymore. she begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at the horizon. and yes, there's the flash followed by the shriek sonic}
<B>__{boom.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{think! i want to go to the city of truth, and the truth teller is from there...but which one is which? the liar...think!}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you have no time. what is your question?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(snapping back)}
<D>__{i'm thinking!}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you have no time.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{is visible now, arms opening to engulf alex. talk about pressure.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(she stops pacing)}
<D>__{the liar...truth teller...liar...liar...}
<A>__{alex rushes over to stilts.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{liar. did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?}
<C>__{stilts}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{i came from the city on the left.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{but you always lie, so you didn't come from there. that means the city on the left must be the city of truth.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{has reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the entire structure... alex turns to laurie.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{take me to the city on the left!}
<A>__{laurie nods and steps aside, making room for alex to climb into the boat. she does and...}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{dissipates just before it reaches alex. it turns into mist and vanishes, the howl lingering as an echo long after the screamer itself has gone. at once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier. alex gets a last glimpse of stilts standing in his boat, diminishing as alex and laurie move away from him. he looks like the loneliest person in the world.
