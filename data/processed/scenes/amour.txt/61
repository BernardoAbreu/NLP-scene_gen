<L>__{interior adjoining room kitchen night}
<A>__{from the adjoining room, we see georges seated at the kitchen table, writing. finally we see what he is writing: ... you won't believe it. a pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well. this time i caught it. in fact it wasn't difficult at all. but i set it free again. i'm going to ...}
<L>__{interior adjoining room kitchen hallway day}
<A>__{georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling. o.s., we faintly hear the sound of running water, and from time to time the clattering of dishes. after a while, georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. he remains in the doorway and watches anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm almost done.}
<A>__{georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.}
<C>__{anne's voice}
<D>__{you can put your shoes on if you want.}
<A>__{georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes. o.s. we hear anne finishing her work. she comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom. meanwhile, georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. when she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they head for the front door.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{aren't you taking a coat?}
<A>__{georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench coat from the hook and they leave the apartment.}
