<L>__{interior jam's study hall day}
<A>__{jam slowly sinks in his chair under the profoundly humiliating weight of an entire school's echoed laughter.}
<L>__{interior waiting area day}
<A>__{mrs. bruce sits next to a stand up ashtray in the high school's waiting area. scowling, she fans the kiss tickets out with one hand. jam sits across from her, one leg jittering anxiously. they sit for an uncomfortably long time until... mrs. bruce pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st. bernard's. we're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{you mean, you're sending me to... b b boarding school?}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{what else can i do? oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? tickets? jeremiah, do you realize what this means? that you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! now you want to see the devil in the flesh. you want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in detroit no less!}
<A>__{she flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{mom, three of those tickets don't even belong to me. they're for the guys.}
<A>__{mrs. bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{and if the "guys" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things.}
<A>__{mrs. bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel eternity. jam stares semi catatonic through his mom's sour expression.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{it's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve.}
<A>__{she stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm.}
<B>__{reverse angle on nearby corner}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex peek around it, their heads forming a totem pole. one by one they pull back.}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{they slump against the wall devastated.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i knew it! i knew this was gonna happen! i had a bad feeling since last night. remember? we are so totally fucked!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{waitaminit, dudes! i got it! maybe we can glue the tickets back together!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{what are you, high?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{for once lex is right. it's over. things can't get any worse from here.}
<A>__{suddenly, a caustic voice blurts from down the hall.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i hope you rodents have hall passes!}
<A>__{the boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied, yellow toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips. meet elvis.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{wanna bet.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{could that be three detentions i smell?}
<A>__{elvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them like a maniac. keys jangling furiously.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{second floor girls' john! two minutes! he'll never look there!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{check!}
<A>__{they take off in three different directions. still laughing, elvis stops where the boys just were. which one to follow? he bolts after hawk who has taken the nearest staircase.}
