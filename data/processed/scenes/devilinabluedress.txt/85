<D>__{joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him...}
<A>__{she swipes at joppy and he backhands her against the stove... she struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down.}

<A>__{daphne breaks for the back way and easy tries to bar shariff from going after her.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{manny swings the baseball bat into easy's side. and easy yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall. albright grabs easy from behind and pries him free enough for manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of the bat. easy sinks to his knees seeing double. shariff leads daphne back into the room, her face contorted into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock.}

<A>__{he shoves manny through the door and pushes easy onto his side with his foot and he's out the door. easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and the sound of a car engine growls to life. he thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the count. he gets it open in time to see...}
