<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. with great effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the floor next to him. he stares into the toilet. for a moment all is calm. the gentle "ping ping ping" of a computer somewhere inside the base. sam breathing steadily. spots of sweat on his upper lip. and then he vomits. he vomits loud, he vomits violently. his whole body thrusts forward in the process, taught, tense, like a dog being yanked on a chain. sam 1 vomits again. and again. and again. and stops. angle from above sam 1 sam 1's vomit is dark red he's thrown up blood but that's not all we can clearly see two or three teeth floating in the vomit }

<A>__{sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth he uses his thumbs, shows his gums revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of teeth. he flushes the toilet.}
