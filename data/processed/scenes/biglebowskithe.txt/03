<B>__{bowling pins}
<A>__{scattered by a strike. music and head credits play over various bowling shots pins flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc. the music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike. a lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hot damn, i'm throwin' rocks tonight. mark it, dude.}
<A>__{we are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of bud. he has dark worried eyes and a goatee. hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts. he also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. this is walter. he squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he addresses the dude at the scoring table. the dude, also holding a large plastic cup of bud, wears some of its foam on his mustache.}

<B>__{close on a plaque}
<A>__{we pull back from the name jeffrey lebowski engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from variety clubs international, honors lebowski as achiever of the year. reflected in the plaque we see the dude entering the room with a young man. we hear the two men talk:}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{and this is the study. you can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.}

<A>__{our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed life magazine cover which is headlined are you a lebowski achiever? oddly, the dude's sunglassed face is on it; we realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the display is mirrored. we hear the door open and the whine of a motor. the dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look. so does brandt, the young man we've been listening to. he wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin. entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair jeff lebowski.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{okay sir, you're a lebowski, i'm a lebowski, that's terrific, i'm very busy so what can i do for you?}

<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{my wife is not the issue here. i hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame. i didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in korea took them from me but i went out and achieved anyway. i can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{it's the lebaron.}
<A>__{dude's point of view tracking toward the pool. a young woman sits facing it, her back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails. beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool.}
