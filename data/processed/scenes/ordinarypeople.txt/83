<D>__{you're the doctor.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{don't take refuge in one liners like "you're the doctor". okay? because that pisses me off.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{so everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{yeah, but i don't blame her. i mean, she's got... she's got her reasons. it's impossible after all the shit i've pulled!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what shit have you pulled? hey! remember! i'm talking proportion here. now, what shit?}
<A>__{conrad sighs.}
<C>__{dr berger }
<D>__{come on. you must be able to come up with at least one example. and don't give me "i tried to kill myself", that's old turkey. what have you done lately?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{lately?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{uh, uh.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{hey, come on, if you... listen, i'm never gonna be forgiven for that. never! you know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. everything had to be pitched. even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right. if you think i'm gonna forgive... that she's gonna forgive me...}
<A>__{conrad stops. dr. berger looks at conrad to signal him he just said something: conrad realizes he just made a freudian slip, looks at him,}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{conrad stands up, reflects, looks outside window.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i think i just figured something out.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{who it is who can't forgive who...}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i've heard this all before.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{doesn't make it any less true.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i'm so tired.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{so what do i do now?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{recognize her limitations.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{you mean, like she can't love me?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{oh, kiddo, no. like she can't love you enough. like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{but she loves my father. i know she loved my brother. it's me!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{ha! now we're back to the rotten kid routine! she can't love you because you're unlovable. where does that leave your dad? how come he loves you? you're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{that's different. he feels responsible. besides, he loves everybody.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{ho, i get it! the guy's got no taste! he loves you, but he's wrong. look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{i mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{you mean me?}
<A>__{conrad is wondering.}
<C>__{conrad }
<D>__{for trying to off myself? don't you sit there and stare at me. what for?}
