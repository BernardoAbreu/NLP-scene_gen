<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{y'all wanna talk about crime? well i could tell y'all things. names. locations. what boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. who's gonna get cut up and why. ...but what i got to know is, if 'n when i do this... if i wear your dog collar... y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'cause the truth is, you need me. you ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{y'all need me... i got the devil's address.}
<A>__{reverse: we're in a hotel suite. shades down. full of agents: fbi, atf, dea, secret service. law enforcement everywhere. on the furniture, against the wall, sitting on the floor. staring at jesse in silence. bud stands by the door with braddock. and fitch steps forward, laughs nervously...}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{okay, great... thanks. thank you, jesse, for that. and thank you, everyone for attending...}

<C>__{dea}
<D>__{those murders were drug related. dea's got to do follow ups.}
<C>__{secret service}
<D>__{he was printing counterfeit money. that's secret service.}
<A>__{arguing ensues, agents' voices step over one another. fitch tries to take control. jesse's been silent, until...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{there's a hit list.}
<A>__{fitch hears this. he turns, loudly to the room...}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{wait! wait a minute, quiet! everyone quiet!}
<A>__{and everything stops. fitch moves to jesse:}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{a hit list. there's much as twelve. might be one or two less now, i ain't sure. some could've already been gotten.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(to braddock)}
<D>__{now we're talkin'.}
<A>__{fbi #2 approaches jesse...}
<D>__{fbi #2 why these twelve, jesse?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{different reasons. it ain't so much why or what they done that matters. pick any one of 'em off that list, ab puts you on salary.}
<A>__{everyone is suddenly interested. bud sees this.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and you, sir, if i ain't mistaken... you're mr. nokes, right?}

<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{first u.s. attorney, john nokes?}
<C>__{nokes}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well, last time i seen it...you was number two on that list.}
<A>__{it's quiet. nokes thinks. then laughs and approaches jesse.}
<C>__{nokes}
<D>__{can you fill us in on the rest of those names, jesse?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yes, i can. but there's something i gotta make clear 'fore that happens.}
<C>__{nokes}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i've listened to you, mr. nokes. and i've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he }
<P>__{(motions to bud)}
<D>__{ tells me to.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want y'all to know that.}
<A>__{jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a chill falls over the room.}
<C>__{nokes}
<P>__{(to bud)}
<D>__{how's that fly by you, lieutenant?}
<A>__{bud simply nods.}
<C>__{nokes}
<D>__{i will sponsor him. jesse's welfare will come out of our budget. anyone has pending cases or leads for jesse, see me. i will loan him out.}
<A>__{jesse stares at nokes. as the meeting settles back to a comfortable level...}
<C>__{nokes}
<D>__{and, jesse... i'm a little pissed i'm number two on that list. who the fuck is number one?}
<A>__{the room erupts with laughter. everyone except bud and jesse.}
