<L>__{interior hospital gift shop day}
<A>__{a postcard shows a beautiful young girl in a bikini straddling a surfboard, laughing as she's splashed. barely containing his rage, matt stares at postcard before grabbing all the postcards in that rack. at the counter about to pay for the postcards and two sodas, matt notices a headline atop a stack of newspapers: "activists continue protest of kaua'i sale."}
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<D>__{hey, they all the same cards. you like buy all the same cards?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{these are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. this girl is underage. why do you sell postcards like this? this is a hospital. these aren't get well cards.}
<A>__{the shopkeeper blinks at the man weirdly accosting her.}
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<D>__{you like buy all the cards? or you want i put them back?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(pulling out his wallet)}
<D>__{never mind. yes, i'm buying them. and these two sodas.}
<A>__{as she rings him up }
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<D>__{okay, you buy underage girl all for yourself.}
<A>__{in the lobby just outside the store, he drops the stack of postcards into the garbage.}
