<D>__{can you imaging eli doing a world war i picture without horses? do you know the gags i could do with four runaway horses pulling a caisson?}
<A>__{cameron sailing into the shot. chuck ducks slightly, catching cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. cameron lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building. chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. the church steeple can be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the building).}

<P>__{(climbing to his feet)}
<D>__{what's eli got against horses? i love horses.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{don't butter me up.}
<A>__{cameron goes running at chuck and once again flies over his shoulder. sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see chuck strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. cameron scrambles to follow.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(as he walks)}
<D>__{we'll draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here, while you're rolling. now there's nothing very difficult. but this is where you gotta think. your mind can't be on snatch. it's gotta be on grabbing that gutter.}
<A>__{they have reached the lower edge of the roof. cameron looks down at the drop.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{or my brains are all over the pavement again, right?}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{you know a good falling horse makes more money in four minutes than a bank president does in a year?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{picture's not over. maybe you'll still get your chance.}
<A>__{chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the crew is setting up a shot in a room below.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{naw, all they care about is story.}
