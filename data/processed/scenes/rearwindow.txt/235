<A>__{the long focus lens brings miss lonely hearts into an enlarged picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed. a pair of ill fitting, horn rimmed reading glasses rest half way down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lip stick, with their aid. satisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face as a whole, through squinting eyes. she has faded good looks, has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. her hair do makes her seem middle aged. she reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a long drink. putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. she puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. she walks into the living room, finishing the drink. the long focus lens moves with her. she goes straight for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. then she leaves the apartment, with a show of determination. she turns out the lights behind her.}
