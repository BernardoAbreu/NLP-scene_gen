<L>__{exterior wheatley house day}
<A>__{frank and karl walk up the steps to the house. frank opens the door and they enter.}
<L>__{interior house day}
<A>__{as frank and karl enter, they see doyle sitting on a footstool facing linda who's in a chair. doyle is holding both her hands and talking very softly to her. he sees the guys and looks up.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well, i will be damned, there's the boys. i'm glad y'all came in. i wanted to talk to y'all, too. i was just tellin' linda here oh hell, i will just start over, set down you boys.}
<A>__{they do, on the couch.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{well, what it is is, i just, well i took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk. i guess you'd say i'm really here to apologize, which ain't easy for me to do, about the way i acted the other night. i was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another. i care about y'all a lot, i do. i don't mean to be so damned, assholish i guess the word would be. now karl, i don't believe i hit you, did i? so no apology needed there i guess, but frank, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i hit your mama. i'm just jealous of her. i don't like her life or the way she runs it. i don't like homosexuals and she buddies with one. i don't like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' mental retards and she's got one of each livin' with her.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i was just kiddin'. but really i guess people need to get along even if they have differences.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see, i work construction. i build things. do you realize how important that is to the world. i have a lot of pressure on me. the upshot is, i'm gonna spend a lot more time over here and we're gonna get along. like a family should.}
<P>__{(to linda)}
<D>__{i may even surprise you one day and pop the question.}
<P>__{(he gets up)}
<D>__{well, i'm goin' back to work. i just wanted to give y'all some little piece of happiness today.}
<P>__{(kisses linda)}
<D>__{see you tonight honey. karl. be a good boy, frank.}
<A>__{he leaves.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{well, at least he's tryin'. but who knows for how long.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he's lyin' mama. he ain't gonna do better.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i know honey. just remember what i said, we'll bide our time. you just steer clear of him as much as you can. doyle's had a real hard life. it's just about run him crazy i think.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we've had a real hard life, too, mama.}
<A>__{linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around frank.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you're a hell of a boy, frank. someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. and karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. what do you think about that?}
