<A>__{knowing her way around here, miranda keeps a steady pace as she heads towards her old office. she turns a corner and stops in her tracks: another janitor making his rounds. she waits until he's out of sight and rushes to her office. she pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the lock. starts unscrewing the screws. she does this as fast as she can, but she's no professional so it takes a few tries. she loosens one screw, then another and clumsily drops the screwdriver. the metal echoes against the floor. miranda sucks her breath in, waits. no footsteps. she bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for balance. it easily turns in her hand. it was open all along. she simply forgot to check.}
