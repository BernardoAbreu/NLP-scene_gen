<A>__{andrew marsh lies on his back in bed. he is a frail looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair. on top of him is a much younger woman. although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side. we see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman. she moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts. she reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her. they move together faster and faster. the camera slowly begins to pull back. as it does we see what we are watching is on a television. further back still. we see two uniformed police officers standing before the television watching the act. the camera begins to pan around the room. rain streaks down the windows of the room lightning flashes outside. a video camera is set up on a tripod. more plain clothes police, looking, dusting, talking. we continue to pan. we can now see it is the same room on the tape. on the bed lies the naked body of andrew marsh, a sheet covering his lower torso. his face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare. the last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.}
