<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{as they burst into the room, they see holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand. he has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{mr. holmes...}
<A>__{holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. as mrs. hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{please, mrs. hudson. you're in my line of fire.}
<A>__{watson jerks mrs. hudson back as holmes lets go with another shot. the bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass and liquid all over the place. holmes rises calmly from the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away in a drawer.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{how many times have i told you i will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? i should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall.}
<A>__{she points up to a spot near the ceiling. neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials v.r., with a small crown above them.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{merely celebrating her majesty's golden jubilee.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{look at that mess you made }
<A>__{watson is looking at holmes with a little smile on his face.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it's all right, mrs. hudson. i will clean it up }
<P>__{(hands her the diploma)}
<D>__{ while you unpack my things.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{unpack?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you heard him.}
<A>__{a bewildered mrs. hudson goes back into the bedroom. watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{thank you, holmes. i know how difficult it must've been for you }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{not really. it was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you've made me very happy.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. i admit to it. and yet, in my cold, unemotional way, i'm very fond of you, watson.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i know that. but one likes to hear these things occasionally.}
<A>__{he notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{look at this. covered with that nasty stuff. i'd better dry it off.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{he takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{for a moment, i was worried that you were going to let me walk out that you weren't even going to try to stop me.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now, watson you know there's nothing i wouldn't do to keep you here.}
<A>__{with a side glance at the busy watson, he opens the violin case. neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics. the ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set. he places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks. as he moves off, we stay on the violin case.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{it was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that. normally, i was inclined to forgive him...}
