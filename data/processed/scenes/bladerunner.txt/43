<L>__{interior doctor wheeler's office afternoon}
<A>__{the good doctor is bending over his glass top desk which resembles a pin ball machine. displayed under its surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and read outs indicating the results of the test. deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to the doctor's desk.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{so how did i do?}
<A>__{dr. wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise of compassion in his sunken eyes.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{nerves of steel.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no rust?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{i didn't say that. your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.}
<A>__{deckard starts to dress.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{during the road test...}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{your mind kept wandering. that bothered me.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{huh huh.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{true.}
<A>__{wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger comes down on the section illuminating deckard's simple statistics.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{you got a birthday coming up.}
<A>__{deckard bends over slipping on his shoes. wheeler looks up, concerned.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{but you haven't put in for emigration.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{you're going to be over the limit.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{listen, i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{what if you change your mind?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{they'll change the limit before i change my mind.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{never been more sure of anything in my life.}
<A>__{deckard is ready to go. looking at wheeler, a little touched with his concern.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why didn't you go?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{too old.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{but if you could?}
<A>__{wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{my job is here.}

<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{they shake hands and deckard walks.}
