<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey! over here!}
<A>__{they start for him when another drum explodes, flattening them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing arc. the flame has cut them off from the hose. stephen sees what brian's thinking.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{wait for another hose team...}
<A>__{but brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{wait for the goddamn hose team!}
<A>__{brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and slides down to the factory floor. he's heading for the hoseline when wham! the fire cuts him off. not just any fire. that same one from so many years ago. don't fuck with me, kid. i'm not in the mood. nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames spinning slowly upside down just like his father's. brian stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. same old little kid with his finger up his ass. then something different comes into brian's eyes.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no... no more.}
<A>__{there's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the pole. brian lifts it, approaches the fire. you can practically hear the flames laugh at him. brian suddenly turns and slams the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, breaking it off before heaving the cannister hissing into the flames where it explodes a cloud of extinguisher powder that stuns the flames just long enough for brian to dash through and tackle the hose. the fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill just as brian spins and hits it with the stream. and it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple with each other pengelly and nightengale have an opening, and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to stephen because the fire doesn't care it only has eyes for brian now and stephen sees brian tackle the monster, and his eyes fill with tears and the fire's pushing brian pushing him with the fury of a frightened street bully but brian won't give and now the fire's back's broken it's whimpering, dying. and pengelly and nightengale have climbed up to stephen now, pulling him away.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that's my brother! that's my brother goddamn it!}
<A>__{and the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as brian steps up with the hoseline.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{another time, friend.}
<A>__{and whoosh, it's gone.}
