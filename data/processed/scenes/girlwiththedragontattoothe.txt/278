<A>__{blomkvist and salander sit out by the water, sharing the last cigarette in his pack. her arm is draped over his shoulder, which strikes him as the most tender of gestures, coming from her.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{fuck these people ...}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{yeah ...}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{harriet most of all.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{if she'd done anything but run, martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{she had no idea he was doing it.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{she should have killed her father and him.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that's what you would've done. not everyone's you.}
<A>__{she's not sure she likes the comment. decides she doesn't. takes her arm away from his shoulder.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that was meant to be a compliment. put your arm back on my shoulder.}
<A>__{she doesn't. so he drapes his on hers. then }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{what happened with wennerstrom. how did he get you?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i was stupid. i got something from an anonymous source, who i'm sure now worked for him. it was fake. which he easily proved in court.}
<A>__{not a good day, that. then }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{you were emphatic that the way i looked into your life was illegal and immoral. would you feel the same about wennerstrom?}
<A>__{he regards her, uncertain what she means ...}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i started investigating him on my own. then you showed up and hired me. i haven't had a chance to look at it all you and harriet fucking vanger have kept me busy ... but i may have something.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{on wennerstrom.}
<A>__{she nods. then rests her head on his shoulder.}
