<A>__{silberman's smug composure drops a second. then returns.}
<C>__{silberman}
<D>__{fine, sarah.}
<P>__{(he switches off, speaks to the interns)}
<D>__{she, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a screwdriver a few weeks ago.}
<A>__{sarah watches them talking about her through the glass, but can't hear them. she feels like a lab animal. the interns look in at her through the glass as silberman talks. with her face drawn, eyes haggard and hair wild, she looks like she belongs where she is.}
<C>__{silberman}
<D>__{the delusional architecture is interesting. she believes a machine called a "terminator", which looks human of course, was sent back though time to kill her. and also that the father of her child was a soldier, sent to protect her... he was from the future too...}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{the year 2029, if i remember correctly.}
<P>__{(the interns chuckle)}
<D>__{let's move on, shall we?}
<A>__{as the interns walk on, silberman steps close to douglas, the head attendant, and speaks low.}
<C>__{silberman}
<D>__{douglas, i don't like seeing the patients disturbing their rooms like this. see that she takes her thorazine, would you?}
<A>__{douglas is 6'4", 250 pounds and warm hearted at a rattlesnake. he nods, catching silberman's meaning, and gestures for the other attendants to hang back as silberman moves on in his rounds.}
