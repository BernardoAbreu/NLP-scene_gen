<D>__{.....fucking assholes! fucking pig shit food! fuck you! fuck you! fuck...}

<A>__{rachel walks in and finds a flushed david wiping oatmeal off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{at this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back.}
<A>__{living room later rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift, watching vogel who is slumped asleep. he looks dishevelled, the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin. she can't delay the moment anymore. she takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside her and walks towards vogel, stirring the bowl with an unsteady hand. she kneels down in front of him. in the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside. vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes. she takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes the food from his chin. finally she removes the tape from his mouth. vogel watches her without moving. she offers him a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and abuse. he says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently. rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal. he speaks to rachel in german, subtitled.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{my wife.}
<A>__{rachel ignores him, feeds him another spoonful.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{is she hurt?}
<A>__{another spoonful, and another.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{is she alright?}
<A>__{an alarm clock on the table, rings the end of her shift. she wipes his mouth, tears some tape from the roll. vogel closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops rachel.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{please? tell me she's alright.}
<A>__{rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands. david walks in and takes his place in the armchair facing vogel. rachel begins to leave. she looks back at vogel who is staring after her, eyes pleading. she hesitates then gives a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her. kitchen continuous rachel starts to wash the oatmeal bowl. stephan follows her in.}

<A>__{living room day stephan sits on the armchair in front of vogel, taking the gun apart, cleaning it. living room day vogel thrashes around on the floor as best he can, david holding him down. stephan tries to force oatmeal into him. he spits it back out. kitchen day rachel is cleaning, trying to keep busy, trying to keep the encroaching decay of the kitchen at bay, scrubbing and scrubbing. hallway morning an exhausted david, finishing his shift, walks out of the living room as stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his place. rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for a moment the three criss crossing each other's paths. rachel's bedroom door closes. both men avoid looking at each other as they pass it. hallway morning stephan and david are carrying a struggling, cursing vogel towards the bathroom. before they can get there vogel pisses himself, the urine puddling on the floor at their feet.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{stephan drops vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way. vogel lies in the pool, staring up at him, eyes triumphant.}
