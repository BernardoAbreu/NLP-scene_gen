<A>__{maurice as he walks down a winding highway. his new sneakers shuffling slowly. a sharp pain shoots up maurice's leg. his knees buckle. the shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by maurice himself. from a distance it looks like he's been shot. maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten his leg out... his face frozen in a painful expression. maurice rubs his legs slowly working the cramp out. he relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg. maurice sits there motionless eyes glazed... defeated. the sounds of a bird snap him out of his trance. he looks up to see a painted bunting, a bird about six inches in height fly down from a tree and land on a rock next to him. maurice stares at the beautiful bird curiously. its body splashed with brilliant blues, reds and greens. it looks out of place in these mundane surroundings. maurice looks around the skies to see no other birds. the painted bunting chirps a few times before taking flight into the air. it circles over maurice before disappearing behind the trees. maurice smiles. he pulls himself to his feet with great effort. maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the essentials the maps, food, a canister of water. maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with great effort. at his feet, are the rest of his belonging piled on the side of the road. maurice painfully begins walking again. we pull back on maurice's figure walking on the highway... the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... the highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles into a fixed dot in the distance.}
