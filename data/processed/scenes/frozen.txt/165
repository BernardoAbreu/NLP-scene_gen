<A>__{parker drags her devastated body into the street. just as she gets there.... beep! a honking car races past with it's windshield wipers blaring. narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road. there are no more cars to be seen. she is alone. all that she can do is clutch the ground. and then... another car approaches in the distance. she holds her hand up weakly.}
