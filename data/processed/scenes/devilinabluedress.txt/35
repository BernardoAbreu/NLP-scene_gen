<A>__{the lights from the pier can be seen in the distance as easy parks his car. and the voices of teenagers in raucous conversation can be heard above glenn miller's big band playing "silhouette in the moonlight" on the jukebox. easy gets out and starts toward the pier.}

<A>__{easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing that looks out over the ocean.}

<C>__{football}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{and he whirls around to albright's smiling face, just in time to see him pull that rifle like pistol from inside his coat, leveling it at his eyes.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i want to see brains. i want you to die for me.}
<A>__{albright cocks the hammer. it sounds like a bone breaking, and barbara starts crying in her sister's arms.}

<D>__{sick bastard.}
<A>__{thunk! he smacks him again, and blood is everywhere.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{get out of here. you call the cops, i will kill ya!}

<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i don't think they'd dare call the cops.}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{but it'll cost me a few bucks if they do.}
<A>__{he claps easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand. easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his anger in tightly clenched jaws.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{what you got, easy?}
<C>__{easy}
