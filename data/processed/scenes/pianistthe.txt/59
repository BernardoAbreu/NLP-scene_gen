<A>__{the szpilmans near the train. the first trucks are already full, the people inside pressed close together, ss men pushing them with their rifle butts. people in the trucks cry out in desperation. the szpilmans are pushed along by ss men along the cordon of jewish policemen, past loaded trucks. then, suddenly:}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{szpilman! szpilman!}
<A>__{a jewish policeman grabs szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon. it's heller. the rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. a scuffle as szpilman tries to resist. another jewish policeman shoves him. szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him the closed ranks of the jewish policemen's backs. he stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, shoulders, mother, regina, henryk and halina clambering into the trucks. father is looking around, bewildered.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{papa!}
<A>__{father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, smiling helplessly. he raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks. again, szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{papa! mama! halina!}
<A>__{heller turns on him.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing, szpilman? i've saved your life! now, go on, save yourself!}
<A>__{szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. then he turns and starts to run.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{don't run!}
<A>__{szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall. szpilman falls in with them and they pass through the gates.}
