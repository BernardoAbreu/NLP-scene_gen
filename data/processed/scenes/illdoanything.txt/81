<L>__{interior cathy's outer office day}
<A>__{several people milling about... matt eyes cathy. we still hear jeannie's muffled singing from the other side of the door.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{i have to talk to you.}
<L>__{exterior popcorn pictures day}
<A>__{as matt and cathy come into frame... matt forcefully placing her with her back to the wall. she is not one to be pushed around.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{don't!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what in hell is wrong with you? you actually think...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i'm trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(continuing right along)}
<D>__{...that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i didn't... she went for water and by the time she got back, they had offered her the part. blame burke, he was there...}
<A>__{matt takes this in. just a millimeter underneath his fury is professional curiosity.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what's the part, anyway?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{the white kid in a multi racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages. it's not a bad show. i sure can't wait to see the test.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how were they able to test her so fast?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{no. they offered it to her off the reading. i meant your test.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh... a child actor. just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out a series of her own...}
<A>__{cathy has nothing to offer. matt begins leading her back. we hold on their backs and see the chink in matt's confidence, hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you'll let me know as soon as they see my test?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{right away... you've got my vote.}
<A>__{they hold hands.}
