<L>__{exterior football field the game night}
<A>__{everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field. charles jefferson is poised on the offensive line. he mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing lincoln player. the ball is snapped, and charles jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. the lincoln player is hit and keels over. charles jefferson sets up for another play. the ball is snapped. ka boom. down falls another lincoln player. jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them. there is pure madness in his eyes. it has taken him over. the ridgemont points rack up. jefferson is single handedly maiming lincoln for homecoming.}
