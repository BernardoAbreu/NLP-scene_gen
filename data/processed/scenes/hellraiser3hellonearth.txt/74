<L>__{interior inner city church night}
<A>__{the church is in semi darkness. some candles at an offertory, some others on an altar, provide the only light. on the very front pew a priest sits, head bent low in prayer. the priest is a young man. probably a good man. we're not really going to have the time to find out. a shadow seems to pass over the priest's bowed head. at first, it seems he hasn't noticed. then he looks up, a little puzzled. he looks to his right, his left, then shifts in the pew to look back along the central aisle. there are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the church door ... which is ajar. the priest stands, walks to the start of the aisle, and looks back along it again.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(calling down aisle)}
<D>__{is there anyone there? hello?}
<A>__{silence. a beat. the priest looks puzzled. we see his mind work. he's looked right, looked left, looked down ... how about ...? he turns right round to face the altar. priest's pov to the priest, it's an image of nightmarish blasphemy. even to us heathens, it's pretty shocking; pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{how dare you!}
<A>__{it gets worse. pinhead, staring at the priest all the while, reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract one of the pins from his skull. the pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm dark, slimy, and befanged. pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin tail behind it. he repeats the operation with the other palm. he turns his palms out to show the priest in a blasphemous parody of christ's stigmata.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i am the way.}
<A>__{the priest rushes up to the altar to pinhead.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you'll burn in hell for this!}
<A>__{the priest reaches him. pinhead's hand is on his throat instantly, squeezing silence from him.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{burn? what a limited imagination.}
<A>__{the choking priest kicks and struggles as pinhead forces him to his knees before him. pinhead towers over the priest. he smiles. with his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from the decorative wounds on his chest. he holds the bloody piece of meat up.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this is my body. this is my blood. happy are they who come to my supper.}
<A>__{pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh into the priest's aghast mouth. pinhead flings the priest away from him. the priest lands heavily on the floor. pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside. all the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing through the church. pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi conscious priest. and all the candles go out.}
