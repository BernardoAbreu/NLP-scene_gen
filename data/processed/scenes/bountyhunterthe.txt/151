<A>__{next to an ambulance, milo is unconscious on a stretcher. an emt prepares a huge syringe, picks a spot on milo's chest, then plunges the needle into it. milo jerks up on a gurney, gasping for air.}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{relax. that was an adrenaline shot.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i don't believe it. she tried to kill me.}
<A>__{the emt exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then helps milo off the stretcher.}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{no one tried to kill you, buddy. you just need to be more careful about what you eat.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{thanks. great tip.}
<A>__{he checks his watch, then pulls out the green matchbook:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{know where this place is?}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{sure. charley's, on the boardwalk. and just fyi: when they say "don't touch" the dancers, they mean with with any part of your body, not just your hands.}
<A>__{the emt folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and they drive away, leaving milo in the parking lot.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(calling after them, sarcastic)}
<D>__{thanks for the ride, by the way.}
<A>__{milo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one that's open and slips inside.}
