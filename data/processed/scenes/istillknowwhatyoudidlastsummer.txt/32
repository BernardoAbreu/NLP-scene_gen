<L>__{exterior country highway night}
<A>__{we stare out at a rain soaked stretch of road. a pickup roars past, cruising along with its radio loud and windows rolled down.}
<L>__{interior ray's pickup night}

<A>__{ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy himself... then, ray sees something in the road ahead. he turns down the radio. they both stare ray's pov: a car turned sideways its hazards blinking. ray slows and creeps past the car. the driver's door is open. it appears empty.}
