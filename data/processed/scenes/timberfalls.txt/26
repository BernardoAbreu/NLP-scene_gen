<L>__{20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. they are followed by...}
<A>__{brody, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{looks like we got ourselves a little party.}
<A>__{brody and darryl ogle sheryl. she tucks herself behind mike, who shifts quickly into protective mode. she snaps her bra back closed.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we were just moving our way up the mountain.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{you were moving your way'round more than just that.}
<A>__{sheryl eyes her discarded clothes. darryl spots them too. he grabs the shorts, sniffs them.}
<C>__{darryl}
<P>__{(referring to the smell)}
<D>__{like a peach.}
<A>__{mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you folks best be careful about what you do up here... never know who's watching.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{appreciate the advice...i think we learned our lesson.}
<A>__{brody nods as he looks them up and down.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{you city folk, ain't ya? up from charleston roughing it, seeing how the "other" half lives?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, we're from virginia, just up for a weekend trip. and, uh... you folks live up here?}
<A>__{brody glances at darryl and lonnie, then back at mike.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it's easy to spot the city folk. it's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think you just startled us is all.}
<A>__{sheryl looks over at... ...lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly flails it about. uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we'll just be on our way.}
<P>__{(re: sheryl's shorts)}
<D>__{may i have those?}
<A>__{a bold move from mike.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{finders keepers.}
<A>__{long beat. tension high.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{darryl.}
<A>__{brody concedes, gestures to darryl to give the shorts back. darryl reluctantly obliges. mike passes them to sheryl who slides them on. darryl and lonnie soak in every inch of sheryl as she does. mike takes sheryl's hand. they make a move, but... brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where you runnin' off to?}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{yeah, we just getting acquainted and shit.}
<A>__{mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest. he can no longer hide his fear.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we just want to get a little further along before the sun sets.}
<A>__{darryl eyes the sky. the sun beams down through the trees.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{plenty of time'fore that.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{look. we don't want any trouble. we just want to be on our way...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{and why do you suppose we mean to make trouble?}
<A>__{mike looks down at the gun. brody smiles a yellow smile.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you folks enjoy the spirits?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{excuse me? the what?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{spirits.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{booze!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sure. yeah.}
<A>__{brody hands darryl the shotgun and drops his sack. brody pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{why don't you try a taste of this?}
<A>__{brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to mike. mike eyes sheryl. clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea. mike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip. he squirms, winces, but forces it down. mike turns red and coughs. brody and darryl are loving it.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{betcha never tasted nuthin'like that?}
<A>__{darryl would win that bet.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{fifty bucks.}
<A>__{mike has no idea what he's talking about.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i will sell you the jar for fifty bucks.}
<C>__{darryl}
<P>__{(ogles sheryl)}
<D>__{or maybe we could do us a little trade.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{let me get my wallet.}
<A>__{mike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around. angle on inside the bag... the .38 revolver. mike thinks about grabbing it. sheryl shocked to see the gun. she tenses up. angle on brody. the shotgun. mike thinks, then...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{fifty bucks sounds like a bargain.}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{pay the man.}
<A>__{mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet. he counts out the cash, hands it to brody. brody smiles, hands the jar to mike.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{pleasure doing business with ya. take care now.}
<A>__{brody nods at mike and sheryl, walks off down the trail. darryl grins at sheryl, follows brody.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{should you tire of your present company... just holla and i will come running with bells on darling.}
<A>__{he smiles a creepy wide smile. he turns and catches up to the others. once they are out of sight... mike takes a moment to gather himself. sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground, puts it on.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you brought a gun?}
<A>__{no response. sheryl picks up her towel and bandana.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{why did you bring a gun?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{same reason you brought your cellphone. better to have it and not need it. to protect us.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{lotta good it just did.}
<A>__{sheryl turns from mike, walks back to the path.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(then, call out)}

<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{sheryl? i'm sorry.}
