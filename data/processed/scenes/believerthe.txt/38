<A>__{danny and billings see people in back. now nine young men and a bulldog come to greet them: survivalists, speed freaks, skinheads...and one blank loner (drake) with a blue swastika tattooed to his lips like a tiny kiss. a case of steroid excess fixes his gaze on danny.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we're from new york. curtis zampf invited us.}
<C>__{whit}
<D>__{who?... curtis who?}
<A>__{are they in the wrong place? then someone laughs, they all relax, exchange greetings, obscure handshakes. everyone's just getting comfortable when, for no apparent reason...}
<B>__{steroid excess}
<A>__{slugs danny in the face. he stumbles backward. the others crowd around, keep him from falling, also from getting away. billings starts to help, but people grab him: this is danny's problem. steroid comes at him.... danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger man's body. we barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious. in seconds, steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. danny holds up him, leans close:}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{enough?}
<A>__{steroid mumbles in the affirmative. danny nods then hits him four more shots to the face. even this crowd winces. steroid drops with a wet thud. as danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{which was his room?}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(ferrety, glasses)}
<D>__{number ten.}
<A>__{on the end: has an extra window. danny walks into the room. steroid's stuff starts flying out the door.}
