<A>__{moving quickly, dyle lashes out and hacks scobie's gun hand with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof. following through, dyle punches the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, scobie wraps his arm around dyle, holding on tightly until his head clears. then, to his amazement, dyle is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear hold, carried toward the edge of the roof. working his arms between their two bodies, dyle suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as scobie's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of dyle's back to his shoulder. both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark. now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. close shot their hands two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun. med. shot dyle and scobie the battle is going to scobie whose weight and strength are beginning to tire dyle, who is now on his back, trying to stop scobie from crawling over him. he has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last ditch effort to hold him. but scobie, his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun. suddenly, dyle releases his hold. with nothing restraining him, scobie lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down. scobie beats wildly at the the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip. close shot scobie's claw as it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly. med. shot scobie as he slides over the edge and disappears. close shot dyle as he watches, hypnotized. close shot roof edge there appears to be no sign of scobie. then camera zooms in for a tight close shot of scobie's metal hand, gripping the rain gutter at the very edge. med. shot dyle having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof.}
