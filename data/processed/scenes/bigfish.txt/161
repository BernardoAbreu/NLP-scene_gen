<L>__{interior jenny's kitchen day}
<A>__{while will sips his iced tea, jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. she hands it back to will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how did you know my father?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. everyone in town knew him.}
<A>__{a beat. not flinching...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{were you and my father having an affair?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{wow. wow, you just said it. i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i've seen him with women. he flirts. he always has. on some level, i presumed he was cheating on my mother. i just never had proof.}
<A>__{she moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her into. once she's finally free...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i ask you a question? why did you come here today? if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{because he's dying.}
<A>__{a long beat. jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. she's a tangle of conflicting emotions.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{look, i don't know how much you want to know about any of this. you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. especially this late in the game.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{my father talked about a lot of things he never did, and i'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. i'm just trying to reconcile the two.}
<A>__{fair enough. jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here. and yet he did, twice. the first time, he was early. the second time, he was late.}
