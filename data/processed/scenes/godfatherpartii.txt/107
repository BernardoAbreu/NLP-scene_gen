<L>__{interior michael's house night}
<A>__{kay, the children, and some women servants have come down from the various rooms into the central living area, that can be most easily secured. the little girl is still asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a central room. michael goes up to kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it will be all right. we were lucky.}
<A>__{she says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels over the jeopardy michael has placed his children in. she holds her young daughter in her arms. the door opens, and rocco enters. he quickly realizes he is holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and puts it away. michael moves to him, and they talk a distance away from kay.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your mother's still sleeping.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{no sign of them yet; but they're still on the estate.}
<A>__{we hear loud shouting from outside.}
<C>__{deanna }
<D>__{goddamn you! you're all nuts here, i'm not goin' to calm down...}
<A>__{michael's view through the door, that rocco opens. deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the gunshots; while fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back into the house.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{deanna, will you get back into the house!}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{i'm getting out of here i said; these guys all have guns!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{fredo, can't you shut that woman up!}
<P>__{(to rocco's men)}
<D>__{get her in here!}
<A>__{the bodyguards, gracefully help fredo bring the hysterical deanna into the safety of the house.}
<C>__{deanna}
<P>__{(whimpering)}
<D>__{i don't want to stay here...}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{mike, what can i do, she's a hysterical woman...}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{leave her alone! you're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(to rocco)}
<D>__{have tom hagen meet me in the harbor house.}
