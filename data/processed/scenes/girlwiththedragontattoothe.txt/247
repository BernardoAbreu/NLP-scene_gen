<A>__{as salander gets the door open with her key and comes in }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{mikael ?}
<A>__{he's clearly not here. she goes to the closet. takes out the surveillance pc. puts it on the desk next to blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying not the photo of martin he left for her but the apple default "light spider" screen saver. as salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{so what would you like to know?}
<A>__{there are so many things, but also no point, so blomkvist says nothing.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you're the journalist, ask me something.}
<A>__{nothing from blomkvist. which is okay with martin; he can do this alone }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what do i do with my guests? is that the question? well, before i do what we're doing. relax, have a drink, converse. i like that part a lot having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. after i simply get rid of them. out to sea }
<P>__{(points off)}
<D>__{ unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. that's not smart if you ask me. that's just garish and loud. but he was a garish and loud man. frankly, he got what he deserved.}
<A>__{nothing from blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you can't be a sloppy technician like that. you can't drink to excess like he did. this takes discipline. it's a science of a thousand details. the planning. the execution. the cleanup. i'm sure i don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess.}
<A>__{nothing from blomkvist, but martin nods. ("how do you do this and still function in normal society?")}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's the interesting thing. because most of the time i am just like everyone else. i just have a bigger secret. it's wonderful really standing there waiting for a train or on a street corner as people brush past me. you know what i mean;}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{you have secrets. you had one when you came up here. it made you feel special. didn't it?}
<A>__{blomkvist doesn't say. martin is a little thrown by blomkvist's next unspoken comment ("yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder")}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no. i'm not a rapist. of course i do that too and at one time it was enough but }
<P>__{(gathers his thoughts to explain it)}
<D>__{a rapist, mikael, gets off on domination. i need ...}
<P>__{(discards a few other words before:)}
<D>__{ destruction.}
<A>__{martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing blomkvist further with a block and tackle contraption of chains and straps.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{can i ask you something? why don't people trust their instincts? they sense something's wrong someone's walking too close behind them yet they don't cross the street. you knew something was wrong you even knew what it was but you came back into the house. did i force you? did i grab you and drag you in? i just offered you a drink.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain but you know what? it is. they always come willingly.}
<A>__{it amazes him. it always amazes him. he keeps working.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and then they're here. they know it's over like you do and still somehow think they have a chance. "maybe if i say the right thing if i'm polite or i cry and beg maybe i will survive."}
<P>__{(regards blomkvist)}
<D>__{and then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{and when that happens when i see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now }
<P>__{(whispers like it's just between them)}
<D>__{ well, i feel myself getting hard just watching it.}
<A>__{silence ...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{say something.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you are a sick fuck.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{... is this an interview or an editorial?}
<A>__{blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ... ("martin, civilized people don't do what you do.")}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you're right, this behavior is unacceptable. i know that. but we're not completely different. we both have desires. satisfying mine just requires more towels.}
<A>__{martin regards blomkvist in a silence. then }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{anything else you want to know?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you sure?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right. whatever you say.}
<A>__{he yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift blomkvist up onto his feet }
