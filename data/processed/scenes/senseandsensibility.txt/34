<L>__{interior norland park breakfast room day}
<A>__{fanny is standing by the window looking out. we see her pov of elinor and edward walking in the garden. mrs dashwood enters, pauses for a moment and then joins fanny at the window. fanny pretends not to have been watching but mrs dashwood looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly at her.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{we are all so happy that you chose to invite edward to norland. he is a dear boy and we are all very fond of him.}
<A>__{fanny does a bit of quick thinking.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{we have great hopes for him. much is expected of him by our mother with regard to his profession}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{naturally.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{and in marriage. she is determined that both he and robert will marry well.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{of course. but i hope she desires them to marry for love, first and foremost? i have always felt that, contrary to common wisdom, true affection is by far the most valuable dowry.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{love is all very well, but unfortunately we cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable directions.}
<A>__{fanny lowers her voice confidingly.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{you see, my dear mrs dashwood, edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never go back on his word. he is quite simply incapable of doing so. but it would lead to his ruin. i worry for him so, mrs dashwood. my mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less... exalted ground than he deserves.}
<A>__{it is impossible for mrs dashwood not to get the pointerior she is appalled and furious.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i understand you perfectly.}
<A>__{she sweeps off.}
