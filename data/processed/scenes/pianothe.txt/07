<A>__{ada no longer struggles. she is stiff and still. baines intoxicated by the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. he kisses and touches her with feeling and affection. then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still. he pulls himself up to see whether her face betrays her feelings. ada seizes this opportunity to return to the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. from the bed, baines watches her run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture betraying affection never afforded to him. baines gets up. he shuts the piano lid forcing ada to remove her hand. ada immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully baines' ownership of her piano. sc 63 exterior stewart's hut sunsetsc 63 a golden evening. stewart in his best shirt and trousers prepares the horse and cart. sc 64 interior stewart's hut ada's bedroom sunsetsc 64 inside flora is in her finished angel costume, she sings softly to herself while ada undoes the long strands of plaits and separates them to comb.}

<A>__{stewart comes in to put on his jacket, but the collar is all tucked in. ada automatically adjusts it for him, settling it around his neck. her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. in an impassioned impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ada's finger tips. the gesture falters as ada, surprised, jumps back. sc 65 exterior school hall dusk sc 65 people are arriving at the school hall. one family is being ferried through the mud in a wheelbarrow.}
