<L>__{intouriste bureau}
<A>__{it is a typical travel bureau. behind the counter are attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets. leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says "visas and passport department." he enters.}
<L>__{interior, visa room}
<A>__{it is a room smaller than the previous one. behind the counter stands a typical bolshevik official. in front of the counter is an elderly english lady. leon takes his place behind her, nervous at having to wait. the official stamps the english lady's passport and hands it to her.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{well, everything is in order. i hope you will enjoy your trip to russia, madame.}
<C>__{english lady}
<D>__{thank you. oh, by the way, i've heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in russia. is it advisable to take one's own towels?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{certainly not, madame. that's only capitalistic propaganda. we change the towel every week.}
<C>__{english lady}
<D>__{oh... thank you.}
<A>__{she leaves. leon moves up to the official.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{yes, please?}
<A>__{at this moment the telephone rings. the official takes the receiver.}
<C>__{official}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes... comrade cazabine? no, i'm sorry... he hasn't been with us for six months. he was called back to russia and was investigated. you can get further details from his widow.}
<A>__{he hangs up the receiver. leon, thinking of ninotchka, is horrified by this statement.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{pardon me, i am very interested in what you just said you mean when an envoy goes back to russia if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{not always... look at me... i've been back twice.}
<P>__{(he knocks on wood)}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(his alarm growing)}
<D>__{here's my passport.... please give me a visa. i have to leave for russia immediately.}
<C>__{official}
<P>__{(reading passport)}
<D>__{count leon d'algout... a count!... a nobleman!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{don't hold that against me... please!}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{why should an aristocrat want to go to russia?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{business.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{what business?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{private.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{there is no privacy in russia. this whole thing seems very suspicious. what's the real reason? if you ever want to get into russia, take my advice... confess!}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(dismayed)}
<D>__{confess what?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government the white russians?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{on the contrary i don't want to have anything to do with them.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{you believe in our cause?}
<A>__{leon, feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl, whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{oh... i think it's great! everyone works everyone contributes that's what i want to do work! i make my own bed you can call up my butler! i don't believe in the right of the individual. i like the bolshevik ideal everyone being the same. you just like me me just like you i use your comb you use my toothbrush oh, it's a great life.... please... give me that visa!}
<A>__{at this moment swana enters.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{hello, leon darling!}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(suavely) after our talk last night}
<D>__{i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia, i thought i might be of some assistance to you.}
<P>__{(to the official)}
<D>__{may i introduce myself? i am the duchess swana of russia... another russia.}
<A>__{the official gasps in surprise.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{now, please, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(to the official)}
<D>__{count d'algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him i will be delighted.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{that does it, swana.}
<P>__{(he leads her toward the door)}
<D>__{now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair dresser.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(stopping at the door)}
<D>__{just in case they don't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chateau in the touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{thank you, swana. you are very gracious.}
<A>__{his words are unmistakably a final dismissal. she walks out. leon looks after her for a second, then goes back to the official. he tries to laugh off the incident.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{she must have her little joke.}
<P>__{(the official responds with a stony look)}
<D>__{you're not going to take that seriously.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{the grand duchess swana... active in the white russian movement?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{believe me, i have no connection with her any longer... i swear i haven't!}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{but you had!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{listen, i want to be absolutely frank with you. i have no business in moscow.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{i think so too.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... it's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... it's a girl.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{so it's love which drags you to moscow.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{no visa.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(fighting for his point)}
<D>__{i must get into that country of yours!}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{oh no. no visa.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(more aggressively)}
<D>__{that's impossible! nobody has the right.... you can't do that!... if you don't give me that visa...}
<C>__{official}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{you're going to force us... huh?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(growing violent)}
<D>__{now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{why should i take a chance?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{on what?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{how do i know you don't want to blow up a factory?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what for... why?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{or a tunnel or a bridge...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... that's the trouble with you! if you don't let me in i will stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia!... i will picket your whole country....}
<A>__{the official laughs in a superior way.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i will boycott you, that's what i'm going to do!... no more vodka... no more caviar... no more tchaikovsky... no more borscht.... wait a minute, i know something better than that...}
<A>__{the official leans forward sarcastically.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{with a knock out blow, leon sends him to the floor, then, leaning over the counter, he shouts.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{and you can tell the kremlin that's just the beginning!}
<A>__{he strides out. the official's head emerges from the counter. as he adjusts his bruised jaw, he speaks.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{no visa.}
<A>__{establishing shot of russia first of may stock shot of may day parade on the red square}
