<D>__{sleep well?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{next time, i do the driving.}
<A>__{bond gives her a look. return on the control room harmsway and yung are locking down at the video screen of a portable version of the "worm" controller we saw on the sea dolphin ii.}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{the drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{excellent.}
<A>__{harmsway looks up, hearing:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i see you're in your natural element, harmsway: a room filled with lethal power...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...with a toxic core at its center.}
<A>__{harmsway smiles at bond and sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at gun point,) with stamper and a guard. harmsway is charming as ever:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{do come in mr. bond, sidney... you're just in time for a nuclear meltdown!}
<A>__{coming closer, sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you bastard }
<A>__{stamper restrains her, while bond scans the room for an advantage. he sees a machine pistol on the console.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{please, sidney. i'd like to remember you fondly.}
<C>__{yung}
<P>__{(calling from the console)}
<D>__{approaching the first gate.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{start the grinders.}
<A>__{underwater power plant intake tunnel the "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars. return on control room }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{...so that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{precisely, mr. bond. in a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{ instant melt down.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{chernobyl will look like a campfire.}
<A>__{young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. bond decides to try rattling harmsway so he can move closer to the gun, unnoticed.}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{we're through the first gate. approaching the second }
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(demanding)}
<D>__{why, harmsway? wasn't stealing the gold enough?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(to yung)}
<D>__{bore through.}
<P>__{(to bond, chuckling)}
<D>__{...they used to say living well was the best revenge, mr. bond.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're wrong.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{revenge is the best revenge.}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{entering the main tunnel ten minutes to target }
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{what could you possibly have to be vengeful for, harmsway? still trying to prove yourself to daddy?}
<A>__{this infuriates harmsway. bond moves closer to the gun.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{hong kong, mr. bond!}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{you have to leave }
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(enraged, ignoring yung)}
<D>__{a hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island a barren, lifeless rock and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and now that i'm being forced to give it back, i intend to return it in exactly the same condition: a barren, lifeless rock.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the gold is merely reparations payment from the spineless british government who wouldn't listen.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(to sidney, glancing at the gun)}
<D>__{... i think uncle elliot is having his own melt down.}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{approaching the third gate }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{smash through it!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{laugh all you'd like, mr. bond but you fit perfectly in to my plans.}
<P>__{(he reaches for a newspaper)}
<D>__{here. this just in. newsflash. read all about it.}
<A>__{he thrusts an issue of tomorrow at bond, holding the top half out as bond reads the headlines, sourly:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{... hong kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown... british agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; harmsway calls for british government to resign.}
<A>__{harmsway smiles at bond:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...as the advertising says: tomorrow never lies.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{what about the gold?}
<C>__{yung}
<D>__{you must go. now. otherwise the boat won't be out of range }
<A>__{stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{thirty seconds.}
<P>__{(then, to bond)}
<D>__{that's the most brilliant part of the plan, mr. bond: to save the economy, i will let the new british government my british government announce that the gold was irradiated in hong kong where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and just by coincidence:}
<A>__{he turns the paper over and reads reveals a smaller headline:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...gold mine opens in vietnam.}
<P>__{(turns to stamper)}
<D>__{let's go. put them in the airlock.}
<A>__{stamper moves towards bond and sidney. bond edges closer to the gun.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you'll never get away with it, harmsway. too many people know.}
<A>__{bond tenses, ready to spring }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{who, mr. bond? the kooks the crazies the conspiracy theorists? the oliver stones of the world?}
<P>__{(pausing, then, with great scorn:)}
<D>__{i will publish their books, i will make their movies, i will put them on my tv shows!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're my bellboys. they carry my luggage.}
<A>__{bond moves, but the guard picks up the gun!!! bond frowns.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{now. get them in the airlock.}
<A>__{fortunately, bond has a back up plan. as stamper hustles them off }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{one problem, harmsway: the girl. and the handcuffs. they'll give it away.}
<A>__{harmsway considers this for a second. sidney takes bond's arm.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no. i want to stay with him.}
<A>__{bond looks at her. he's surprised: in the blink of an eye, he realizes he's developed feelings for her. he knows that if he could hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "you're a hell of a girl"... but at the same instant throwing a glance at yung he knows he's running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(breaking the moment, cynically)}
<D>__{how sweet.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(satto, to bond)}
<D>__{my timing always was lousy.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(cold and hard)}
<D>__{i'd rather die alone.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{take the girl. leave the handcuffs. we'll drown her at sea.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to bond, sarcastically)}
<D>__{enjoy the rest of your life.}
<A>__{as stamper pushes bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{i will meet you on the boat, south of lantau island.}
