<L>__{interior mozart's apartment living room day 1780's}
<A>__{mozart comes out. framed in the doorway from outside stands lorl, the maid we noticed in salieri's house. from his bedroom leopold peeps out to watch. mozart goes to the girl. constanze follows.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{are you herr mozart?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{my name is lorl, sir. i'm a maidservant. i was asked to come here and offer my services to you.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{they'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what do you mean? what admirer?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{i can't tell you that, ma'am.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{yes. i can live in or out just as you wish.}
<A>__{mozart turns to his father.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{papa, is this your idea?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{mine?}
<A>__{the old man emerges from his bedroom. his son looks at him delightedly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{are you playing a trick on me?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i never saw this girl in my life.}
<P>__{(to lorl)}
<D>__{is this a kind of joke?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{not at all, sir. and i was told to wait for an answer.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{young woman, this won't do at all. my son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it.}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{but i really can't tell you, sir.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh, this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what is ridiculous? wolfi has many admirers in vienna. they love him here. people send us gifts all the time.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but you can't take her without reference. it's unheard of!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{well, this is none of your business.}
<P>__{(to lorl)}
<D>__{whoever sent you is going to pay, no?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{that's right, ma'am.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{so now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house?}
<A>__{constanze looks furiously at him, then at lorl.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{who is we? who is letting who?}
<P>__{(to lorl)}
<D>__{could you please wait outside?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{lorl goes outside and closes the door. constanze turns on leopold.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{look, old man, you stay out of this. we spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. and then you think you can }
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{stanzi!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{no, it's right he should hear. i'm sick to death of it. we can't do anything right for you, can we?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{never mind. you won't have to do anything for me ever again. i'm leaving!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{papa!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm not staying here to be a burden.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no one calls you that.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{she does. she says i sleep all day.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{and so you do! the only time you come out is to eat.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{and what do you expect? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh, now i'm a bad housekeeper!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{so you are! the place is a pigsty all the time.}
<C>__{constanze}
<P>__{(to mozart)}
<D>__{do you hear him? do you?}
<A>__{explosively she opens the door.}
<C>__{constanze}
<P>__{(to lorl)}
<D>__{when can you start?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{right away, ma'am.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{good! come in. you'll start with that room there.}
<P>__{(indicating leopold's room)}
<D>__{it's filthy!}
<A>__{she leads the maid into leopold's room. mozart steals back into his workroom and gently closes the door. leopold is left alone.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{sorry, sorry! i'm sorry i spoke! i'm just a provincial from salzburg. what do i know about smart vienna? parties all night, every night. dancing and drinking like idiot children!}
