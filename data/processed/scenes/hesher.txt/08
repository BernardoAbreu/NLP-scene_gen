<L>__{exterior housing development moments later}
<A>__{tj rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development half built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets. up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road a big patch of dirt and rocks. he veers up a driveway to avoid it. he passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. he hits the road and loses his balance. the handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road. he jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. he looks at it. it's badly grazed. he yelps again, angry. he picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. he hurls the rock through its front window. glass crashes down. a silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late 20s, long greasy haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. he has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. this is hesher. he makes a determined line toward tj.}
