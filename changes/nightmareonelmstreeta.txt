<DIAL>__{-- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash- dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal. Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten, reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL. -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight razor, until its fingertips are off. -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp. -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal being assembled with crude tools, into some sort of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus, against a background light of FIRE, and a deep rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY. -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove. -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it. -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like apparatus, filling it out and transforming it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing it to shreds.}

Her steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves free. A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC. Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and on into the dark.  No reason why it's there. Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.}

<ACTION>__{Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN. Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC. Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas, approaching TINA. CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh. They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND. TINA rushes away, hands over her ears. ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and everything goes silent. CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress, leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.}

And it's his fingers that are tipped with the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.

<DIAL>__{And now you die...}
<ACTION>__{There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons. NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the end of her long, long tunnel.  And the way she says the words, they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.}
<CHAR>__{NANCY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's too late, Krueger.  I know the secret now -- this is just a dream, too -- you're not alive -- the whole thing is a dream -- so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(even, firm)}
<DIAL>__{I take back every bit of energy I ever gave you. You're nothing.  You're shit.}
<ACTION>__{And then she turns her back on him.  KRUEGER bunches his fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and raises his hand over the back of her head and neck. NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door. CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob. CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised. MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his balance and falling down, down, down...  And he's gone.}

<DIAL>__{See ya.}
<ACTION>__{WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.  The whole scene is wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.  We notice that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.  Then we see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.  TINA and ROD are in the back seat.  They all wave to MARGE as NANCY climbs in.}

<ACTION>__{ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.  GLEN slips into the seat next to NANCY.  Someone else is driving, it seems.  NANCY looks up to the DRIVER.  The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible, scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin! ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast and hard as a beartrap!  NANCY'S frightened face flies to the window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away from the curb and into the thick fog. CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog, jumping rope and singing gayly.}
