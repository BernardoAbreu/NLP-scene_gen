<D>__{all i'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't be the same rate. travel time is down time, right? i mean, we're not even in the same car as the client.}
<P>__{(to avery)}
<D>__{you told me the job was at the house. when we get to it. well, are we shadowing the client right now or are we just going the same way? the company i was with in seattle, these distinctions were made. now, i don't dispute him getting the full whack.}
<P>__{(he means rick, who's older)}
<D>__{seniority and all that. but if i'm getting paid the same hourly rate when we're at the house as i am in this car, that doesn't sit well with me and i feel obliged to say so. 'cause in seattle what you're paying now for so called travel time was half what we got for actual clock time with the client. so i just feel we should get more when the job actually commences .}
