<L>__{interior taxi afternoon}
<A>__{wills looks out the window, his arm draped around charlotte who lies nestled against him, eyes closed. he suddenly sees something. he thinks. checks his watch. his eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{driver! quick! pull over here! right here!}
<A>__{charlotte, a little sleepy, comes to. she looks out the window and her face softens with happiness.}
<L>__{exterior the brick church, 92nd and park same}
<A>__{on the steps of the old church a choir sings christmas carols. all around them, a large crowd sings along. wills and charlotte get out of the cab. his arm around her, wills pulls her into the crowd. they join the carol. wills sings well. charlotte is tone deaf. in between lines of the song, she calls out }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i didn't know you could sing!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i didn't know you couldn't!}
<A>__{she laughs and continues to sing. the carols ends to cheers and applause. the choirmaster steps forward to a microphone }
<C>__{choirmaster}
<D>__{well, you all know what time it is!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(confused to wills)}
<D>__{no, i don't. do you?}
<A>__{he grins. the choirmaster nods at someone in the distance. then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count down. the crowd joins in }
<C>__{choirmaster and crowd}
<D>__{ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!}
<A>__{at that instant, all the white christmas lights on the trees of the median from 96th street to 44th street pop on simultaneously an enchanted fairy tale spectacle. the crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns. charlotte's eyes are filled with happy wonder.}
<C>__{choirmaster}
<D>__{happy holidays!}
<A>__{as another carol begins, wills wraps his arms around charlotte and kisses her. he pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes, and whispers with passionate sincerity }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i love you, charlotte.}
<A>__{for an instant, her eyes flare as though she were surprised. then her eyes fill with tears. she tries to speak but she is choked by a sob. she buries her face in his chest and cries. wills smiles with warm, almost paternal, indulgence. he strokes her hair. she hugs him as though she'll never let go.}
