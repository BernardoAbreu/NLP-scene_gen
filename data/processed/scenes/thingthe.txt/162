<A>__{macready holds the flashlight for palmer. their breath, puffs of white smoke.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{somebody definitely messed with it.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we going to make it?}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{hope so. another ten, fifteen minutes. what i don't get is...}
<A>__{the sound of a screeching. from somewhere in the compound. the two men's faces, locked in fear.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{the generator has been repaired; the lights within the compound are back on. grim and tense. everyone is present but fuchs. eyes flit from man to man. palmer, nauls and sanchez are spread out about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from the rest. norris and childs are tying the doctor, clark and garry to the couch. macready prepares several makeshift blowtorches as he kneels on the ground.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{where were the flashlights?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{screw the flashlights. where the hell were you?}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{tons of stuff's been missing around here. magnetos, cables, wire...}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{kitchen things, too...}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{anybody see fuchs... or hear him...? huh?}
<A>__{no answer as the men's faces roam the room. childs glares at garry as he begins to tie him in.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{where'd you go?}
<A>__{garry's groggy features stare blankly.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{i said where? where'd you go?!}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{was dark... find a light...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{you lying bastard...}
<A>__{garry struggles to his feet, affronted.}
<C>__{garry}
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{i rather don't like your tone...}
<A>__{he grabs childs by the collar.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{you sit back down...}
<A>__{childs whales on him with a right hand. both go tumbling over the couch. macready and norris dive in breaking it up.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{enough...}
<A>__{macready, furious, pulls childs away. norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his chest. the strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. macready glances up. he and childs release each other.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{that storm's going to start ripping any minute so we don't have much time.}
<A>__{he thrusts one of the blowtorches hard into childs' stomach.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we've got to find fuchs. when we find him we kill him.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{if he's one of those things, we've got to get to him before he changes... nauls, you and childs and i will check the outside shacks...}
<A>__{he tosses torches to sanchez and palmer.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{sanchez, you and palmer search the inside...}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{i ain't going with sanchez.}
<A>__{sanchez snaps his head toward palmer. palmer looks at the others.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{i ain't going with him. i will go with childs...}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{well, screw you, man!}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{i ain't going with you!}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{well, who says i want you going with me?!}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{cut the bullshit... okay, sanchez, you come with us. norris... you stay here...}
<P>__{(refers to tied up men)}
<D>__{any of them move you fry 'em. and if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and everybody watch whoever you're with. real close.}
<A>__{the men survey each other.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{let's move.}
