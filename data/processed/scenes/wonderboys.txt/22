<L>__{interior auditorium later}
<A>__{on the stage. walter gaskell stands alone at a podium.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{...really needs no introduction. walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you. you all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call.. .q.}
<A>__{as the audience thunders, grady and james slink into the auditorium. it's standing room only. as they head for an open space against the back wail, grady squeezes past a kid with a goatee .who regards him warily.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{grady stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush. finally, he speaks again.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{i am a writer.}
<A>__{as the audience explodes with glee, grady frowns. he glances to his right, sees james' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement.}
<C>__{q }
<D>__{as a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie." presumably, each of you has}
<P>__{an idea. (gestures to the audience)}
<D>__{but, how do you go from there to here? how do you go from having an idea to having a book? how do you get across? what is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? faith. faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you...}
<A>__{grady glances at james, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, sara standing by the far exit. a blink later, she is gone.}
<C>__{q }
<D>__{...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell.}
<A>__{grady leans back, listening to the beating of his own heart, the soft glimmer of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head... abruptly, james laughs out loud some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. as q looks and four hundred other heads turn, james ducks down mortified. crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies james with amusement, then winks at grady. grady blinks, turns to james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
