<A>__{kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm. he is awake but pale, still weak. he studies his visitors.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you... i've seen you around the base. but you...}
<P>__{(pointing to hardy)}

<D>__{coast guard, special detective detail. we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk.}
<A>__{kendall's laugh turns into a cough. placing hardy.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{that's it. you're that policeman with friends in low places. tell me, how's guissepe torres doing these days? those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer }

<D>__{levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. i suggest you talk to us.}
<A>__{kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.}
<C>__{kendall}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you're working too hard, levi. i can tell cause you're sweating. and you're sweating cause you have no idea what dunbar's already told us.}
