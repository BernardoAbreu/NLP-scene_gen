<L>__{interior the garage moments later.}
<A>__{martin stands in the garage with garson, going over what happened.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{so after dinner and the movie, we came home at around 11:30 and found her in the garage. i turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{what about trying to revive your wife?}
<A>__{martin seems a bit taken aback by the question.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{of course, we did that too, but i couldn't feel a pulse. mini took a course at school in cpr and tried that, but...}
<P>__{(taking a breath)}
<D>__{it didn't work.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{so your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{may i ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we never thought she'd do anything like...this. after the episode in the mall, diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and i just needed a break. it's been a very stressful time.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{of course. so this was your wife's car?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{was it in the garage when you left?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(a little flustered)}
<D>__{is, is that important?}
<C>__{g}
<C>__{arson}
<D>__{just trying to reconstruct what happened.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{and no one drove it during those three days?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no, mini and i have our own cars.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{we are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{crime lab? oh, okay.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{again, purely routine.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{have you found a note yet?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<A>__{garson's eyes flicker for a split second.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{a suicide note? the deceased usually leaves one.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{oh...right, no...not yet. but we haven't really looked.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{mind if i take a look around?}
<A>__{martin hesitates for just a split second.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no...of course not.}
