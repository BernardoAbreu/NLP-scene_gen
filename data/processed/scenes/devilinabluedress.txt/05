<L>__{interior joppy's bar}
<A>__{t bone walker's "westside baby" plays on the jukebox as easy takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out. the front page of the los angeles times lies face up on the table beneath the ashtray displaying a photograph of a middle aged white man and his pretty young woman companion smiling and waving. above the happy couple is a headline "carter drops out of race"... the caption under the photo reads "wealthy civic leader, todd carter, shown here with his lovely bride to be, daphne monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for comment on his surprising withdrawal from the mayor's race."}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{catch ya later, joppy.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{splack! an older black man hitching up his pants underneath a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer glass down hard on the counter on his way out.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{hey, watch the marble! dammit, what'd i tell you?}
<A>__{the fifty year old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag. behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "fuller vs. shag. 10 round main event." we could make out more of the poster and the eight by ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{joppy, how much they payin' out there at mcdonell douglas?}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{i don't know. don't it say }
<A>__{his words hang as his eyes stray toward the door. easy looks up also at the doorway which fills with the large frame of the white man in an off white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room. satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at joppy and walks to the far end of the bar. easy is surprised to see joppy, tough ex heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons. the white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private. easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks. after a moment...}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{easy, come on over here. this here's somebody i want ya to meet... come on. this here's a friend of mine.}
<A>__{easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{yeah, easy. this here's mr. albright.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{you can call me dewitt, easy.}
<A>__{he extends his hand and easy shakes it.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<C>__{joppy}
<P>__{(bowing and grinning)}
<D>__{mr. albright and me goes back to before the war when i was still in the fight game.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(to easy)}
<D>__{ever seen this guy fight...? any time joppy shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock down drag out fisticuffs... where you from, easy?}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{houston.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{houston... joppy's hometown.}
<A>__{joppy pours albright a straight shot of wild turkey and the big man sips it.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{so i hear you need a job.}
<A>__{easy throws a look at joppy, but joppy is busy buffing the bar and putting more of easy's business in the street.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{aw yeah, easy always tryin' to do better. got his high school certificate from night school. he's threatenin' up on some college. and he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house. shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{property owner, hunh?}
<A>__{he turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the counter.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{these big companies, don't give a damn, do they?}
<A>__{he reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card and scribbles something on it.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{if you need a job, drop by this address at seven tonight.}
<A>__{easy takes the card and glances at it.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what kind of work you do?}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i do favors... i do favors for friends. drop by.}
<A>__{he nods to joppy and walks out the door.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{who the hell is that, joppy?}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{just somebody i know... a bidness man.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what kinda business?}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{oh, i don't ask him all that. he comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him... he pays good.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{in other words, he's a gangster.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{i didn't say that... but if there's a dollar laying in the street i don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. if you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. all them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house.}
<A>__{easy cocks his head "are you crazy?"}
<C>__{joppy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody... he'll pay you whether you see anything or not... if it was me i'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... ain't nothin' to worry about.}
<A>__{easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{when somebody tells me "don't worry," i usually look down to see if my fly is open... i noticed albright didn't bother to pay for his drink.}
