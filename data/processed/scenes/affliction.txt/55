<A>__{gordon and wade drive up the same road jack took twombley. wade fiddles with the cb. no use: static.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{fuck. turn it off.}
<P>__{(wade does)}
<D>__{all you heard was there was some kinda accident?}
<C>__{wade}

<A>__{lariviere grunts disapproval as wade slips the butt out his window.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. that's what usually happens.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{i shoulda sent you instead of jack.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i wish you had. i'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{you ain't the hunter jack is. and he can't drive the grader worth shit.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{like hell.}
