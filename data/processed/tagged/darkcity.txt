<D>__{november 29th, 1992}
<B>__{darkness}
<A>__{a low rumble increases in volume.}
<T>__{fade up:}
<A>__{a black gloved hand wraps around a bulky electrical lever, thrusts forward. snap! electricity arcs through darkness. o.s. sound of machinery turning on.}
<B>__{titles over}
<A>__{montage of clocks starting various. second hands turn ticking gets louder.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{shadows dance. a bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing: clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor... sleeping eyes in and out of darkness. the eyes open. confusion. widen angle on jonathan white a man in his early thirties, dark featured. he sits up. water splashes. he's in a tub of long cold water. his neck aches like he's been sleeping forever. he looks down into the murky water around him. a feint movement beneath the surface, something swimming a small dark shape. startled, he leaps from the bath. angle the swinging light bulb. the man's hand reaches up, stops the light bulb mid swing. he steps to a circular window. the glass is cracked, covered in grime. he wipes it, this only smears the dirt. it's dark out there.}
<L>__{exterior building night}
<A>__{angle on white from outside the window, through blurry glass. a rapid flying p.o.v. pulls back in silence. the window is a speck on the side of a vast grey tower.}
<B>__{back in the bathroom}
<A>__{white shivers, cold. he stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor. he looks at his feet and legs, covered with numerous small bites. he dries the bloody wounds with a towel. he picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on. loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with holes in both soles. in his trouser pocket he finds a key a room number on a plastic tag. he hears splashing in the bath tub. he steps over, looks into the murky water. suddenly a small silver fish leaps from the water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about. he leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the water. like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the shadows. he hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob. he leans down.}
<B>__{tight on his eye}
<A>__{blinking through the key hole. p.o.v. of an empty room a glimpse of motion the door across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.}
<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{white pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room. no sign of life. cheap decorations. he walks around cautiously. turns lights on. then reconsiders. turns them off again. disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror. angle on open bathroom door the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor. white steps back into the bathroom. he picks up the fish again, doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.}
<B>__{back in the other room}
<A>__{he searches through things. a grey overcoat in the closet. he goes through the pockets, finds a wallet. no i.d., just a laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea side town. angle on a revolver on the bed side table. he picks it up, his grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the trigger and... bang! the gun goes off. a bullet ricochets wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall. startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again. he examines it carefully now. opens the chamber. tight on the gun five bullets left. he turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat. he moves to the bed. a ripped photograph on the rug. a fragment of a woman's face, her left eye. he lifts the fragment up. there's handwriting on the back, part of a note:}
<D>__{...means the most to me. love you forever. e...}
<A>__{the rest is missing. he sits on the edge of the bed. as he does this, he notices something else on the floor. his p.o.v. follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a woman's bare foot behind the bed. he stands abruptly, fumbles across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room. in the shadows he can make out a woman's naked body lying in a pool of blood. her eyes stare lifeless. white stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his mouth.}
<L>__{interior hotel corridor night}
<A>__{white stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support. lights flicker. at the end of the corridor, elevator doors open. light and musak flood out.}
<L>__{interior lobby night}
<A>__{white staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front desk. a voice from the back room:}
<C>__{hotel manager o.s.}
<D>__{hey, you! you gotta message.}
<A>__{white stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{message in d'box! you deaf?}
<A>__{white sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him. reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain into the manager's office. television sounds o.s.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{hard to see the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of the t.v. set. white grabs the note, looks at it. a phone number, also his room number, and what appears to be his name: jonathan white. that's all. white thrusts the message in his pocket.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{got my money?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what? i... how long have i been here?}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{jeez, too damn long if you ask me! what about the two weeks y'owe me...}
<A>__{totally confused, white turns to leave, sees something. stops. his p.o.v. a painting on a wall (cheap print variety) waves on a beach. a breeze rustles the pages of a calender, pinned beside the picture. tight on white move in on his ear. o.s. sound surf crashes on shore. a woman's voice whispers:}
<C>__{voice o.s.}
<D>__{what is your name... what is your name...}
<A>__{he backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic sees a sign: toilets. a painted hand points the way.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i will be back later.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{yeah. well, y'better be.}
<A>__{camera reveals a figure watching from a shadowy corner of the lobby. as white runs out, the mystery man picks up a pay phone, dials. whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.}
<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{white pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor. pipes steam and drip water. he rounds a corner, slips, nearly falls.}
<L>__{interior men's room night}
<A>__{puddles on the floor, stains on the walls. white bursts through the door and into a cubicle. he bends over a toilet bowl and vomits.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{he looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve. a breeze tugs at his stringy hair. a tiny ventilation grill above the cistern looks out at the street. his p.o.v. outside sheets of newspaper blow past. a full moon, surrounded by blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.}
<L>__{interior cinema night}
<A>__{a watch on a hairy wrist. seconds tick past. soft flickering light. voices o.s. angle on frank bumstead police inspector. he looks down at the watch. time to leave. he stands, heads for an illuminated exit sign. images flicker on a screen. the inspector rushes to the door, runs into an usher, who gasps.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{gesundheit!}
<A>__{bumstead quickly moves off.}
<L>__{interior cinema lobby}
<A>__{the inspector makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil, scribbles in a notebook. behind thick glass, he argues soundlessly into a phone. big in foreground a popcorn machine rattles noisily.}
<B>__{inside the booth}
<A>__{the inspector is upset, face strained. a male voice chatters quickly through the receiver.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{...but you told me the meeting was ten thirty .}
<A>__{a burst of chatter.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{i know, sir, but i can't make it at nine thirty ... it's um well, inconvenient...}
<A>__{a stream of chatter stops him.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{yes, sir... i understand... yes... but, i've done fine so far without an assistant...}
<A>__{the inspector tries to interject as the voice cuts in again...}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{but... but i... i...}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{nine thirty. yes.}
<L>__{interior men's room}
<A>__{we are underwater. white's face swims into view. bubbles spew from the mouth, the eyes stare in horror. angle on men's room white washes his face in a sink. he looks up, wipes his face dry with his coat. he turns towards the door to leave. there are two identical. he cannot remember which he came through. takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness. he realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but the door clicks behind him: locked.}
<L>__{interior concrete tunnel}
<A>__{pitch black. trickling water. a distant voice over a p.a. system recites names, followed by numbers. a light, far away. white walks towards it. he steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a blank wall. he pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the slot, dials the number on his message. ringing no answer. suddenly white feels cold.}
<C>__{voice o.s.}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{startled, white drops the phone and turns. a figure moves forward out of darkness: angle on the mystery man from the hotel lobby. the stranger wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale skin. he is completely bald. he studies white carefully. white glances about nervously walks back up the corridor, his eyes pinned to the man.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{you are lost, yes?}
<A>__{white retreats faster. a flash of steel a dagger appears by the stranger's side, gripped in a black leather glove. he moves forward, a grin on his pale face. white stops, backs against the wall.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{co operate. do not make this difficult.}
<A>__{white panics he's cornered. he remembers the revolver. he pulls it from his coat and levels it at the stranger, his hand shakes terribly. on the stranger continuing to advance. something about his eyes makes white immobile, unable to think clearly.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{you will not shoot, yes. there is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness...}
<A>__{the gun fires again and again. red splashes appear on the man. his shoulder. his leg. his neck. he walks forward, with spastic jerks as bullets rip into him. a final shot point blank into the stranger's forehead. a stream of black liquid spouts from the hole. blue smoke clears. the man stands motionless, his mouth hangs open. then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.}
<L>__{interior morgue night}
<A>__{clicking of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles. inspector bumstead strides down a silent corridor. he reaches into his pocket, removes a surgical mask, places it over his nose and mouth.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor. the man, who is dressed identically to the inspector, is his superior: chief inspector stromboli.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{good evening, sir.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{yes. this way.}
<A>__{stromboli leads the inspector into a tiled room containing several covered bodies. the two men are greeted by a cheerful looking mortician.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{welcome, gentlemen. youire early. here for the examination, right?}
<A>__{stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the row of corpses. bumstead follows.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{the handiwork of an extremely sick individual.}
<A>__{he throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{youive read the reports. not much to go on. we know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... always the same type of blade. forensics match in each case... anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.}
<A>__{stromboli shakes his head, turns away from the final body, looks at the inspector.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{why are you wearing that thing on your face?}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{germs, sir. these places are full of them.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{one thingis for sure, heis ambitious. youill be a busy man from now on.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{you can say that again.}
<A>__{stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man. the mortician becomes serious and goes back to his work.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{what about thompson, sir? wasnit this his case?}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. anyway he isnit with us any longer. the case is yours. go through his files. take what you need.}
<P>__{(less business like)}
<D>__{by the way, howis your mother?}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{sheis getting better, thanks. she...}
<C>__{stromboli }
<D>__{very good...}
<A>__{the chief inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{letis go, bumstead. so much to do and so little time.}
<L>__{exterior building night}
<A>__{a large faded billboard advertisement on a building facade. a portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "lump o" a cereal box carton. the camera moves in steadily, rises upwards, closer on the womanis face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her}
<B>__{painted iris.}
<L>__{interior stair well}
<A>__{a raftered room on the other side of the billboard. camera tilts to a convoluted staircase at the base, the shadow of a man runs. feet pace rapidly. tilt up to reveal white. camera follows as he tries to lose himself from possible pursuers. he steps through a low archway into a back alley, rounds a corner. a dead end. white stops, looks around, then up. heis breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath. he starts to shake. above, the walls stretch into darkness. an opening way up there he can see stars. something dark crosses the gap of sky. a rushing noise in the distance. wind starts to pick up. trash is being kicked up. a sheet of newspaper wraps around whiteis leg. he tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonit come off. he bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but something grabs his eye. he stares at the page for a moment then his legs slip from under him and he falls to the ground. he holds his head like itis going to explode. a whimper deep in his throat. his body is trembling violently. push in tight on the paper on the ground. a front page headline: man hunt continues for serial killer! white looks up terrified. the rushing noise o.s. again.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{on the wall facing him, a door has appeared where moments before there was nothing. the door creaks open to reveal another door within. this one extends outwards on the end of a lengthening wooden shaft. white, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket. tries to side step the advancing door but itis too late, he can only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the wall.}
<L>__{interior hotel lobby night}
<A>__{hand held p.o.v. through the swaying beads hanging in the back room doorway. two figures peer into the room.}
<C>__{figure 1}
<D>__{we are looking for jonathan white.}
<A>__{the hotel manager looks up, moves forward into light: a squat, hunch backed man with glasses. he steps through the beads, glares at the intruders.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{what for?}
<A>__{on the men an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to kill white. black coats, glasses, pale skin. creepy. a black gloved hand flashes forward, grips the manageris face and doesnit let go. the manager struggles, gulps for air. heis pushed back heavily against the wall.}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{which room is he in?}
<A>__{the leather glove squeezes, blood trickles from the manageris ears, through the fingers.}
<L>__{interior room 43}
<A>__{another (very short) figure is searching the room. he hears noises o.s. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against the wall. on the man fredrick a stunted body, an oversized head, thick limbs. the rest of his features lost in shadow. the door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room. on the two mystery men as they step in and look around. they search the room, knock stuff over. one of the men kicks at the womanis corpse in the corner. behind him, fredrick, still hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.}
<L>__{exterior flying p.o.v. night}
<A>__{a flying perspective past buildings. an insect like buzzing o.s. way down below, in a canyon of silent buildings, a lone figure walks.}
<L>__{exterior down on the street}
<A>__{a breeze pulls at whiteis hair and coat. he takes out the wallet a few dollars.}
<B>__{his p.o.v. as he walks}
<A>__{the city is dead. empty. desolate. buildings hang down out of black. day time was never invented. as he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a business card he hadnit noticed, flutters to the ground. he stops, picks it up. in simple print: doctor d.p. schreber m.d., a phone number. scribbled handwriting on the back says: thursday 0930. on white he glances across the street. his p.o.v. a cafe. a broken neon fish buzzes above the doorway.}
<L>__{interior chinese cafe}
<A>__{he walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six tables. empty. dirty. he sits and waits. a clock ticks on the wall midnight. white coughs, for attention. a noise from a doorway. a shadow moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks. a small asian woman appears and limps to his table. she speaks very quickly in chinese. he does not understand. she points to a chalk board on the wall a list of dishes also in chinese, only one in english the last one. at the bottom. in small printerior "noodles".}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{the noodles. iill have some noodles.}
<A>__{the old woman rips a yellow ticket from a pad, gives it to white. a number on it. she points her crooked finger again at a speaker box above a small serving window in the wall. a greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{we call.}
<A>__{she leaves again. white looks about the empty room. insects are zapped on an illuminated device hanging on the wall. an old air conditioner rattles noisily. noises from the kitchen voices argue in chinese, a baby cries. then silence. white removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table. he overcomes his fear, starts to read the article. leans forward, hands trembling. without realising, he holds the paper over a candle burning on the table. the paper catches fire, is engulfed. he drops the flaming page on the table. now the table cloth starts to burn. white is frantic. on a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water, and dumps this on the flames. it kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table cloth. the paper is ash. he moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the smoke away.}
<L>__{interior police station night}
<A>__{bumstead is moving quickly. he suddenly trips and falls to the floor. he curses under his breath, then looks up.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a door thompson: detective inspector on the frosted glass. bumstead stands, pushes into the office.}
<B>__{inside}

<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{a real shame...}
<A>__{he starts to look around. tight on filing cabinet a drawer is pulled open. thompsonis files are also a mess. bumstead continues to shake his head. he reaches for a file. a loud snap!}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{yaaaaaaaaah!}
<A>__{he recoils. a mousetrap has snapped over his fingers. he pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.}
<L>__{interior chinese cafe}
<A>__{white is still waiting for his food. he leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites worse, inflamed. he uses a napkin to wipe at the pus. aerial perspective of a fly circling the room, looking down on white. on the fly it lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table. the creature is some kind of surveillance device half insect half machine. itis spying on him. move in tight as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head. it shits on the food behind it. white is oblivious to this. heis finished examining his leg, is sitting quietly. he yawns. his head nods forward briefly. a noise. white looks up. a trap door has opened in the ceiling. two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole. a sea breeze blows through the room. the sound of surf, seagulls crying. on whiteis nose twitching. he can smell the ocean. the wallpaper comes alive like a seething tangle of worms. one by one, three men in black coats lower into the room, floating on air. they pull out knifes, step forward. on white rigid with terror. on the men though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom, they too resemble the man who confronted white earlier. they walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads. ready to attack. they lean over him, pause dramatically.}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{donit fall asleep.}
<P>__{(chuckles softly)}
<D>__{might never wake, yes.}
<A>__{this man turns to the others. they all smile, then turn back to white.}

<A>__{another voice has been speaking softly now it is louder. repeating:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{fifty six... fifty six...}
<A>__{angle a chair falls to the floor. white leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented. just a dream he had dozed. widen angle the place is still empty. white glances to the serving window. a dish waits for him, framed in the glowing fluoro square. he gets it. a bowl of soupy liquid with noodles. he sits down. he is about to start eating realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon. picking up the bowl again, he heads to the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{he takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds himself in another corridor. he looks about, unsure which direction to go in.}
<L>__{interior series of rooms later}
<A>__{white is lost, still holding the soup. he moves through a number of rusted metal doors that open and shut automatically. each reveals another room or corridor. deserted spaces long forgotten dusty, crumbling. he feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and looks at it. white holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup in the other. disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<B>__{a ticking sound o.s.}
<A>__{white stops. looks up. a large clock suspended from the rafters. a tug at his coat. standing beside him is fredrick the little man from whiteis hotel room.}

<C>__{frerick}
<D>__{shit!}
<P>__{(looks at white)}
<D>__{quick! run!}
<A>__{both men run like crazy, white awkwardly holding the bowl of soup. they come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor. fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time. white climbs into frame, looks around, finds another corridor. the little man is nowhere to be seen. white reaches another junction several corridors branch off.}

<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{great.}
<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{a small room with arched windows that look over the city. fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned table. he scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then puts it into a metal cylinder he finds beneath the table also. he glances out a window, notices a figure standing beneath a street lamp below, looking up at him. startled, fredrick darts back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical pipes running up into the ceiling. tight on one of the pipes he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it. the cylinder is snatched from his hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief. a shadow falls across his back. he turns. he screams.}
<L>__{interior exterior various}
<A>__{tight rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding speed. the cylinder races around corners. it clanks and grinds. hurtles up the side of a building. then plummets underground. rushes through darkness.}
<L>__{exterior bridge night}
<A>__{the camera moves along a bridge like structure. an enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons. under the bridge, pipes spew sewage into stagnant water. angle on white walking seen through a series of illuminated, dirty, windows. he occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{tight on the fish swimming weakly in the soup. angle on white he stops, looks up at o.s. sound of clattering metal. a pipe runs the length of the corridor the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness. then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of screams somewhere in the building. white hurriedly moves towards the source.}
<B>__{another corridor}
<A>__{white rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular hole in a wall. another scream, weaker now he runs to the hole in the wall and looks through.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a small, very ordered room. a fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. white cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole. he can see into an adjoining room to his right two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson. the man looks up itis fredrick just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers. he doesnit scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. suddenly a sliding door slams onto the back of whiteis neck, traps his head in the hole. he struggles, tries to free himself. drops the bowl of soup. it shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. inside the bathroom the killers look up at the smashing noise. back in the corridor white pulls with all his strength. the door gives and he stumbles backwards. he is about to run away but glances at the floor. the fish is flapping about still alive.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{white darts from a doorway, trips and falls. he sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps. he looks at a building towering above him. chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:}

<A>__{bumstead moves off.}
<L>__{interior library}
<A>__{white steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign saying, silence in formal letters. the place seems abandoned, then he notices a hint of movement. cigarette smoke snakes into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor. he walks up to an elderly female librarian sitting behind a desk, smoking, reading. white looks somewhat distraught still.}

<D>__{what do you want? tell me!}
<A>__{the men stop. so does white. they separate, now approaching him from opposite sides, moving around the bells. white doesnit know who to point the gun at he swings back and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the men approach. he lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right, thrusts the gun to one manis forehead. fires. the man steps back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing, falls into the shaft at the centre of the tower. the second man swings his dagger at white. white falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily. the man advances, smiling kicks the gun across the wooden floor. white, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on a loose floorboard. the board flies up, pivoting against whiteis heel, catches the mystery man with a crack under the chin. white runs at the off balance man, head butts him in the stomach. the man recoils, canit stop, steps off backwards into space, plummets into darkness towards the street below. white relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun. looks down at the floor. broken glass and capsules everywhere he dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle. starts to pick them up. behind him something is rising. the shadowy mystery man is levitating himself back up to the bell tower. he lands behind white, approaches, lifting his dagger, closer and closer. white glances around. the man lunges, pushing white towards the shaft beneath the swinging bells. white falls, dangles over dark space, the man stands above him.}

<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{the pipe leads to the outside of the building nowhere to go except a hundred stories straight down. he screams, almost falls. turns to start crawling back. suddenly the end of the pipe fills with whirring metal blades. the puppet has followed him in and is advancing. no choice he looks out the hole. sees a pipe on the outside of the building, running vertically near the opening. it looks impossible but it's his only chance. he climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening, reaches for the pipe. the puppet is almost upon him. he swings across, gets a hand on the pipe. he slips, dangles holding on one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole. the pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it. suddenly he hears a mechanical clicking turns to see the puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand. a soft noise reverberates in its voice box a mechanical giggle? a circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves down onto white's hand. tight on his eyes sweat beads and runs down his forehead. tight on the blade as it cuts into flesh. blood spatters white's face as he grimaces with intense pain. he can't hold on. he falls, plummets through space. screaming.}

<A>__{suddenly the papers on the bench in front of mister black burst}
<L>__{into flames. mister black recoils, almost falling off his}
<A>__{chair, taken by surprise. the mystery men all look at white, a murmur of concern. mister black looks up at white angered.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{how dare you use your tricks on me!}
<A>__{white, genuinely surprised, looks around. several mystery men back away from him, scared.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{i didn't realise...}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{shut up, freak! monster! you are insignificant.}
<A>__{he glares across the room, angrily. an wooden chair in a corner starts to vibrate. close on mister black's eyes. the chair rises into the air hurls across the room at white. mister black laughs as it crashes into the wall. white ducks just in time. the gathered mystery men erupt into enthusiastic applause. white regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own. he lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near mister black, making him dance back and forth comically. this display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a waltz playing on a floating gramophone white has also activated with his mind. several mystery men are terrified. white is amazed at his own performance.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{you'll regret that.}
<A>__{mister black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his mouth.}
<C>__{mister black }
<D>__{shut it down!}
<A>__{a mystery man by the window, picks up a phone and dials furiously. everyone in the room remains silent waiting.}
<C>__{man on phone}
<D>__{yes, we have a problem here. shut it down immediately.}
<A>__{white doesn't understand what is going on. o.s. the sound of machinery winding down. angle on a clock hanging on the wall. on the second hand. it suddenly stops. all eyes are on mister black.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{this has all gone too far. yes, much too far.}
<A>__{mister black starts to shake. his eyes shut, clenches his teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to the floor. around the room walls crack, plaster rains down from the ceiling...}

<L>__{exterior city night}
<A>__{all over the city things start to fall apart a devastating impact on the landscape.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{a street cracks open. beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine like organs. these burst open with pus... a building vanishes... a car on a street corner flies into the air... a telephone box starts to spin, faster and taster, digging itself into the concrete. monstrous insect legs sprout from the hole left behind... geysers of steaming bile spurt into the night sky... black excrement forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone steps... the city is coming apart...}

<L>__{interior apartment h'}
<A>__{the room looks like an earthquake hit it broken furniture and gaping holes torn in the walls. several mystery men huddle behind an upturned table, watching white and mister black. they face each other, both still standing mental energies focused against each other in battle. the fighting is taken its toll on both men. a dagger hangs suspended in mid air, slowly rotating to face white with its shining silver blade. mister black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony fists by his side. pushing every ounce of mental power at the knife. white, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind against the knife. the blade starts to move, ever so slowly at first, towards white. his body is shaking with his mental effort. a bead of sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his vision. he is losing.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{we see an out of focus image. a group of dark figures. white regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table. from his perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he removes a syringe from white's forehead.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{good as new. yes. everything is easier now.}
<A>__{his vision clears, he can see. it's mister black. behind him a small crowd who turn out to be mystery men. mister black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask. underneath is a mess of pulsating organs and insect parts. this is what mystery men really look like. he laughs, starts to move rhythmically a strange dance step. the others join in, as they too pull off masks. each man reaches up to his left ear in unison. they pull squirming insects out, hold them up to the light. the insects scream triumphantly. white screams too. and he can't stop. everything goes black. then the sound of a key rattling in a lock. a door slowly creaks open...}
<L>__{interior seaside hotel room day}
<A>__{a p.o.v. enters a small room. dappled sunlight through a tattered lace curtain. a clock ticks on a wall. a cough o.s. from the corridor. a fat man, talks as he enters:}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{it's small but clean...}
<P>__{(it isn't)}
<D>__{...and the view's nice.}
<P>__{(points to window)}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<A>__{john white enters. he is haggard, eyes rimmed with red. he still holds the small black notebook, tight to his chest. he stands in the centre of the room, looks up. strangely, though the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories windows sit at various heights. white walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{a narrow street and at the end, the ocean. the sound of distant surf, he can taste the salt spray.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{the man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go, shutting the door. white puts the notebook down on a table near the open window.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{white has fallen asleep on the bed. he wakes, troubled. stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed. he moves like he is underwater. the sea breeze tugs at the curtain, draws him to the window.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings. two figures approach each other. he pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the woman, places it against the pillow on the bed. he sits on the edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs nothing out of the ordinary. white is disturbed by a tiny movement in his coat pocket. he reaches in and pulls out a small, emaciated fish. disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the creature. white raise his foot. his heel comes down with a sickening squish. the camera moves in steadily towards the notebook near the window. as the shot tightens we can read the title on the cover: answers by jonathan white, age nine. now a sudden gust of wind blows open the book. the pages flicker past. glimpses of happy things. a child's drawings of smiling people. the sun shining down on a blue ocean full of sailing boats. fields of colourful flowers. cute animals.}
<L>__{interior long corridor day}
<A>__{sound of surf, distant, muffled. camera moves slowly towards a door. the final door no others beyond this. echoic footsteps. tight on white his haggard face moves through darkness. he looks down at his walking feet. his p.o.v. white sees water, waves breaking, through the cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white hot, by the sun outside. on his hand as he reaches towards the handle. on his face as the door opens. a sharp line of light cuts across his features, as his eyes blink and water. the wind pulls at his messy hair. surf noise is louder now. reverse angle wider outside looking through the door, along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape. at the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of a woman with red hair. she looks out at the ocean, her back turned. angle looks back at white standing in the open doorway, squints into the sun. suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the first time. he steps out of frame briskly a weight gone from his shoulders. everything is clear finally, he knows exactly what to do. a voice recites names over a p.a. system.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{a tracking shot follows white, moves down the pier toward the woman. as white steps up to her, she turns and smiles.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{white nods slowly. he looks out of place in his crumpled suit. he stares out at the ocean. seagulls fly over. sun reflects off waves.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{he looks at her. smiles. then, slowly, brings his hands to her throat.}
