<A>__{the star man draws the satel compass out between his palms. the green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. he presses his palms together and looks past jenny at the rugged foothills. the first light of day is starting to color the sky behind them. jenny and the star man are startled by the drumming whomp of a helicopter. the star man looks out the window for its source. he can't see anything. the sound fades. in a moment, it is repeated on the other side of the car and again}

<A>__{jenny and the star man steady themselves for the last leg of their journey. suddenly, their silence is exploded by a cobra dropping out of the sky in front of them. its searchlight bangs into their faces and, with its thirty calibre machine guns blazing, it comes straight at them. jenny yanks the camaro onto the shoulder. the slugs chew up the asphalt beside it. she fishtails back onto the road. a second cobra surprises them from the star man's side. its machine gun knocks out the back window before he can fire. the star man crawls over his seat and arranges himself in the hole that was the back window to meet the cobras' next firing run. it doesn't take them long. the first two have been joined by a third. they swoop down on the camaro.}
