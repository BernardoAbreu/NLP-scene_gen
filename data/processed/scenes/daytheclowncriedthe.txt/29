<A>__{headquarters day we open on the shiny black boots swinging the door open in front of him and as we pull back we see helmut seated in a slumped position on the hard wood bench as we introduce the wearer of the black boots lt. reicher he enters his office as we go with him... (feather edge set)... he walks briskly to the desk where there are briefs and papers stacked high on his desk... he bellows, after looking at the top folder.}

<D>__{do i see what i think i see here?}
<A>__{the corporal leans over the desk, and in order to see puts his hand on the desk to brace himself... reicher smacks his arm, knocking his face flat on the desk... he stays there with his ass in the air, waiting for instructions. reicher leans down putting his nose right to the corporal's nose.}

<D>__{never put your hands on my desk... is that clear?}

<D>__{move it!!}
<A>__{the corporal rises and stands stiffer than ever...}
<C>__{reicher}
<P>__{(picking the folder up)}
<D>__{now tell me, is this brief correct? is that prisoner, the drunk, the one that impersonated the fuehrer?}
<C>__{corporal}
<D>__{yes sir! it is!}
<A>__{reicher paces behind his desk... the corporal still stiff at attention... waits and watches in mortal fear.}

<A>__{the corporal clicks his heels, thrilled that he can go.}
<C>__{corporal}
<D>__{yes sir!!!!}

<C>__{reicher}
<D>__{alright, come in, sit down!}
<A>__{helmut walks to the chair in front of reicher's desk... the spineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the guard is standing at... reicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it. as he looks through the folder, he looks at helmut and looks and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting to helmut as he sweats and waits. reicher is toying with him, and each time reicher looks up the sick, little boy smile crosses helmut's face, hoping to endear himself to this prussian pig! reicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that resembles a throne. it is high and it looks down on helmut. (props: this chair must be higher and taller than helmut's chair... for pov shots diminishing helmut seated there.}

<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i was drunk! it was a mistake! i meant no disrespect... sir... honestly, i was drunk and not responsible for my actions and thoughts! and my actions were subconscious!}

<C>__{reicher}
<D>__{and what kind of commendation would you expect for being a loyal german?}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i want nothing! but i'm more loyal than most germans i know...}
