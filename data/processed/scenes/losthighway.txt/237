<L>__{interior arnie's garage day}
<A>__{pete is on a skate working under a car. the radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive pete crazy it gives him a headache. the tune is one of fred madison's be bop saxophone pieces. pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio. he changes the station. phil, another mechanic working nearby, looks at pete.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{why'd you change it? i liked that.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, i didn't.}
<A>__{pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car, he lays on the skate unable to work. a car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage. pete looks up from under the car he sees the wheels of a cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors. he sees a car door open and mr. eddy's feet appear and walk in his direction. pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car. he stands as mr. eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees back behind mr. eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car a beautiful blonde haired girl, who looks exactly like renee. close up beautiful girl she looks exactly like renee except she is about eight years younger. the girl is staring right into pete's eyes. mr. eddy steps between pete and the girl blocking her from pete. mr. eddy smiles at pete not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between pete and the girl.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{i'm leavin' the caddy, like i told you. think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(regaining his composure)}
<D>__{sure... sure, mr. eddy. you gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{if you think you can finish it, i will be back later today.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it'll be ready.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{you're my man, pete.}
<A>__{mr eddy pinches pete's cheek which pete doesn't like, but aliows. mr. eddy gives pete a big smile then turns, goes back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the pullman is waiting. pete watches her walk and move. he watches her until mr. eddy drives her away. she steals one last glance back at pete before she disappears. when she is gone, pete replays the scene of seeing this beautiful girl over again in his mind. the scene is accompanied by lou reed's version of "this magic moment".}
