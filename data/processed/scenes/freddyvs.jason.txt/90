<A>__{jesse and meagan have fallen asleep. jesse's heart monitor beeps... on the wall, an x ray viewer flickers to life. freddy peeks out from behind the other side. he snickers and ducks back down. suddenly, freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed and grabs jesse, pulling him down into the mattress. meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as jesse grabs onto the curtain. close on curtain rod as the curtain pulls free of the rings. jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing away. meagan looks under the bed nothing. she rises up again, watching as jesse's iv and electrode wires are pulled down after him. meagan grabs a handful of tubes and wire and tries to pull jesse back. but the pull is too strong and meagan goes into the mattress.}
