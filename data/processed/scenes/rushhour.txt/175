<L>__{interior white house conference room dusk}
<A>__{the clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. the president, still on air force one, appears on the video link. cut the tension in the room with a knife? you'd need a chainsaw.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{so what the hell does "kipchak" mean?}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<D>__{uh, it's a code name... for weapons using the yersinia pestis bacillus...}
<A>__{he really doesn't want to be the one telling the president about this.}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{kipchaks were asian nomads. in 1347 they attacked a genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls. the genoese who survived carried the disease back to europe... and it killed half the population.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{get to the goddamn point, major.}
<A>__{the intelligence officer looks at the cia chief.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the pneumonic plague.}
<A>__{the president goes nuts.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{the black plague?! every time i talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse! what happened to this "limited retaliation" shit?}
<C>__{secretary of state}
<D>__{the north koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload. they say we're trying to trick them into aborting the attack.}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{especially since the uplink from our op in p'yungyang was unencrypted.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{we think one of the hard liners switched the warhead without the premier's knowledge. but he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(incredulous; thru video link)}
<D>__{they use a biological weapon on american soil, they have to know we'll respond!}
<C>__{secretary of state}
<D>__{maybe they don't think we got the guts. maybe they want a war, 'cause they think they can whip us, like what happened in 'nam. look who we're dealing with: a teetering, outlaw regime, and inside it, some wild ass renegades working their screwy agenda!}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{what the hell are we doing in l.a.?}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{we've deployed marines from pendleton and twenty nine palms, army from ft. irwin, put 'em in protective suits, but it's 40 minutes before they're on the ground.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{all right. assuming the worst... what'll happen?}
<A>__{the intelligence officer demonstrates with another of his}
<B>__{computer graphics.}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<D>__{the warhead vents the plague bacteria above the target area, infecting about 50,000 people. first symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes become swollen; temperature rises to 105. victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging, usually die the same day.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there are treatments streptomycin and tetracyclines but we'd be overwhelmed by the numbers and its extreme contagiousness.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{we could have 500,000 infected in a week, who knows how many after that.}
<A>__{long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{i'm gonna toast those fuckers! have the summit leaders been warned?}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{yes, sir... no one's landing in l.a. 'til we give the all clear.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{and you're sure it's safe if we can get 'em to destroy the missile in flight?}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<D>__{the bacteria can't survive the heat of an explosion.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{i suggest none of this go any further not even to the agents working to find the family. word leaks out to a city of 12 million people there's rocket full of the plague coming at 'em, you'll create a panic of biblical proportions.}
