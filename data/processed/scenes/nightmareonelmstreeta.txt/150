<L>__{exterior elm street. night.}
<A>__{the sound of the scream cross fades with the wail of the ambulance as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two black and whites and an unmarked car. uniformed policemen spill out foreground. lt thompson and parker exit the unmarked car. by habit or by premonition thompson glances at the house that was his home. his eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs window, white haired, hollow eyed, looking down on him through her bars. she gives a little wave. unnerved, thompson waves back, then walks rapidly for glen's home. mr lantz, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we can hear the mother's wailing inside.}
