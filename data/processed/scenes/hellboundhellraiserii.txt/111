<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{the sucking force is growing stronger by the second. not only is larry's right hand losing its grip on the edge of the wall, but his left arm stretched tight as it clings to kirsty and, via her, tiffany is bleeding profusely again. suddenly, julia appears at the top of the corridor next to larry. in her hand is the white diamond box that kirsty had let drop. she stays just out of range of the sucking wind. she stares at larry's weakening fingers and smiles.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh, poor larry. you never could hold on to anything for very long, could you?}
<A>__{suddenly, audaciously, his face set in a scowl of anger, larry lets go of the wall. before she realises what is happening, he has grabbed julia's wrist and pulled her off her feet into the corridor. he lets go almost immediately and with a superhuman effort grabs at the corner again before the wind can claim him and the girls. julia is not so lucky; without support or foothold, she is seized by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall. she manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to either side of her. for a moment she is hold there and then the pressure begins to draw her in. in her left hand she still holds the box, but her right hand is only a few inches from tiffany's left. tiffany reaches her hand to her, not knowing julia as the others do. their fingers just manage to interlock when julia's face registers a disbelieving shock. there is a terrible ripping sound. julia's new skin, so recently gained, is giving up its hold and has ripped right up the spine. julia is drawn from it.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{noooooooooo!}
<A>__{with a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the skin and disappears down the new corridor. the momentary break in tension allows larry to make one last effort. he rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him. tiffany, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round the corner in her hand. she drops julia's skin to the floor as the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again. still clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond box. as they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance, a glimmer of light. tiffany points excitedly.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{my god, it's her room!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{he starts urging the girls down the corridor a long and very narrow one but kirsty shows some resistance.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no. no, there's something wrong...}
<A>__{before they can discuss it, a new rushing sound is heard. they look back. hurtling towards them is the engineer from hellraiser. tiffany screams.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{jesus. o.k. no more arguments. just run!}
<A>__{they begin one last panic fuelled run down the narrow corridor, the engineer at their heels. the sequence is equivalent to kirsty's pursuit by the engineer in hellraiser, the twist here being that as they approach the entrance into tiffany's room the walls of the corridor, already thin, begin to close together. larry is bringing up the rear (the corridor is now so narrow only single file is possible) and he can almost feel the engineer's breath on his neck.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{go. go. go. go. go!!}
<A>__{finally, almost impossibly, they reach the gap in the wall. tiffany tumbles through, then kirsty, and finally larry. less than a micro second after larry has made it, the walls seal themselves.}
