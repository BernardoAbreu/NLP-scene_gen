<A>__{the soda jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious shrine. he's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry and religious icons (from all the majors) on top of and around the broken cement. currently he's on his knees, rocking back and forth as he prays. and,lo! there came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the soda jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear. and, adam, taking pity on the man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:}
<C>__{adam}
