<A>__{grace is in a quandary. how many seconds before bobby walks in to kill her? or can he really kill her? she's not sure. she looks around the room frantically. picks up a lamp, puts it down. she looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes. suddenly she finds it. a dangerous looking indian hatchet with a feather hanging off its bindings. it's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh. grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. she runs behind the door. a moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and bobby quietly enters, approaching the bed. we sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her. in a reverse pov, bobby sees the outline of grace in the bed as victim...closer, closer. he now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure. he suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence. he spins. she's directly behind him , hatchet raised. his life is in her hands. his eyes, locked in an eternal moment. her eyes, the hatchet.}
