<L>__{exterior dagobah bog clearing dusk}
<A>__{the mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy looking swamp. luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. he ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. taking a power cable, he plugs it into artoo's noselike socket.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ready for some power? okay. let's see now. put that in there. there you go.}
<A>__{the droid whistles his appreciation. luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{now all i have to do is find this yoda... if he even exists.}
<A>__{nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{still... there's something familiar about this place. i feel like... i don't know...}
<C>__{strange voice}
<D>__{feel like what?}
<A>__{luke jumps out of his skin. artoo screeches in terror. the young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker. mysteriously standing right in front of luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. the wizened little thing is dressed in rags. it motions toward luke's sword.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(looking at the creature)}
<D>__{like we're being watched!}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{away with your weapon! i mean you no harm.}
<A>__{after some hesitation, luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why. artoo watches with interest.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i am wondering, why are you here?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm looking for someone.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{looking? found someone, you have, i would say, hmmm?}
<A>__{the little creature laughs.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(trying to keep from smiling)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{help you i can. yes, mmmm.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't think so. i'm looking for a great warrior.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{ahhh! a great warrior.}
<P>__{(laughs and shakes his head)}
<D>__{wars not make one great.}
<A>__{with the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies. he begins to rummage around. artoo moves to the edge of the case standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies and squeaks his disapproval. their tiny visitor pick up the container of food luke was eating from and takes a bite.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{put that down. hey! that's my dinner!}
<A>__{the creature spits out the bite he has taken. he makes a face.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{how you get so big, eating food of this kind?}
<A>__{he flips the container in luke's direction and reaches into one of luke's supply cases.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...}
<C>__{creature}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{aww, cannot get your ship out?}
<A>__{the creature spots something of interest in luke's case. luke loses patience and grabs the case away. the creature retains his prize a tiny power lamp and examines it with delight.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, you could have broken this. don't do that. ohhh... you're making a mess. hey, give me that!}
<C>__{creature}
<P>__{(retreating with the lamp)}
<D>__{mine! or i will help you not.}
<A>__{clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from luke, drawing closer to artoo. as luke and the creature argue, one of artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't want your help. i want my lamp back. i will need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{mudhole? slimy? my home this is.}
<A>__{artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug of war over it. artoo beeps a few angry, "give me thats."}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{ah, ah, ah!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, artoo, let him have it!}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{mine! mine!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo!}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{mine!}
<A>__{the creature lets go with one hand and pokes artoo lightly with one finger. artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{mine!}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(fed up)}
<D>__{now will you move along, little fella? we're got a lot of work to do.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{no! no, no! stay and help you, i will.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{find your friend, hmm?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm not looking for a friend. i'm looking for a jedi master.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{oohhh. jedi master. yoda. you seek yoda.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{mmm. take you to him, i will.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yes, yes. but now, we must eat. come. good food. come.}
<A>__{with that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily. luke stares after him. all he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog. luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.}
<C>__{creature}
<P>__{(in the distance)}
<D>__{come, come.}
<A>__{artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{stay here and watch after the camp, artoo.}
<A>__{artoo beeps even more frantically. but as luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh.}
