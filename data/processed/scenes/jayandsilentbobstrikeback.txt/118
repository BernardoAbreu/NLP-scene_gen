<L>__{exterior lot day}
<A>__{jay and bob race through the lot, with bob carrying suzanne. on a fake new york city street, another movie is shooting. the trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until at the end of the alley, a set golf cart pulls up, and four security guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking their path. jay and bob stop dead, looking back to see the other security guards gaining.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the fuck are we gonna do?}
<A>__{just then, a p.a. on a bike pulls up nearby. he ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front. jay and bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and jump on, putting suzanne in the basket. they start pedaling away furiously, closely followed by the security guard posse. silent bob peddles like mad, racing toward the golf cart.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{punch it!!!}
<A>__{bob pops a wheelie and the bike races up the front of the vehicle, taking flight, below, the security guards stare in awe as jay and silent bob atop the bike with suzanne in the front basket go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a soundstage) a la e.t. jay and bob look down, then at each other. they smile. then they look ahead and let out a scream. the bike crashes through a window in the side of a soundstage building.}
