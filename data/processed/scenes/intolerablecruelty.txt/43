<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe i should grab my mace. i'm a civil attorney. i have little experience with "the criminal mind."}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i'd just like to pick up a few of my things}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't believe you have "things."}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{on the contrary. we're married and we have no pre nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.}
<A>__{marylin walks into the den. sits on the new sofa.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{comfy!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i want to nail you ass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{are you threatening me, because i'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i'm reporting you to the irs.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the irs? they owe me. i'm expecting a refund.}
<A>__{he laughs. she looks at him, dead serious.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm clean with the irs. i've reported every dollar i've ever made. try again, girlfriend.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. i'm talking about }
<A>__{she opens a humidor and takes out a cigar.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{stuff.}
<P>__{(chomping on the cigar)}
<D>__{got a light?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what kind of "stuff?"}
<A>__{she reaches into her purse. pulls out a dunhill and expertly lights the cigar.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{arty farty stuff.}
<P>__{(pointing to the hockney)}
<D>__{lithographs and pre castro cubans. watches and mileage on private jets. stuff, miles. stuff you get from grateful clients.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{those are gifts.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{salary. unreported income.}
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{by the way, what time is it on bellagio road?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you can't prove anything.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i don't have to. that's what the irs guys do. and they do it with great zeal. see, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath.}
<P>__{(puffing on the cigar)}
<D>__{what is this? a romeo and julieta?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're out of your league, marylin. rexroth was a primate. i'm a professional.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i know. so am i, right? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service. he's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of southwestern university very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.}
<P>__{(she stands to leave)}
<D>__{i think it's only fair to warn you: i'm going to file an action, miles. and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{meaning my house.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i believe the residence will be part of the settlement.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{did our marriage ever mean anything to you?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{drop the bogus forgery charge and i will forget about your generous friends slash clients.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's blackmail.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{that's marriage.}
<A>__{she gives him a peck on the cheek. as she leaves:}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{you'll always be my favorite husband.}
<A>__{miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the paintings. he looks at the watch. and the cigars. and the picture of his mother.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{pity you can't be here. you'd enjoy this.}
<B>__{close on a bag of fluids}
<A>__{we pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under herb meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage. she now places it up on the iv gantry and connects, and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. we are once again in herb meyerson's gloomy office, its venetians blocking most of the light and making herb a dark, enigmatic figure.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{this woman has humbled, shamed and disgrazed the entire foim.}
<A>__{a reverse shows miles standing in front of herb's desk.}
<C>__{miles}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i understand herb... i just... for the first time in my career i don't know what to do. i'm a patsy. a sitting duck. i'm lost.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{lost! i will tell you what you can do, you can }
<A>__{he brings himself up short and turns to the nurse.}
<C>__{herb}
