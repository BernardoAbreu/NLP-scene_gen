<A>__{baby is standing in front of her closet staring at her clothes. the walls of her room are covered with b+w photos of movie stars.}
<C>__{baby}
<P>__{(whining)}
<D>__{ma, i can't, i'm busy getting dressed.}
<L>__{interior house dining room}
<A>__{tiny enters and removes his coat. everyone is speechless. tiny is over seven feet tall and weighs three hundred pounds. he is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched into it. a red knit ski mask covers his face. black gloves cover his hands. tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says nothing. mother comes to fetch tiny. she relays a message to him with strange hand gestures. tiny gets up and leaves the room.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you'll have to forgive tiny, he can't hear so much.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yeah, my poor baby. it's his daddy's fault. i mean earl was a good man... i mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{what happened? oh, i'm sorry, it's none of my business.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. i don't think earl ever meant to harm us... but tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{is that why he wears the mask?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yeah, my baby boy gets shy around new people, but he'll warm up to ya... especially the ladies.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{great. i thought i felt a certain attraction between mary and tiny soon as he walked in.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{maybe. he's a real lady killer.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{didn't ya think, mary?}
<A>__{mary just smiles, then gives jerry a dirty look.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, we'll see... the night is young and so are you... oh well, couple more minutes.}
<A>__{mother returns to the kitchen.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(elbows jerry)}
<D>__{don't be such a fucking smart ass.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what i said. you two got to lighten up... right, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{whatever, at this point all i care about is food. i'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{hey, i asked you if you wanted some chicken.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.}
<C>__{jerry}
