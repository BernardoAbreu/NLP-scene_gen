<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i thought you said you'd combed this area?}

<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(looks at martin then to a lieutenant)}

<B>__{the fore deck of the ship}
<A>__{a rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare. ocean same jones, willie and beck stay bunched close together. suddenly willie feels another bump.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{it hit me! where are they?!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i can't see them!}
<A>__{suddenly he is bumped by a shark. willie sees one only two feet away. they are surrounded. suddenly jones stare to taunt the sharks aggressively.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{all right! i've had enough of this shit! you want meat, motherfucker? come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat!}
<A>__{he pushes away from the group despite beck's attempt to stop him.}

<P>__{(to willie and beck)}
<D>__{whoa! did you see those fools run? they know whose boss.}
<A>__{he jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time we see a gash across his forearm.}
<B>__{underwater pov}
<A>__{as jones crows triumphantly, we suddenly see his wet suit ripping along his thighs! surface ocean jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening... we hear the drone of the approaching helicopter...thump, thump, thump...the blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves. it's lights are visible. willie and beck wave frantically as jones drifts closer to them!}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jones' legs his wet suit is now completely split open and we see the black scales spreading!}
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{hovers over the group below and lands on the water. its blades beat the surface into waves. the winch operator hurls out a rescue harness and beck helps willie into the ring. he clicks the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes. before willie can say anything beck falls back and signals the winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. immediately beck locks back at jones and extends his arm.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{jonesy...give me your hand!}
<A>__{willie reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness. the winch operator throws it back across the water where beck grabs the harness.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon, jones!}
<A>__{jones reaches out his hand. he is almost there when}
<B>__{suddenly rising out of the water behind them is the}
<A>__{sixpack bowman creature in all its hideous glory! huge and gruesome, its long teeth glimmer in the light. it goes for}
<B>__{beck but jones moves between them.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{jonesy, no!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{get out of here, becky!}
<A>__{the creature grabs jones and pulls him violently under. beck watches horrified as his friend disappears. numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, we see a boiling of water where jones disappeared...bubbles rising...and then jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from beck. beck reaches out for it just as the creature appears again! it turns and focuses on beck. beck keeps going for the life vest as the creature starts for him.}
<B>__{on helicopter}
<A>__{the winch operator and willie watch in horror as the creature bears down on beck.}
<C>__{winch operator}
<D>__{is he in the harness!}
<A>__{close on jones' tattered vest beck reaches it. his fingers wrap around the bicycle pump like, seismic tool in jones' vest pocket. the creature is right on top of him! chunk, chunk, beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around beck's body in a death grip. it's horrible mouth starts to open.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon, motherfucker open up!}
<A>__{the creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind out of the creature's grasp! the rescue cable is taut! the helicopter is taking off! beck's pov rising shot. beck rises suddenly out of the water, the creature growing instantly smaller below him until boom! the seismic device explodes in the sixpack bowman creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface! the shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with beck safely attached by cable below it. the winch operator pulls him in.}
