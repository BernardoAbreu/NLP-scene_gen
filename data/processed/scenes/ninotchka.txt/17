<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{royal suite}
<A>__{ninotchka enters, followed by the three russians, who by now are frightened to death.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{this is the apartment we have reserved for you, comrade yakushova. i hope you like it.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(glancing around the tremendous room)}
<D>__{which part of the room is mine?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{you see... it is a little different here. they don't rent rooms in pieces. we had to take the whole suite.}
<A>__{ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter on the desk.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how much does this cost?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{two thousand francs.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{a week?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{a day.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{do you know how much a cow costs, comrade iranoff?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{a cow?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{two thousand francs. if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows.}
<P>__{(with an outburst of emotion)}
<D>__{who am i to cost the russian people seven cows?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{we had to take it on account of the safe.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{for ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.}
<A>__{ninotchka takes lenin's picture from her bags.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this.}
<P>__{(she puts the}
<D>__{photograph on the}
<P>__{desk)}
<D>__{comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we did our best, comrade.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i hope so for your sake.}
<P>__{(she sits at her desk}
<D>__{and starts to type}
<P>__{her report)}
<D>__{let us examine the case. what does the lawyer say?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{which lawyer?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you didn't get legal advice?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{we didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. they are very expensive here. if you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess. i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i will not repeat your mistake. i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative.}
<A>__{ninotchka continues to type. the three russians watch her nervously. each click pounds on their consciences.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{comrade buljanoff...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{yes, comrade?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{do you spell buljanoff with one or two f's?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(with fright in his voice)}
<D>__{with two f's, if you please.}
<A>__{ninotchka goes on with her typing. suddenly she looks up at iranoff, who becomes self conscious and fixes his tie. as he does so he sees that ninotchka's glance is concentrated on the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to remove. he knows it is too late to do anything about it except to stand one foot behind the other, as ninotchka types faster, the clicking of her keys twice as loud. ninotchka picks up the telephone.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{will you send me some cigarettes, please?}
<P>__{(suddenly getting up)}
<D>__{comrades, i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state.}
<P>__{(with utmost gravity)}
<D>__{you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. and you three comrades...}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we did it with the best intentions...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions. fifty per cent to a so called duchess!... half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! comrade kopalski, go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{yes, comrade.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you, comrade iranoff, go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{is there anything i can do, comrade?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you might get me an accurate map of paris. i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{yes, comrade.}
<A>__{the buzzer rings.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the three cigarette girls enter.}
<C>__{cigarette girls}
<P>__{(gaily)}
<D>__{hello! hello! cigarettes?}
<A>__{ninotchka looks up astonished. seeing her, the cigarette girls freeze. the russians stand by quietly.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(looking at the russians)}
<D>__{comrades, you seem to have been smoking a lot.}
