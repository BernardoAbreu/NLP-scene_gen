<L>__{exterior anzio, train station day}
<A>__{and out of the steam... carla comes walking toward guido, swinging her hips, with a porter behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon. carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. she wears it with pride.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{guido! ciao!}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(to himself, remembering how much work she is)}
<D>__{carla.}
<P>__{(and now to her, covering his ambivalence)}
<D>__{carla!}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i'm so happy to see you.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{carlissima.}
<A>__{she gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him in public.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i missed you so much.}
<P>__{(they move off)}
<D>__{are you happy i'm here?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{but very happy? or just a little happy?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{very happy.}
<A>__{she sees something in his face that worries her.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what's wrong? you look very tired, very tired.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(avoiding this, looks at her bags)}
<D>__{carla, all those bags for the weekend?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{yes, the bellavista is a very fashionable place. you know i stayed there with my parents, during the war, it was full of germans.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{carla... i have to tell you... they found out who i am at the hotel }
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{... yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so i found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here. it's charming.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{here at the station?}
