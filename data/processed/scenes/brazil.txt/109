<A>__{alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily armed guards leap out, their guns trained on jill as she appears to be the only person around.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{drop it!!}
<A>__{jill has only the form in her hand which she dutifully drops. she is terrified by the suddenness and size of the response to her hitting the desk. the guards close in. sam rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. he can't believe the sight that greets him. he responds instinctively,}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{stop! let her go!}
<A>__{he rushes over to the porter's desk just as the guards behind him come through the door. he doesn't have a clue what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of guards they snap attention. confused he looks around and then realizes his i.d. badge, is on his lapel and the guards are responding as trained. the guards chasing him screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to attention. everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant to make the next move. sam breaks the silence.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well done ... uh ... excellent work ... quick thinking. i will take charge of her now ...}
<A>__{realising he has jill's dossier, he shows it to everyone her print out pictures are on the front page. it's a classified matter ... i will include your fine handling of the situation in my report sam is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive toy present he hands it to the porter.}
