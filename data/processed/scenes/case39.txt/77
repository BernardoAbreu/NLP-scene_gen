<A>__{emily nods yes. barron, gently, mindful of lucy's age:}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{we're trying to figure out why. he got a call thursday night from this number. i'm just wondering if he might have said anything...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it wasn't me.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{you didn't call him?}
<A>__{lucy shakes her head. barron nods okay, then, speaking to her as a father might his own daughter:}

<D>__{lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but i know you will because you're a good little girl.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i am telling the truth.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{my backup files are in your room. diego's is in there. maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it wasn't me, i swear.}
<A>__{complete innocence. emily nods okay, wanting to believe, but remembering the stolen photograph.}
