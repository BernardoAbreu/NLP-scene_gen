<L>__{interior loring house den afternoon}
<A>__{as they move into the living room, juno sits down and motions for mark to join her on the couch.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{park it, dude.}
<A>__{mark sits down. with great fanfare, juno retrieves a dark, glossy sheet from the envelope. it's her ultrasound.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{behold, good sir! the very first photo of your future child.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're kidding!}
<A>__{mark examines the ultrasound, baffled.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i think it kind of looks like my friend, paulie.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{oh, is he bald and amorphous?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, he's the dad.}
<A>__{mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered that her baby might have a father. he stands up and holds the photo up to the light critically.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the doctor can tell, but i decided not to know. i want it to be a big surprise.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, it can really only go two ways.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{that's what you think. i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter babies that's born without junk.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{junk?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you know... it's parts...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know what junk is.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we definitely want it to have junk.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well don't worry about it. my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. she won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m&ms. hope you're ready.}
<A>__{mark chuckles.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wait...do you hear that?}
<A>__{a new song has begun. mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo. juno follows him toward the source of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's only my favorite song. it's sonic youth doing "superstar" by the carpenters.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{i've heard the carpenters before. chick drummer and freaky dude. not unlike the white stripes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you haven't heard the carpenters like this. listen.}
<A>__{mark grabs the stereo remote off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar. mark and juno stand in silence in the kitchen. mark mouths along with the lyrics.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(lipsynching)}
<D>__{don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hey, i like this.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this album is all carpenters covers by alt rock bands. it's called if i were a carpenter. it is god. i will rip a copy for you before you leave.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you don't have to do that.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's the least i can do. what did you say your favorite band was?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i didn't. but it's a three way tie between the stooges, patti smith and the runaways.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, i definitely need to make you some cds. at least while my kid is hanging out in there.}
<A>__{he gestures at juno's burgeoning paunch. mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling cd's. he's got a carpenter's disc, the "no alternative" charity compilation, and mother love bone. juno spots a vhs tape on the coffee table and picks it up.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(reading title)}
<D>__{the wizard of gore?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{oh yeah. it's herschel gordon lewis. he's the ultimate master of horror.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{please. dario argento is the ultimate master of horror.}
<A>__{mark swivels around slowly on his desk chair, surprised.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{argento's good, but lewis is completely demented. we're talking buckets of goo. red corn syrup everywhere. and fake brains up the yin yang.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(examining the tape box)}
<D>__{frankly, this looks kind of stupid.}
<A>__{mark gives a look "oh, really?"}
