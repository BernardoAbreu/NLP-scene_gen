<A>__{the front door opens, lynn carries cole in. he's asleep on her shoulder. she carries him down the hall to his bedroom. lynn lays cole gently on his bed next to his german shepherd puppy. cole curls up with sebastian. lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. he looks like a four year old. lynn has been carrying cole's sweater from over her shoulder. she pulls it off and begins to fold it. her attention is drawn to the sweater. she fingers the fabric of the back. it's ripped. her eyes move to cole. in the middle of the back of his t shirt are three small tears. lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail like scratches on his skin. lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.}
