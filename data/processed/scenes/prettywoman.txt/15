<L>__{exterior hollywood blvd. night}
<A>__{vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone. a babbling street type goes by happily talking to himself. he wears an "i love hollywood" t shirt. vivian passes tourists but doesn't notice them any more than she pays attention to the vagrant she passes further on, huddle in a doorway. a long haired kid on a skateboard goes by dropping off little bags to various street types. a barker type stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut out of a movie star. some go in. vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking japanese tourists. a black prostitute in a mini skirt strolls toward her. a car passes. the driver stares at vivian with interest. she ignores him. the black prostitute approaches the car.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?}
<A>__{the driver looks her over. the black prostitute gets in the car and it drives away. a group of men, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night coffee shop. they whistle and make obscene gestures and sounds as vivian hurries by. she ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand. half a dozen people sit at dirty tables inside.}
