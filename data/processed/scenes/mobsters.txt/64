<A>__{conversation dies as charlie moves through the restaurant, looking considerably more poised and commanding then last we saw him here with capone. all eyes follow him as he moves toward the private dining room in back.}
<B>__{as charlie enters the back room}
<A>__{don maranzano rises to greet him, hands held up beside his face, like the pope bestowing a blessing. he embraces charlie, whose face betrays his deep annoyance with this phony intimacy.}

<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{words of praise are meant only for the great, and you, my son, will do great things.}
<A>__{charlie's ready to spit in the old man's face, but missing the hostility, maranzano holds his right hand up to charlie's face. a signet ring with the initials "s.m.", gleams on his finger.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{my bambino, please.}
<A>__{choking back his pride, charlie kisses the ring. the don glows.}

<A>__{maranzano leans back in his chair, appraising charlie.}

<A>__{maranzano slaps his palm on the table.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{you are of the sicilian blood. you waste your time with these jews!}
<A>__{charlie lets that comment hang in the air for a moment, then pushes his chair away from the table.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{thanks for lunch.}
<A>__{calming down, maranzano waves away the disagreement. pours charlie a glass of wine.}
