<L>__{exterior southampton docks titanic day}
<A>__{a view of titanic from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. the steamer's whistle echoes across southampton. pull back, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. it is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew. just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. four men, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand. jack dawson and fabrizio de rossi, both about 20, exchange a glance as the other two players argue in swedish. jack is american, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times. he is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. he is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in paris. he is also very self possessed and sure footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15. the two swedes continue their sullen argument, in swedish.}
