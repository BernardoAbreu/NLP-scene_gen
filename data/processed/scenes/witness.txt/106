<L>__{interior schaeffer's office night}
<A>__{carter sits, schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences grow before he strikes again with another softly snarled question or statement.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{you know where he is.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{wrong.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{you'd lie to protect him.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{probably.}
<A>__{schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{you admit you're lying?}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{i admit i don't know where he is.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{you're the first one he'll contact.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{he's got my number.}
<A>__{schaeffer stops, stands in front of carter, takes a deep breath... suddenly smiles. and is abruptly (as he is capable of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. he even chuckles as he begins:}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{it's funny. i know he's hiding somewhere with the amish, i know it.}
<P>__{(a quick glance at carter)}
<D>__{can you imagine john book at a prayer meeting? our john book?}
<A>__{schaeffer chuckles again, looks hopefully again at carter. carter looks back, stony eyed. schaeffer makes another abrupt shift in form... but still speaks softly.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{either you're a member of the club or you aren't, elton.}
<P>__{(he nods his head, as)}
<D>__{tell me what you know...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{what i know, paul, is...}
<P>__{(nodding his head)}
<D>__{he's going to take you out...}
