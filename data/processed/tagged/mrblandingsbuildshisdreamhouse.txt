<A>__{as camera moves up it and toward a window:}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{for fourteen years jim and muriel had been living in their apartment over on east seventy fourth street. it was just another of those wonderful crisp september mornings and the blandings were still asleep. just like millions of other people in good old manhattan new york city u.s.a.}
<A>__{the camera goes through the window and into:}
<L>__{interior the blandings' bedroom day}
<A>__{jim (cary grant) and muriel (myrna loy) blandings are asleep in twin beds. the room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge take up an inordinate amount of space. sound of an alarm clock going off. jim awakens, yawns himself into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for the clock; it isn't there. he slips out of bed, and rubbing his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. the circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock. he turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. we get the feeling that jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life. back at his bed, jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes with his feet for his slippers. before he can find them, however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow, pulling the covers over him. in a moment he is sound asleep. muriel's arm automatically stretches out and shakes jim into consciousness. as he painfully reawakens and starts to rise, muriel's arm disappears. we get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of the blandings' daily routine. jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens the door.}
<L>__{interior the closet}
<A>__{this is a fairly good sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not jim and muriel blandings. assuming that they had started out on even terms, it is now obviously muriel, three to one. her dresses, gowns, slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit or sports coat. her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance. groping blindly for a robe, jim feels around and pulls one out. as he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small for him, obviously muriel's. in disgust he attempts to put it back. unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor. as he bends down and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor. he drags the robe out and dons it, leaving the dresses where they fell. with a guilty look at muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall.}
<L>__{interior the hall}
<A>__{a narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. off it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room and the foyer. jim shuffles down the hall. he stops at the closed bathroom door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.}
<C>__{betsy's voice}
<D>__{okay, dad.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the children's room, knocks. no sound. he opens the door and enters.}
<L>__{interior children's bedroom}
<A>__{a small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements of adolescence. joan, an eleven year old is asleep in one of the twin beds. jim automatically pulls the covers clear off joan's bed. she awakens, cocks an eye at him.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{okay, dad.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{as she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, jim exits into the hall.}
<L>__{interior the hall}
<A>__{camera follows jim through the foyer into the living room, on through the very small combination dining and breakfast nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. gussie, the colored cook, greets him heartily.}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{'morning, mr. blandings!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a feeble attempt at a smile)}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, stirs and hands it to jim who gulps it down, makes a slight face and pats his stomach. gussie hands jim a cup of black coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior the hall}
<A>__{gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, jim approaches the door to the children's room. with split second timing, he pauses as the door flies open and joan, in her bathrobe, towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. she disappears into the bathroom. jim carefully proceeds down the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to the left as the door bursts open and betsy flies by on the way back to her bedroom. all this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which knute rockne might have been proud. jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior the blandings' bedroom}
<A>__{muriel is still asleep as jim enters, walks over, nudges her.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{mm?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{coffee.}
<A>__{muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, takes the cup.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{thank you, dear.}
<A>__{they kiss briefly. muriel starts to sip the coffee as jim goes to his chest of drawers. it consists of several rows of small drawers above and large drawers below. jim ruffles through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look through the other drawers.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{looking for something, dear?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(briefly)}
<D>__{my socks.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{why don't you look in your sock drawer?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with restraint)}
<D>__{that's where i found my underwear.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{well, try your underwear drawer.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm in my underwear drawer.}
<A>__{he reaches in and holds up one of muriel's silk slips.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sipping coffee)}
<D>__{well, they must be somewhere.}
<P>__{(attempt at morning cheeriness)}
<D>__{socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(strained patience)}
<D>__{muriel, i thought the top two and a half drawers were to be mine! i wish you'd tell gussie }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{the closet! that's where they are. we put them in the closet.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{socks? in the closet?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and there's so much of it in the closet!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{...so gussie and i decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, thanks a lot!}
<A>__{he strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. as he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. about to explode, he looks at muriel.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim, i do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(barely containing himself)}
<D>__{i will try, dear.}
<A>__{jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. with bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. pause. silence. he picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. jim exchanges a look with muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee.}
<L>__{interior the hall}
<A>__{jim opens the door of the bathroom. there is a scream. he quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. a moment later the door opens and joan emerges, wrapping her robe around her.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{father, just one morning i wish you'd knock!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to her back as she walks away)}
<D>__{'morning, dear.}
<A>__{joan disappears into her room as jim enters the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior the bathroom}
<A>__{very small with a stall shower. jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. he takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. he examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns. what he sees the toothpaste tube what he sees the toothpaste tube. it has been squeezed in the middle, one of blandings' pet peeves. close shot jim meticulously smoothes out the tube close shot jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. as he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens. close shot the medicine cabinet close shot the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life. close shot jim close shot jim. as he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. jim makes a desperate one handed catch, still brushing his teeth. as he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. a bottle of cough medicine falls out. he catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. he looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. he finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. he reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. he reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray jim blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. he starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "home on the range."}

<B>__{jim}
<A>__{jim he stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. over scene we hear muriel's voice from the shower. she is singing a lusty chorus of "home on the range." jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. he reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. with weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. as he clears one section another clouds up. by the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. he grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. as he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself. the mirror cleared off, jim relathers, starts to shave. during this, muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.}

<P>__{(reaching for toothbrush)}
<D>__{excuse...}
<A>__{she takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste. jim, automatically following the mirror, has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving. close shot muriel close shot muriel. she takes the tube from the cabinet and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to her brush.}

<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you don't mean that.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{every word of it! anybody who builds a house today is crazy! the minute you start, they put you on the list. the all american sucker list! everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. if you take out their hands, they find more pockets!}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{it's a conspiracy, i tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! against every boy and girl who were ever in love!}
<A>__{tesander clears his throat. jim turns.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<A>__{a slight embarrassed pause. then:}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(shyly)}
<D>__{well, mr. blandings, there's a matter of twelve dollars and eighty six cents.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with a wild gleam)}
<D>__{twelve dollars and eighty six cents! why be a piker, mr. tesander?}
<P>__{(emptying pockets)}
<D>__{take everything i've got! spread it out among your pals!}
<P>__{(advancing toward the bewildered tesander)}
<D>__{wouldn't retch like a little something? maybe zucca could use my new dinner jacket? it's open house, mr. tesander! help yourself! if this isn't enough i will come over to your place and do some odd chores. maybe i can mow your lawn or scratch your back!}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{you don't understand, mr. blandings. this twelve dollars and eighty six cents you don't owe me, i owe you.}
<A>__{there is a momentary pause.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...w what was that?}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(taking out money)}
<D>__{found i overcharged you. almost three feet.}
<A>__{he hands the money to jim, who stares at it blankly.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{better count it. i think it's all there.}
<A>__{jim looks haplessly at muriel, sheepish, guilty.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{thank you very much, mr. tesander.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{well, i guess i'd better be gettin' along.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{sure got a pretty place here.}
<P>__{(at door; pauses; looks back)}
<D>__{i will tell mr. zucca about the dinner jacket.}
<A>__{jim and muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.}
<L>__{interior the foyer}
<A>__{as tesander is about to exit, bill, dressed, starts down the stairs.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, mr. tesander could you give me a lift to town?}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{be right with you.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{what did you mean before about losing your job? will we really have to sell the house?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(miserable)}
<D>__{i don't know, dear... i don't know.}
<A>__{bill enters.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{in case anyone's interested, i'm leaving for town.}
<P>__{(for jim's benefit)}
<D>__{if you want to count the silverware, i will wait.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{bill, be patient with me. maybe one of these days i will grow up.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to muriel)}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{twelve dollars and eighty six cents.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mind if i say something?}
<A>__{jim and muriel look at him curiously.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know, i've kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project. every step of the way i was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced, bilked, rooked, flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners. and maybe you were. maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would. maybe there were times when you wished you'd never started the whole thing. but when i look around and see what you two have here i don't know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head. maybe those are the things that really count... see you around.}
<A>__{as bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening and the kids appear. there is an exchange of "hi's" as they pass.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{'morning, everybody!}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hi, dad! how come you're not at the office?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a look at muriel)}
<D>__{i'm on a... kind of a vacation.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you mean you got fired?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, not exactly, i }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{we'll discuss it later.}
<A>__{gussie's head appears from the kitchen.}
<C>__{gussie}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{come and get it! breakfast everybody.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{good! i'm starving! what are we having, gussie?}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{orange juice, scrambled eggs and you know what.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(making a face)}
<D>__{ham?}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{not ham wham!}
<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{if you ain't eatin' wham, you ain't eatin' ham!}
<A>__{gussie's head disappears. close shot jim. close shot jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<A>__{he reacts with the sudden exhilaration of balboa first seeing the pacific. he snaps his fingers.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{darling, give gussie a ten dollar raise!}
<A>__{his eyes light up as he begins to visualize.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{insert advertisement in magazine it is a picture of gussie, smiling, holding a platter with an enormous ham. under it, the simple caption:}
<D>__{"if you ain't eatin' wham, you ain't eatin' ham!"}
<B>__{the camera angle widens to disclose mr. james blandings}
<A>__{the camera angle widens to disclose mr. james blandings reclining in a hammock on the patio of his dream house. in the b.g. muriel is working at her garden, joan and betsy assisting her. jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and picks up a book which he has been reading. as the camera comes in for an extreme close shot of jim we see the title of the book on the jacket cover. it reads:}
<D>__{"mr. blandings builds his dream house"}
<A>__{jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the camera and winks.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with simple sincerity)}
<D>__{drop in and see us sometime.}
