<L>__{interior coffey's cell day}
<A>__{coffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. he stirs at the sound of giggling. he sits up, peers curiously through the bars. softly:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{del?}
<B>__{at the guard station}
<A>__{paul glances up from writing in the daily log. silence now. he goes back to writing and the giggling comes again.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{delacroix? that you?}
<A>__{no answer. just more giggling. paul rises, walks down the mile to delacroix's cell and stops, staring in through the bars. paul's inner office brutal and dean are having lunch. paul pokes his head in.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you are not gonna believe this.}
<B>__{resume e block}
<A>__{the men follow paul onto the mile. by now, del is cackling wildly in his cell. brutal shoots paul a look has he gone insane? paul gestures "see for yourself." they arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on del's shoulder. del looks up, giggling like a kid at christmas.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{look! i done tame me dat mouse!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we see that.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{watch dis! watch what he do!}
<A>__{he stretches out his left arm. the mouse crawls over the top of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns around and scampers back. the guards just stand there, staring.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{ain't he sumpthin now? ain't mr. jingles smart?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mr. jingles?}
<C>__{del}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i notice your english gets better when you want something.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{wanna see what else he can do? watch, watch, watch...}
<A>__{he puts the mouse on the floor, grabs a small wooden spool. the mouse sees it, poises like a man getting ready for a race.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{we play fetch, mr. jingles? we play fetch?}
<A>__{he tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the wall. the mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick and proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its front paws all the way to delacroix's feet. by now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. paul's got a funny little chill running up his spine.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{he fetch it ever' time. smart as hell, ain't he? we do da trick again, watch, watch, watch...}
<A>__{again he throws the spool. again the mouse goes after it, starts rolling it back. del howls with laughter, claps his hands like a kid. brutal murmurs to the others:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{who's training who here?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{that's some smart mouse, del. like he's a circus mouse or something.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{a circus mouse! dat jus' what he is, too! a circus mouse! i get outta here, he make me rich, see if he don't!}
<A>__{he picks up the spool again, makes a drumroll sound, tosses it. the mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back... ...as percy enters the scene. del catches sight of him and scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. he tries to hide mr. jingles in his hands but the mouse wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head, where he regards percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{well, well. looks like you found yourself a new friend, eddie.}
<A>__{del tries to offer some defiance but all he can manage is:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?}
<A>__{percy shrugs as if to say "no skin off me", looks to paul.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{that the one i chased?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(level)}
<D>__{yes, that's the one. only del says his name is mr. jingles.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{is that so?}
<A>__{paul trades a look with the others, everybody wondering just what the hell's going through percy's mind.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{del was just asking for a box. he thinks the mouse will sleep in it, i guess. that he might keep it for a pet. what do you think?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{i think it'll shit up his nose some night and run away, but i guess that's del's lookout.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we oughtta find a cigar box. get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with. that should do real nice.}
<A>__{percy walks away, leaving them dumbstruck. paul turns to the others. of all the things they've seen in the last few minutes, percy being nice is the most amazing of all.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{man said get a cigar box.}
