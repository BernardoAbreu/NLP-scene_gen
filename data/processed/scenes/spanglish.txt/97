<A>__{as the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and waves..cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes never leave her. she gasps frequently..major giant organic gasps of wonder and pleasure..this is awe as an active physical exercise. the moving shot dramatizes the crossroads of the mother daughter relationship as the two shot finds flor becoming first blurred then lost as we focus on cristina exclaiming over each new sight.}
