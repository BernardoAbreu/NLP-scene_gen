<L>__{interior living room dusk}
<B>__{the family and the investigators}
<A>__{everyone is assembled around the console tv. ryan has a nakamichi cassette recorder on the coffee table and a pencil microphone taped to the television speaker. tak has erected his nikon on a small aluminum tripod aimed at the screen, plus two infrared heat seeking cameras and monitors which scan the entire living room. an electrostatic locator to measure ionization and a magnometer that measures magnetic changes. diane is holding steve’s hand. dana comes into the room with an overnight bag strapped around her shoulders.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{dana, i’d like you to meet doctor...}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(clipped)}
<D>__{it’s getting dark, mom. i gotta go. i’ll call you from trudie’s.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{she won’t stay in the house after dusk.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{she’s got brains!}
<A>__{diane flips on the set. a local news station is finishing the report when diane turns to channel 27.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{we receive better on this channel but don’t ask me why.}
<A>__{dr. lesh is thoroughly perplexed. she puts on her glasses as steve turns out the lamp and lights a cigarette. diane squeezes her husband’s hand. the camera pushes in to the tv screen and millions of particles of white air. diane turns the volume up and ryan, wearing headsets, flinches, adjusting down the volume on his recorder.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i’ll call her.}
<A>__{she says this so matter of factly that dr. lesh gasps. diane walks to the center of the living room, folds her hands in front of her, collecting her thoughts, takes a very deep breath and calls to the ceiling.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{it’s mommy, sweetheart. we want to talk to you. baby, please answer. please talk to me, carol anne.}
<A>__{dr. lesh looks quickly to tak and ryan for their human responses to this. tak shrugs unnoticed. ryan adjusts in his chair and looks up at the ceiling. e. buzz prances into the room, looking up as if following on the heels of someone with a treat.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(to tak breathlessly)}
<D>__{look at the dog.}
<A>__{he sits up on his hind legs and begs to no one we see.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{are you with us now? can you say hello to daddy? say hello to daddy, baby.}
<A>__{close ryan he tries hard not to smile. no matter. the suppressed laugh is slapped away by what he now hears. ryan grabs his headsets in two hands, pressing them hard to his ears.}
<C>__{tak}
<P>__{(tight whisper)}
<D>__{good lord...}
<A>__{everyone turns away from diane and back to the tv. they strain their hearing, leaning forward, watching...}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(softly, sweetly, far away)}
<D>__{hello, daddy.}
<C>__{page missing }
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{carol anne. where is this light?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{tell her to stay away from it!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{tell her, diane!!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{sweetheart, the light is dangerous. don’t go near it. don’t look at the light.}
<A>__{tak speaks into dr. lesh’s ear.}
<C>__{tak}
<D>__{i can’t believe it. it’s just a zenith. but the voice could be c.b. broadcasting from somewhere in the house. i’m taking a look.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{it’s not a hoax.}
<C>__{tak}
<D>__{we’ll see.}
<A>__{tak takes off. e. buzz barks into the air twice and catches something in his mouth. no sooner does dr. lesh catch this out of the corner of her eye when several midair electrical discharges illuminate the room.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{what’s that?!}
