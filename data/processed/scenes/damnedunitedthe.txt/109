<A>__{clough watches from the touch line as the game is in progress. "crash", a leeds player scythes into a derby player. "beeep", the referee blows his whistle. clough and leaps off his bench in fury. shouting abuse..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{you're a bloody disgrace! you should be in the book for that, cherry!}
<A>__{"beeep", the referee blows his whistle. revie smiles to himself as a derby player is carried off on a stretcher.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you're an animal. a fucking animal, hunter!}
<A>__{sam longson watches from the director's box. he closes his eyes. peter taylor witnesses this.. "crunch", another brutal tackle, another whistle. another derby player hobbles off the pitch. blood streaming from a cut to his head..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{i will see you in fucking court, lorimer!}
<A>__{clough's eyes meet revie's eyes along the touchline.}
