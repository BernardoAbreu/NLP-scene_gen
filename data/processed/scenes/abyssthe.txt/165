<A>__{bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, i will.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{lindsey! wait a second }
<A>__{she reaches the watertight door to maintenance room b. it's locked. before bud can stop her she grabs a fire extinguisher off the wall and pounds on the steel door like a big gong. boom! boom! boom! needless to say, it opens. she pushes past schoenick, see the bomb lying there naked.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig! with everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{you don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you're right... i don't. i just need to know that this thing is out of here! you hear me, roger ramjet?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{mrs. brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission. i believe the stress is affecting you.}
<P>__{(to schoenick)}
<D>__{escort her to quarters and have monk prepare a tranquilizer.}
<A>__{schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{bullshit, you can't do that. oww... goddamnit!}
<A>__{lindsey goes bananas, trying to get schoenick's big hands off her arms. bud slams his hand down on the intercom button.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{emergency! maintenance room b. emergency!}
<A>__{he pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on coffey... warning him with a look that is not to be messed with. coffey is braced back against the worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back. suddenly there's a crowd outside the door as catfish, hippy, one night, and sonny come running up. confrontation time. sirens going. about a million volts of electricity in the air. bud braces schoenick.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{let her go. do it... right now.}
<A>__{he does. lindsey jerks away. rubs her arms.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you dumb jarhead motherf }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{chill out, lindsey!!}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<A>__{everyone is frozen in place. bud a coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring. bud pulls lindsey back into the corridor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{nothing. we were just leaving.}
<P>__{(to her)}
<D>__{weren't we?}
<A>__{angle from behind coffey, as bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor. hands behind his back. in his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the .45. he turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind. he seems to sag. when he looks at schoenick, his eyes are wounds. a hunted animal. voice shaky.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{they can't be trusted. they're turning against us. we may have to take... steps.}
