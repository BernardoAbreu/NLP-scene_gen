<L>__{exterior stern later}
<A>__{chuck sits alone, away from the others, reading. on cue, half of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and screaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side. the guys cheer.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{come on you guys, this isn't funny!}
<A>__{the seat spins, twists and swings from behind the boat.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on chucky. show us a little grit.}
<A>__{they lower the chair so it glides just above the surface. when the boat noses into a swell chuck gets quite a ride. once he has the hang of it, fear turns to elation.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeee haaaa!!!!!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay, who's next?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding? he's a human chum line!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.}
<A>__{chuck's hauled back in and terry pushes his way to the front of the line.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i'm next!}
<A>__{terry goes over the side. once he gets the hang of it, he gets into it. he maneuvers the chair like a plane, forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back to the surface.}
<B>__{off the port side}
<A>__{robin is trolling. the line takes a tremendous hit and robin's reel screams. tod is at the wheel and turns.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{there she blows!!}
<A>__{two hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken the bait. the crew turn and look. skipper looks out at terry still in the bowswain's chair.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{get him in.}
<A>__{bill waves at terry to come on in.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on in!!!}
<A>__{terry waves him off and disappears back under the waves. they can't pull him up while he's going under the water.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{do it now bill.}
<A>__{terry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in. suddenly the animal on the other end of robin's line explodes out of the sea. it's a six foot thresher shark. terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and screaming.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{get me out!!! get me out!!!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh my god!! it's a...}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{shark.}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{don't lose it son.}
<A>__{george grabs a gaffing hook while robin fights the rod, trying to bring in the big fish.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{keep it coming.}
<A>__{robin battles the fish. george clumsily tries to help. the crew make their way to the rear to watch.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{charlie and rick and the others heave to get terry up. finally he makes it. sprawling onto the deck.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{oh jesus! oh jesus christ!!}
<A>__{the crew turn and cheer robin on as he brings the shark alongside.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he must be two hundred pounds! bring him in close and try to hold him steady.}
<A>__{george leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook into a gill. several of the boys hold onto him as the fish flops around violently.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{got him!}
<A>__{skipper comes down to inspect the catch. the shark is longer than terry is tall and thrashes in the the water, snapping and twisting. terry stands shaking, freaked. all of them are.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{damn terr, you're whiter than sister mary anne's butt.}
<A>__{the guys laugh nervously. terry just stares at the man eater, but it's infectious. after a moment he's laughing too. skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{well, now you have something to write home about.}
<A>__{more laughter. suddenly, tom, who is lookout on the foretop, cries out.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{land ho!!! land ho!!!}
<A>__{everyone turns around to look. the guys at the stern let go of george and he nearly tumbles overboard. in that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea. robin and george share a stunned look.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{there's more where that came from.}
<A>__{skipper returns to the wheelhouse with alice. together they scan the horizon. clouds build over the land ahead.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{cheated death again.}
<A>__{he slips an arm around her.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{yep.}
