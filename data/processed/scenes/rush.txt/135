<L>__{interior intensive care unit day}
<A>__{niki's p.o.v: feels someone touching his forehead and his hands with oil...and the sound of a woman weeping...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{...durch diese heilige salbung helfe dir der herr in seinem reichen erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der kraft des heiligen geistes...}
<A>__{niki's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see an elderly priest is giving him the last rites in german.. the sound of marlene crying somewhere in the room.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{der herr der dich von sunden befreit, rette dich in seiner gnade richte er dich auf...}
<A>__{niki strains to move. a sense of excruciating pain. he fights to open his eyes, give an indication...any indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive and able to fight for life... but to no avail. the priest continues giving last rites. marlene continues to cry. the priest touches niki's shoulder...}
<P>__{niki (v o)}
<D>__{i'm here! can't you tell? i'm here!}
<A>__{niki screams inside. wanting to be heard. wanting to give them a sign. he's ok. he's still there. but it's no use. niki blacks out again. the pain is too great.}
