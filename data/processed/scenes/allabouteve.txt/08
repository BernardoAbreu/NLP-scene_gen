<L>__{interior margo's dressing room curran theater night}
<A>__{it is a medium sized box, lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster. it is furnished in beat up wicker. a door leads to an old fashioned bathroom. margo is at the dressing table. she wears an old wrapper, her hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle. also before her is an almost finished drink. lloyd richards is stretched out on the wicker chaise. he's in his late thirties, sensitive, literate. between them, by the dressing table, is birdie margo's maid. her age is unimportant. she was conceived during a split week in walla walla and born in a carnival riot. she is fiercely loyal to margo. karen enters during the line margo started while she was outside. lloyd chuckles, birdie cackles.}

<D>__{hi.}

<D>__{hello, darling }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{hi.}

<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{the minute it gets printed they're gonna fire on gettysburg all over again...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it was fort sumter they fired on }
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i never played fort sumter.}
<A>__{she takes the wig into the bathroom. margo starts creaming the make up off her face.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{honey chili had a pointerior you know, i can remember plays about women even from the south where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that was way back...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{within your time, buster. lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.}
<A>__{birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{you need new girdles.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{buy some.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{the same size?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{of course!}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{well. i guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.}
<A>__{she picks up lloud empty glass, asks "more"? he shakes his head. she pours herself a quick one.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{margo does not play a lunatic, birdie.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i know. she just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's the tight girdle that does it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'aged in wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play }
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{ 'at's my loyal little woman.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so packed houses, tickets for months in advance i can't see that either of lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!}

<P>__{(grins)}

<C>__{karen}

<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{ain't it the truth?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes, it is! you're talented, famous, wealthy people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{autograph fiends! they're not people those little beast who run in packs like coyotes }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{they're your fans, your audience }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{they're nobody's fans! they're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even they're never indoors long enough!}
<A>__{there is a pause. lloyd applauds lightly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well... there's one indoors now. i've brought her back to see you.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you've what?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{she's just outside the door.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(to birdie; also a whisper)}
<D>__{the heave ho.}
<A>__{birdie starts. karen stops her. it's all in whisper, now, until eve comes in.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you can't put her out, i promised... margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book }
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that book is out of print, karen, those days are gone. fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you'd only see her, you're her whole life you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{kind of mousy trench coat and funny hat?}
<P>__{(karen nods)}
<D>__{how could i miss her? every night and matinee well...}
<A>__{she looks to birdie.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{once george jessel played my hometown. for a girl, gettin' in to see him was easy. gettin' out was the problem...}
<A>__{they all laugh. karen goes to the door, opens it. eve comes in. karen closes the door behind her. a moment.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i thought you'd forgotten about me.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not at all.}
<P>__{(her arm through eve's)}
<D>__{margo, this is eve harrington.}

<P>__{(musically)}
<D>__{how do you do, my dear.}

<P>__{(graciously)}
<D>__{and this is my good friend and companion, miss birdie coonan.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{oh, brother.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{miss coonan...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(to birdie)}
<D>__{oh brother what?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{when she gets like this... all of a sudden she's playin' hamlet's mother...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(quiet menace)}
<D>__{i'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, birdie dear.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{if i haven't, i will find something till you're normal.}
<A>__{she goes into the bathroom.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{dear birdie. won't you sit down, miss worthington?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{harrington.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm so sorry... harrington. won't you sit down?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she sits. a short lull.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{would you like a drink? it's right beside you...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...}
<A>__{they start together, and stop in deference to each other. they're a little flustered. but not eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<P>__{(to lloyd)}
<D>__{yes. i've seen every performance.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{every performance? then am i safe in assuming you like it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'd like anything miss channing played...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(beams)}
<D>__{would you, really? how sweet }
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{i doubt very much that you'd like her in 'the hairy ape'.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{please, don't misunderstand me, mr. richards. i think that part of miss channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for miss channing, isn't it, mr. richards?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{of course it is.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{how'd hear about it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{there was an item in the times. i like the title. 'footsteps on the ceiling'.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{let's get back to this one. have you really seen every performance?}
<P>__{(eve nods)}
<D>__{why? i'm curious...}
<A>__{eve looks at margo, then drops her eyes.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well. if i didn't come to see the play, i wouldn't have anywhere else to go.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{there are other plays...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{not with you in them. not by mr. richards...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{but you must have friends, a family, a home }
<A>__{eve pauses. then shakes her head.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{tell us about it eve...}
<A>__{eve looks at her grateful because karen called her "eve." then away, again...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{if i only knew how...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{try...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{birdie comes out of the bathroom. everybody looks at her sharply. she realizes she's in on something important. she closes the door quietly, leans against it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well... it started with the play before this one...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{'remembrance'.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{did you see it here in new york?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{san francisco. it was the last week. i went one night... the most important night in my life until this one. anyway... i found myself going the next night and the next and the nexterior every performance. then, when the show went east i went east.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i will never forget that blizzard the night we played cheyenne. a cold night. first time i ever saw a brassiere break like a piece of matzos...}
<A>__{eve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{eve... why don't you start at the beginning?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it couldn't possibly interest you.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{eve speaks simply and without self pity.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i guess it started back home. wisconsin, that is. there was just mum, and dad and me. i was the only child, and i made believe a lot when i was a kid i acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. but somehow acting and make believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that i couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... i'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't i?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{not at all...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was a farmer. i had to help out. so i quit school and i went to milwaukee. i became a secretary. in a brewery.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{when you're a secretary in a brewery it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. everything is beer. it wasn't much fun, but it helped at home and there was a little theater group... like a drop of rain in the desert. that's where i met eddie. he was a radio technician. we played 'liliom' for three performances, i was awful then the war came, and we got married. eddie was in the air force and they sent him to the south pacific. you were with the o.w.i., weren't you mr. richards?}
<P>__{(lloyd nods)}
<D>__{that's what 'who's who' says... well, with eddie gone, my life went back to beer. except for a letter a week. one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. i'd saved my money and vacation time. i went to san francisco to meet him.}
<P>__{(a slight pause)}
<D>__{eddie wasn't there. they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee the one that came from washington to say that eddie wasn't coming at all. that eddie was dead...}
<P>__{(karen puts her hand on lloyd's)}
<D>__{... so i figured i'd stay in san francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without eddie. i found a job. and his insurance helped... and there were theaters in san francisco. and one night margo channing came to play in 'remembrance'... and i went to see it. and well here i am...}
<A>__{she finishes dry eyes and self composed. margo squeezes the bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes.}
<C>__{birdie}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{what a story. everything but the bloodhounds snappin' at her rear end...}
<A>__{that breaks the spell. margo turns to her }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{there are some human experiences, birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house and that even a fifth rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{i want to apologize for birdie's }
<C>__{birdie}
<P>__{(snaps in)}
<D>__{you don't have to apologize for me!}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings. it's just my way of talkin'...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(nicely)}
<D>__{you didn't hurt my feelings, miss coonan...}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{call me birdie.}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{as for bein' fifth rate i closed the first half for eleven years an' you know it!}
<A>__{she slams into the bathroom again. at that precise instant bill sampson flings open the door to the dressing room. he's youngish, vital, undisciplined. he lugs a beat up suitcase which he drops as he crosses to margo }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{forty five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do i find you? not ready yet, looking like a junk yard }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{thank you so much.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? have you no human consideration?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{show me a human and i might have!}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(conscious of eve)}
<D>__{bill...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! i start shooting a week from monday zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{bill }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{zanuck, zanuck, zanuck! what are you two lovers?}
<A>__{bill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{only in some ways. you're prettier...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm a junk yard.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{bill!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(vaguely; to karen)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is eve harrington.}
<A>__{bill flashes a fleeting look at eve.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{my wonderful junk yard. the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{heaven help me, i love a psychotic.}
<A>__{bill grins, rises, sees eve as if for the first time.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hello, what's your name?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{eve. eve harrington.}
<C>__{karen}

<D>__{where?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{right here. a minute ago.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she, too, is a great admirer of yours.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{imagine. all this admiration in just one room.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{take your mistress into the bathroom and dress her.}
<P>__{(birdie opens her mouth)}
<D>__{without comment.}
<A>__{birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom. in a moment we hear a shower start to run. eve gets up.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not going, are you?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i think i'd better. it's been well, i can hardly find the words to say how it's been...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{no, don't go...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the four of you must have so much to say to each other with mr. sampson leaving...}

<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well if i'm not in the way...}

<A>__{lloyd gets up. karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door. she yells the shower is going...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo, good night! i will call you tomorrow!}
<A>__{margo's answer is lost in the shower noise. karen crosses to kiss bill. she's joined by lloyd.}
