<L>__{exterior sky day}
<A>__{a formation of six black bell cobra helicopters rush at us out of the blue. from above them we can see that they are heading for a small desert town. 'welcome to lathrop wells' is spelled out on a hillside in white washed stones.}
<L>__{exterior airstrip day}
<A>__{grubby, unshaven and unwashed, shermin, bell, lyman and the rest of the crew watch the seven cobras land in sequence. fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs out of the first one down and he and shermin meet in the middle of the runway.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{hello george.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{shermin...}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{what's all this for?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we have a new directive. i'm taking over.}
<C>__{shermin}
<P>__{(scans the cobras)}
<D>__{we don't have to do it that way. we can catch him this time.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{washington thinks it's too late for that.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{i've never been taken off an assignment in my life. give me twenty four hours and i will have him for you.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{you're not hearing me.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{you can change a directive, george. you've done it before. listen to me. he's going somewhere in death valley. lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop. east is the nuclear site. there are no roads in there. she was teaching him to hitchhike. i'm telling you. we block the four roads into death valley and we got him.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we'll do that. but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man. he can disappear.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{that's the chance we have to take.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{no, we don't.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{then you're going to have to do it without me.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{you're a career intelligence officer, shermin. you'll be in the air with us.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{you're talking about taking a life. the most unique life form on this planet. i think we're better than that.}
