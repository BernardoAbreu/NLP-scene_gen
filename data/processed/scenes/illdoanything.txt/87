<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i wanted to talk to her again... i...}
<A>__{she stops in mid sentence, looking at her father. he is overcome... his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life. she moves to his side. he starts to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards the bathroom, rubbing jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance. he closes the door.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{everything's okay... i'm sorry i forgot to put you back on with cathy.}
<A>__{he walks across the room, jeannie tracking him.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{you didn't cried because of that... i don't even want to talk to her.}
<A>__{matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable to keep up appearances other than a few minor half hearted tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his side. she pets him some... this goes on for several beats as the strains of "you could be wonderful" accompany the moment. then:}

<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{dad. can i say just one thing?}
<A>__{with some effort, matt lifts his head and nods permission.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{you've got to make me supper.}
<A>__{matt nods, rises and leads her into the small kitchen.}
