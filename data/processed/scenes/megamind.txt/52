<C>__{hal}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{he starts running after it. zoom he takes off like lightening.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa!}
<A>__{unable to stop, he slams into the back of the bus and falls back to the ground. as the bus continues on he sees an indentation of his torso right below the rear window. stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{something's not right here.}
<A>__{he slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{wake up! wake up, hal!}
<A>__{honk! hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him. he goes to jump out of the way zoom he flies two stories up, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk. hal sits up, disheveled and scared.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{okay, okay. let's get it together, man.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{this is just some sort of...episode. it will pass, it will pass.}
<A>__{he opens his eyes and looks down the street. a beautiful naked woman is coming toward him.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{well, not too fast i hope.}
<A>__{as she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he catches another naked woman an old disgusting one.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{yes, fast, fast!}
<A>__{he turns away from her in horror only to see an entire block of naked people going about their business. he rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. everyone has returned to a clothed state. he relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{i think i need to go home.}
