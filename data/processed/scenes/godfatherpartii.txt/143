<B>__{close view on michael}
<A>__{looking out the window. michael's pov crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: americans walking through the streets with cameras. occasionally, we see a cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat, carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers. from all of these street impressions, the city is booming with activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and pimps and little children begging in the streets.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{the big american car stops at an intersection. bussetta is sitting in the forward passenger side; while michael is in the back. he hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees four cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry. the cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away in spanish.}
