<D>__{rent! rent, more bills, rent... electricity, bills...}
<L>__{interior peter's apartment day}
<A>__{a one room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and papers. a photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses. self consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs, wind up toys, a stuffed carp. an unmade bed and a 50's dinette set are the only furniture. a grimy skylight leads to the roof. it's not a pretty place, but it has personality. a voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an intruder, is sneaking around.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{there's nothing in there worth stealing!}
<C>__{may }
<P>__{(from within the kitchen)}
<D>__{that's the understatement of the year.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i am old enough to... to make my own }
<C>__{may}
<D>__{but i didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i will introduce you.}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{oh. and those foul chemicals in the pots...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i take pictures, remember?}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{anyway, i've decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills...}
<A>__{she grabs her coat, crosses back to peter and tugs on his shoulder.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's friday night...}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{yes. do you have a date?}
