<A>__{anton stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly lit living room. he gazes at a framed family portrait vincent's face has been torn out of it. he suddenly spies vincent exiting the front gate, carrying a suitcase. anton goes to shout vincent's name but the words don't get out.}
<L>__{exterior gattaca. dawn.}
<A>__{a pick up truck, packed with a cleaning crew, pulls into the rear of the building. they are no longer strictly the migrant workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of ethnicities all members of a genetic underclass that does not discriminate by race. as vincent exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to know as jerome. the only visible differences are the glasses he wears and his hair, still naturally dark. jerome (vo)}
<D>__{like many others in my situation, i moved around a lot in the next few years, getting work where i could. i must have cleaned half the toilets in the state.}
<A>__{we follow vincent through the course of a day. cleaning restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing windows gazing at the aerospace workers below. the building is part of the gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch site. throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, vincent spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky. jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up. long after the sun has set, vincent is still working. another rocket ship lights up the darkness. vincent gazes forlornly into the heavens.}
