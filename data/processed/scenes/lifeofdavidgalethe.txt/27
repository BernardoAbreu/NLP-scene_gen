<L>__{interior ellis visitation area day}
<A>__{the door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{here we are.}
<A>__{the visitation hall has the linoleum and fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria. it is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass. across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth. every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. on the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section. just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. this is david's lawyer, benjamin belyeu (late 30's). on the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve. above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling. the center chair is in a stainless steel cage. inside sits david gale.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(calling out to belyeu)}
<D>__{all yours, mr. belyeu.}
<P>__{(to bitsey and zack)}
<D>__{you folks have safe visit now.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he exits as bitsey and zack make their way toward belyeu and david; it's a walk of about twenty five feet. belyeu's voice is a thick combination of cajun and harvard yard.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{miss bloom?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{belyeu speaks as slowly as grover did quickly. david stands up politely in his cage he's too tall and has to hunch.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{did that p.r. man validate your parkin'?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{he said the gift shop could do it.}
<A>__{belyeu laughs, smiles pure old new orleans charm.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{she's a smart one.}
<A>__{belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{benjamin belyeu, mr. gale's attorney.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{this is zack.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{pleasure.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{and this is the man of the hour.}
<A>__{they move toward david. a speaker system loudly (really loudly) interrupts:}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{sit down, gale.}
<A>__{all wince. david sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{now, why can't they turn that thing down?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to the microphone above him)}
<D>__{my lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker system volume.}
<A>__{a beat. they all look over at the guard's booth. one of the guards makes a get on with your business gesture.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they're practicing being cruel and unusual.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{mrs. bloom, i'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit.}
<A>__{belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two hour sessions. today, tomorrow and thursday, all at three in the p.m. i'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind.}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{you have my gregg book?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i need it for billy's appeal.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(to bitsey)}
<D>__{my client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook.}
<P>__{(takes out his planner)}
<D>__{now, i have some papers for which i need your jo ann hancock.}
<P>__{(handing her a business card)}
<D>__{come by my austin office at your earliest convenience. thursday mornin', say.}
<A>__{bitsey's confused. belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone. she understands, nods.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{fine, till thursday then.}
<A>__{belyeu picks up his bag. he and zack start the hike to the door. belyeu turns, walks backwards.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{good luck, miss bloom.}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{i will come by later. we can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'.}
<A>__{david waves "get lost." belyeu turns.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{bye, ya' all.}
<A>__{they watch him walk away. bitsey turns to david. he's looking at the floor, caught in a thought.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{so...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sorry. have a seat.}
<A>__{she does so. david smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{he's a character.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah, known benny most my life. met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. we called it playing 'execution.'}
<A>__{david looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air. uncomfortable, bitsey starts to look in her purse.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{since i grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family i have.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{where's your ex wife?}
<A>__{bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we agreed minimal contact would be easier. please don't mention her, or my son.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{all right. anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' i will take it to my grave. but then you know that about me. otherwise i wouldn't be here.}
<A>__{david smiles, nods.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(referring to the pen)}
<D>__{is this recording equipment?}
<A>__{he shrugs.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how should we start?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i'd say you're a man with a story to tell, mr. gale. you chose the magazine, the format. you chose me.}
<A>__{she sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{david looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.}
