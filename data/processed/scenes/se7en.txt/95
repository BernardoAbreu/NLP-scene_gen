<A>__{the streets are full of patrol cars. cops and forensics enter and exit the church from various doorways. saw horses are loaded off a flat bed truck as a police barricade is erected.}
<L>__{interior abandoned church late afternoon}
<A>__{much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking for any sign that someone's been here recently. small temporary floodlights are hoisted on tripods. two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders. flash photo after flash photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau. near the open church doors, mills speaks with great animation, holding his ream of computer paper. somerset looks at the altar and the tableau, preoccupied.}

<D>__{our guy's a bookworm, right? and, i know it's a long shot, but you have to give a picture id and current phone bill to get a library card. hey...}
<A>__{mills snaps his fingers in somerset's face, gets his attention.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{i made two separate lists of books. one relating to the sins... dante's purgatory, canterbury tales... the dictionary of catholicism... all the religious stuff. the second list was books about torture methods, mass murderers... sadomasochism. whatever our killer might study to do the things he's done. whatever his other interests are.}
<A>__{somerset takes the computer list.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{so, what is this?}

<C>__{mills }
<D>__{let's say you take, dante's purgatory, call number eight five one d, and... the biography of the marquis de sade, ninety two s a d e. put those books in the system, and the computer can give you the name of anyone who's ever taken out both those books. and, it doesn't just give you their name and address, it gives you a complete history of their library reading habits.}
<A>__{mills slaps the list in somerset's hand.}
<C>__{mills }

<D>__{if somebody's out there reading paradise lost and studying the life and times of charlie manson, i want to talk to them.}
<A>__{somerset looks up from the list, warming to it. he starts looking around, searching for someone.}
