<L>__{exterior gabriel's house pool night}
<A>__{the house is at the very top of the hills and the pool hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house. the outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs frozen in air. a very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress. more ibiza than hollywood hills. stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half dozen beautiful un clad model types. gabriel is mingling through the crowd. closeup stanley stanley stares off into the glittering lights of l.a.}

<D>__{so stan, tell me. how'd you do it?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{break the code. at the club. you broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. how?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i used a logic bomb, dropped it through the trap door }
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{no, you didn't. you didn't have time.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{c'mon, you can do better than that. how'd you do it?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i used a password sniffer.}
<A>__{gabriel glances at ginger who shakes her head.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{yes, i did }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{c'mon, stanley. how'd you do it?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i don't know exactly. i see the numbers. in my head. all my life. i don't answer equations, i just see the answers. same with code. i can't explain }
<A>__{ginger eases over to where stan is sitting. she runs her hands across his shoulders as she moves around him, dancing to the music.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{mozart always said he didn't write music; he just wrote down what he heard in his head. so did faulkner, just with words.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(drinking wine)}
<D>__{you definitely have a gift, stan. the most powerful people on the planet are like you. with a laptop and a phone line you can make god look like a thirteen year old with a stack of playboys and a lack of imagination.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{c'mere, stan, let me show you something.}
