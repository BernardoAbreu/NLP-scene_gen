<L>__{73 villa headquarters. inside. day.}
<A>__{in a villa in the military headquarters, a reception room is visible through a large window on the first floor. there are about twenty officers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture. mathieu is in front of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk. at his back there is a blackboard, and near it, a large map with pyramid graphs, cells, arrows, crossmarks, and, above them, the title:}
<B>__{structure nlf autonomous zone of algiers.}
<A>__{mathieu's voice has nothing of the military and traditional. his tone is neither harsh nor cold, but rather kind and pleasing; from it emanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the result is that in the last two months, they have reached an average of 4.2 assaults per day, including aggression against individuals, and the explosions. of course, the conditions of the problem are as usual: first, the adversary; second, the method to destroy him ... there are 80,000 arabs in the casbah. are they all against us? we know they are not. in reality, it is only a small minority that dominates with terror and violence. this minority is our adversary and we must isolate and destroy it ...}
<A>__{while speaking, he goes to the window, and pulls down the shade. he interrupts his speech, points to the rest of the window:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{draw it down there too ...}
<A>__{two or three officers stand up to perform the task. at the back of the room there is a movie projector. next to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it. the other shades are drawn, and gradually the room is darkened. mathieu, meanwhile, has resumed speaking:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{he is an adversary who shifts his position above and below the surface with highly commendable revolutionary methods and original tactics. ... he is an anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who mingles with thousands of others who resemble him. we find him everywhere: in the alleys of the casbah; in the streets of the european city, and in working places.}
<A>__{mathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the room which is completely darkened.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{go ahead, martin.}
<A>__{martin turns on the projector. on the white wall next to the map and graph appear pictures of the casbah. there are the blockades, the barbed wire, the metal screens, the algerians who exit and enter, the policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. from time to time, close ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the minutest details, close ups of faces, motionless images that last only for a few seconds.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{here is some film taken by the police. the cameras were hidden at the casbah exits. they thought these films might be useful, and in fact they are useful in demonstrating the usefulness of certain methods. or, at least, their inadequacy.}
<A>__{hassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her, while she laughs, jokes, flirts in a provocative manner, and passes the blockade.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{i chose these films because they were shot in the hours preceding some recent terroristic assaults. and so, among all these arabs, men and women, there are the ones responsible. but which ones are they? how can we recognize them? controlling documents is ridiculous: one who has everything in order is most likely to be the terrorist.}
<A>__{an algerian is being dragged away while protesting, kicking, and trying to free himself. and then the scene changes. there is another casbah exit, and an algerian who is being searched.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{note the intuition of the cameraman. he realized that in that box, there had to be something of interest, and he paused to focus it.}
<A>__{the picture is enlarged. the small box which the algerian is carrying on his shoulder is seen in detail. it is opened. the box is swarming with snakes; the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward. the officers in the room burst into laughter.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in a double bottom. who knows? we'll never know.}
<A>__{using the barrel of his machine gun, a soldier has closed the box. a snake has managed to jump out, and fallen to the ground. the people are terrified and move away. others laugh, among them, petit omar, who seems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{that's enough, martin ...}
<A>__{the lights are again switched on in the room. mathieu is again next to the desk, and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{we must start again from scratch. the only information that we have concerns the structure of the organization. and we shall begin from that ...}
<A>__{he takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the graph, while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university professor.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{it is a pyramid like organization divided into a series of sectors. at the top of the pyramid is their general staff.}
<A>__{he has moved near the blackboard, and taken some chalk, and slowly as he speaks, he illustrates his speech.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the military commander responsible for the executive body finds the right man and nominates him to responsibility for a sector: number one. number one in his turn, chooses another two: number two and number three ... and so they form the first triangle.}
<A>__{he has written high on the board a number one and below it, with some space between them, the numbers two and three. he unites the three numbers with lines and forms a triangle.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{now number two and number three choose, in their turn, two men each ... number four and five, and so on ...}
<A>__{mathieu writes the new numbers, spacing them on the next line. then he unites two to four and five, and three to six and seven, forming two new triangles. mathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the preceding line and thus forms other triangles. now the blackboard is covered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the reason for this geometry is so that every militant will know only three members in the entire organization: his commander who has chosen him, and the two members that he himself has chosen ... contacts take place only by written instructions ... that is why we do not know our adversaries: because, in practice, they do not even know each other.}
<A>__{mathieu leaves the blackboard and moves near the officers. the tone of his voice changes. the explanation is now finished. he gives directions ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{to know them means to eliminate them. consequently, the military aspect is secondary to the police method. i know we are not fond of this word, but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform. we must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. the reason for this work is information. the method is interrogation. and interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. in practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. i am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. however, success does not depend solely on us. we need to have the casbah at our disposal. we must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. and here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. we have requested a carte blanche. but it is very difficult to obtain. therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible. it is necessary to create it ourselves this excuse. unless our adversaries will think of it themselves, which seems to be what they are doing.}
