<A>__{simms talks with a maid.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry. when you're cleaning those bathrooms, what you do, you pick up the towel, you give it a good shake and a good look, and you say to yourself, 'would i dry myself on this towel?' if the answer's yes, fold it.}
<A>__{roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward simms.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{what if it's wet?}

<C>__{simms}
<D>__{we never know when and we never know why. we never know how. the only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. just when you've got tickets to the world series. and that's the way the permanent waves.}

<D>__{that fellow could be a congressman.}
<P>__{(turns to maid)}
