<A>__{we see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring it to c.w. he accepts it. a man rolls a cigarette and lights it. then, very gingerly, as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the window and places it in clyde's lips. it hangs there, clyde unable to drag on it or remove it. children peer through the back window. c.w. finishes his cup of soup. he hands it and the cup of water back to a woman in the crowd. quietly, moving together, the okies step back. c.w. walks to the driver's seat, gets in and shuts the door. he starts up the car. the people push a bit closer for a last look. clyde, unable to do more, nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by way of saying "thank you" t ot the people. the cigarette is still dangling from his lips. the car moves off. a young boy pulls on his father's shirt.}
