<A>__{he takes off his medallion and places it around her neck. suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her towards him. his eyes change to a bright green as he forces her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes. as he molests her, taarna is distracted. she hears something voices inside her, chanting her name. quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart. then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's ears. as he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground. still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet. she then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock, next to the growling creature. as taarna flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily.}
