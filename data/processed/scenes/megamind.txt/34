<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{plato, the radioactive spider, please.}
<A>__{plato throws the switch dropping a single spider onto stenwick's arm. stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.}
<C>__{stenwick}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{he brushes the spider off.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{anything, stenwick?}
<C>__{stenwick}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{no. ah...sir, i didn't know this was about spiders. i have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia.}
<A>__{master mind thinks for a moment, then turns to plato.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{we're gonna need more venom.}
<A>__{plato throws another switch, this time dumping thousands of spiders on poor stenwick. his screams begin to fade as he's engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.}
<C>__{master mind }
