<L>__{interior northern and western tunnels continuous}
<A>__{we hear gunfire and screams coming from all directions. blade retreats. a reaper, fully on fire from the uv explosion, races towards him. as blade decapitates it:}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(shouting into radio)}
<D>__{re group! re group!}
<A>__{asad and nyssa also retreat. nyssa pulls a pin on a uv flashbang, throws it behind her. ba bang! uv light fills the tunnels and }
<L>__{interior sewer line four way intersection day}
<A>__{blade, nyssa, whistler and asad abruptly find themselves back in the four way juncture, knee deep in water. they quickly regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{where's chupa?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{forget him, he's chunk style.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{same with snowman and verlaine.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{guess that perfume of yours did the trick after all?}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{a little too well, i'd say.}
<A>__{the others turn to look in blade's direction.}
<B>__{dozens of red eyes}
<A>__{are staring out at them from the darkness of the eastern tunnel. then we hear a hissing sound coming from the opposite direction. blade and the others spin around more red eyed reapers are closing in on them from the west. and the north. and the south! there must be forty of them in all.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{perfect. we got the whole fucking partridge family here.}
<A>__{they retreat until they are back to back, each one of them covering their respective tunnel opening.}
<B>__{a reaper}
<A>__{lunges at them from the north. asad triggers his uv laser, scorching the creature. it howls and slinks backwards.}
<B>__{two more reapers}
<A>__{attack from the east and the west. blade and nyssa respond in kind, burning their assailants in mid air. but even as they fire, their uv beams weaken, the flashes of light coming from their barrels pulsing less frequently.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{unless anybody has any bright ideas, i'd say we're about half a battery away from a reaper gang bang.}
<A>__{the foursome are managing to keep the reapers at bay, but just barely. blade motions to nyssa.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{give me the rest of the pheromones.}
<A>__{nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing blade the remaining atomizers. he crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid within spill over his face and chest.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{the reapers become even more agitated, hissing loudly, pressing in on them closer and closer. blade nods his head back down the western tunnel.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{verlaine's body is back there somewhere with the uv bomb. if you train your guns in that direction, you'll drive an opening in their ranks. i will run for it. when the reapers come after me, you make a break for it the other way.}
<A>__{asad studies blade with newfound respect.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{you won't make it.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(hefting his uv gun)}
<D>__{then i will die trying, won't i?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{blade.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{save it. i don't want to hear your words. let's do this now!!!}
<A>__{the foursome spin, firing their uv lasers down the western tunnel. the reapers shriek, falling to either side, their bodies burning blade charges forward, firing his dying uv laser. as he makes it past the line of reapers, they start after him, driven into a frenzy by the pheromones. the reapers in the northern and eastern tunnels flood after blade too, leaving nyssa, whistler and asad to contend with the reapers in the southern tunnel. they discharge their weapons, shouldering reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.}
