<L>__{exterior quarry continuous}
<A>__{we see the massive quarry hundreds of feet deep and tilt up to the corvette and cop speeding toward it }
<L>__{interior corvette moving continuous}
<A>__{kirk, eyes intense, almost suicidal this is where he's been headed all along and for a moment we think holy shit this is how james kirk dies. he speeds toward the edge closer closer but at the last second, kirk slams the brake the car skids pivots and he leaps from the car, which sails sideways off the cliff edge falling... falling... the cop comes to quick a stop in clouds of dust as the corvette explodes on the quarry floor the angry cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as jim kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{what's your name, son?}
<A>__{and as he stands, we push in on him low and wide damn if that kid doesn't have a swagger. it's like the first time he's ever stood in his life.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{my name's kirk. james tiberius kirk.}
<A>__{and as our music builds we cut to: constant shocks of light as an alien prisoner intelligent, bi pedal, but with four terrified eyes is slammed down onto the wet pavement a choke stick shoved under his chin then: voices. brutal, guttural klingon }
<C>__{klingon guard }
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{you say they are not yours...}
<A>__{whip pan to see the scary klingon guards four of them standing above the alien chilling masks hide their hideous faces and one holds a fluorescent set of pages }
<C>__{klingon guard }
<D>__{... these federation maps we found in your pockets.}
<A>__{and the alien speaks an unknown language all eyes wild:}
<C>__{alien}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{i speak the truth. i do.}
<C>__{klingon guard}
<D>__{then who are they for?}
<A>__{but the alien just shakes his head, afraid he will not talk. so they grab him and yank him upward }
<C>__{klingon guard }
<D>__{you would rather die then tell us?}
<A>__{push in tight as the alien finally whispers, terrified:}
<C>__{alien}
<D>__{... nero!!!}
<A>__{and the guards look at each other... seemingly with concern... moments later eight guards walk together and we pan with them to reveal the horrifying expanse that is the klingon prison yard. we realize that the constant shocks of light was lightning, that apparently never stops here. a super reads: "rura penthe klingon prison asteroid". and we see they're heading for a muscular figure, using a sledge hammer, splitting rocks, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. boom up to find that it's nero. and he stops, sensing the coming guards. and he manages a small smile. and he quickly turns to them they all stop, suddenly. afraid of him. one of them tosses nero a set of manacles. nero picks them up. puts them on. and offers his cuffed hands, willingly.}
