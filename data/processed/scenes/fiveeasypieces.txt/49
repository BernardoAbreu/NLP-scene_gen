<A>__{the car that held the two men is parked next to it, and both men are on the rig platform moving toward elton. he backs away from them, breaks toward the rig tour and starts to climb it. one of the men catches hold of his leg and yanks him back. elton pulls loose from him, jumps to the ground and begins running with both men in pursuit.}

<D>__{hey! what's goin' on?!}
<A>__{he starts sprinting back to the rig. the first man has a hold on elton and is struggling to subdue him. he is joined by the second man, and as they force his arms behind his back and cuff his wrists... ... bobby moves into frame, grabbing onto the first man and wrestling him away from elton.}
<C>__{elton}
<D>__{don't do that, bob!! it's the law!}

<D>__{it's the law, bob, don't mix in!}
<A>__{the second man pushes elton aside and as bobby throws a punch at him...}

<D>__{look out behind!}
<A>__{... the other grabs him from behind, holding him, while the second man jams a fist into his stomach and, as he doubles over, follows with a violent chop to the back of his neck. bobby slumps to the ground, and as the first man puts a knee into his back and prepares to handcuff him:}
<C>__{elton }
<D>__{hey, don't do that. don't you think you could just leave him...}
<A>__{the second man takes hold of elton and starts to move him off.}
<C>__{elton}
