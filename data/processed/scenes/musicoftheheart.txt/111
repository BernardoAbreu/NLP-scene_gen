<D>__{there's gotta be a way to fight this!}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{fight it with what? i don't have any other extra programs to give them instead.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{oh, i see. so after ten years, after fourteen hundred children have learned to play the violin, this is just an "extra program."}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you know i don't feel that way and you know damn well i've been standing by you all these years! you think i haven't noticed what you've done for these kids?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{then do something!}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(points to her phone)}
<D>__{i've been on this phone for the past three days trying to "do something" the district office can't even stand the sound of my voice. believe me, there are some people around here i'd much rather get rid of. but as far as the board's concerned, violin classes are not a priority.}
<A>__{roberta's fury starts to give way to grief. she looks terribly wounded. janet looks at her helplessly.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{i don't have the power here, roberta. i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{a beat, and roberta exits.}
