<L>__{interior betty's house den night}
<A>__{betty is glued to the tv, oblivious to the men. chloe and david are still talking in his car. she continues to cry.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{you're wonderful, chloe, you are... but i just know there's something special out there for me.}
<L>__{interior betty's house dining room night}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{now i'm gonna tell you what stupid is. stupid is taking something that doesn't belong to you. right wesley?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{that is so right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. right wesley?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{now, that's really stupid.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. don't we?}
<A>__{del nods; crying, sweating.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{good. now we're getting somewhere. you agree that you were stupid?}
<A>__{del nods again. wesley collects charlie's glass and mixes him another drink. he gets a beer for himself and stands behind del. charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{you know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about native americans. right here where your house is you'd have been scalped.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{hell of a way to die.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it wasn't always fatal, wesley. we could scalp del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.}
<A>__{del's eyes get huge.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{it's pretty simple, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{first you take a knife and just draw a mark right across the hairline.}
<A>__{wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the very top of del's forehead. trickles of blood wind their way down his brow. del is moaning and panting through his socks.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{hold still, del, we're just talking here...}
<P>__{(pointing to a spot)}
<D>__{then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. it's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{a mark, huh?}
<A>__{wesley takes a jab at del's forehead with his knife, leaving a small cut. del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as wesley grabs a fistful of his hair.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{shut the fuck up! i bleed more than that when i shave...}
<A>__{del stops moving. he breathes furiously through his nostrils.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{now. i want to know the particulars of your stupid act: how you got what doesn't belong to you, who helped you get it, and of course, where it is now.}
<A>__{charlie pulls the socks out of del's mouth. del splutters, gasping for air.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{it's in the buick! i swear to god it's all there!}
