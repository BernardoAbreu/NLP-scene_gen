<T>__{open on:}
<L>__{exterior total entertainment set day}
<A>__{gale weathers, the flashy thirty something news anchor and author of the woodsboro murders. she sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for total entertainment, an et style program with a live studio audience.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{good morning hollywood. and today officially starts the summer movie season. opening the box office this week is jeff bridges and tim robins in arlington street, eugene levy and jason biggs in american pastry, and tori spelling and david schwimmer in stab 2, based off my best selling book the windsor murders.}
<A>__{camera pans across the audience. many of them are dressed as the ghost. a sea of white screaming faces. very eerie and unsettling.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{well i see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. today we have director of the upcoming stab 3: return to woodsboro, roman bridger. why don't we give mr. bridger a nice welcome to the set of total entertainment.}
<A>__{the crowd goes wild with applause and faux knife slashes as roman bridger, ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy white suit. he sits down on a chair beside gale's desk, places a stab 3 coffee mug beside gale's hand.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{good morning gale. pleasure to be here.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it's a pleasure to finally meet you, roman.}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(addressing audience)}
<D>__{well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp, or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy, have no fear, roman is here. aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{honestly though,}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{honestly, my life.}
<A>__{a eclectic hush falls over the crowd. roman appears somewhat sinister in this light. gale gazes deeply into roman's eyes.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{your life?}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick.}
<A>__{roman smiles. the true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half open exit door. now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade. a loud buzzing o.s. gale is startled out of her skin. she looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. the word "commercial break" is illuminated in flashing red light. gale sighs, looks back to the exit. the ghost is gone. she turns to roman.}

<D>__{would you excuse me for a moment?}

<D>__{sure.}
