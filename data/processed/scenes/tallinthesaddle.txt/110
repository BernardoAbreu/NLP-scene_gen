<L>__{interior garvey's office day}
<A>__{close shot a letter written in a bold feminine hand. it reads: dear mr. garvey: in answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that my niece, clara caldwell, became of age january 11th of this year. and, although i am no longer her legal guardian, it behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest in her affairs the camera holds long enough for the letter to be read. and now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the camera pulls back showing the burning letter in judge garvey's hand. he is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and miss martin is close to him watching the letter burn. garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove. he lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and smiles to miss martin.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{that takes care of that }
<P>__{(crosses to his desk)}
<D>__{now, i will draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(not too enthusiastic)}
<D>__{i certainly hope so it's not myself i'm concerned about }
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(getting out the papers)}
<D>__{ of course not.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{i can't say i'm very happy about doing this i only hope it works out for the best.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{it's the better choice of two evils now let's see }
<P>__{(begins to write)}
<D>__{i, elizabeth }
<P>__{(looks at miss martin)}
<D>__{it is elizabeth, isn't it?}
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{yes }
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{ elizabeth martin, of danvers, massachusetts, do hereby }
<A>__{the door opens and rocklin enters. miss martin, who has been pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. garvey, taken completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. rocklin eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(leaning back in his chair)}
<D>__{well, mr. rocklin, this is indeed a surprise. didn't expect to see you so soon. i understood you were riding for the santee.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{it is quite obvious to garvey that rocklin is here on business. he turns to miss martin.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(to miss martin)}
<D>__{perhaps you'd better come back later }
<A>__{miss martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after giving rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the door. garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to his desk.}
