<L>__{int pigskin sports bar day}
<A>__{if depression had a home, this is it. several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit around the bar. a couple hapless guys play pool. one throws darts. ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{excuse me, guy?! my name is ace ventura, i'm a pet detective. i'd like to ask you a few questions if}
<A>__{i could. no one even looks at him.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{just a few questions, that's all.}
<A>__{still no one reacts.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(very up)}
<D>__{who wants gum?!}
<A>__{again, no reaction. ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i'm looking for a guy who used to work here.}
<A>__{the bartender takes the money.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{that right?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{he was a kicker for the dolphins. ray finkle.}
<A>__{a pool ball flies by ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. all eyes are on ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to guy who threw it)}
<D>__{that would be a scratch.}
<C>__{toothless giant}
<D>__{you a friend of finkle's?}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{…yes?}
<A>__{crash! the giant guy smashes his bottle.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{sorry, i have "say the opposite of what you mean" disease.}
<A>__{several undesirables surround ace.}
<C>__{toothless giant}
<D>__{that bastard ruined this town.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{ewww… i hate that! hick #2 we bet everything we had on that super bowl and that son of a bitch gagged.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{what a diiick!}
<A>__{they all move closer in a threatening manner.}
<D>__{hick #3 shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{death to finkle! death to finkle!}
<A>__{the bartender steps in.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{we had a hell of a thing going here. tourists coming to see ray finkle's home town. he was standing right over there when he got the call from the dolphins.}
<A>__{the bartender points to a payphone. it has had the shit beaten out of it. every expletive you can think of is graffitied around it.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{did he come back after the super bowl?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{yeah… but the boys here had ways of letting him know he wasn't welcome. hick #1 excuse me, i gotta take a wicked finkle.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{toothless giant}
<D>__{what's the difference between finkle and a jackass? a jackass can kick.}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<D>__{hick #2 why did finkle cross the road?!}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(facetious)}
<D>__{wait… i know this one. hick #2 he didn't! and i've got the hair on my bumper to prove it!}
<A>__{maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.}
<C>__{mob}
<D>__{finkle sucks! finkle sucks! finkle sucks!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{it's good you're dealing with the anger.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't suppose anyone's seen him lately?}
<A>__{the chanting stops and the guys all look at ace.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{no… but we know where his parents live! don't we boys?! hick #1 yeah! we sure do!}
<A>__{they all laugh insanely again.}
