<L>__{interior police car later that night}
<A>__{ronnie and detective harrison sit in the parked car. they're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town. lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, so then i basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit. not allowed. the two ped exits are to be used only }
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{you see that corner there, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i see it.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{that corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town. it was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence. it was nicknamed 'the crossroads.'}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{shit, i've heard of that.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{that's right, but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldn't have to worry about being safe. yes, sir, that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i don't know. it looks pretty shitty to me.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{well, it's a low income area, ronnie. you're being kind of prejudiced.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, yeah, i can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{that's right, but it hasn't been easy. we still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i use that same technique at the mall.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm sure. i usually do the foot patrols myself, but because i like you, i'm going to let you do it tonight.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{yeah, really. but i told you about department policy, so i'm going to need you to keep quiet about this one.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you can count on me. thank you for the honor.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{of course, ronnie. i just really believe in you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i won't let you down.}
<A>__{ronnie opens the door and gets out of the car. as he exits, a car drives by blaring rap music. the passenger throws a beer bottle at ronnie. he dodges it and the bottle shatters on the ground. ronnie is shaken, but he waves to detective harrison like he's okay. detective harrison waves back, then peels out of there. ronnie is confused.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{where are you going?!}
<A>__{detective harrison keeps on driving without looking back.}
