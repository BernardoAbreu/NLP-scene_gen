<A>__{kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{i almost believed you myself.}
<A>__{travers smiles and turns, looking at}
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{trembling with fury and grief, bent over frank's body as the last trace of vapor his breath trails from his lips. he's gone. hal gently closes the eyes of his friend.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{goodbye, frank.}
<A>__{travers moves up behind hal and kicks him.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{time for number three. unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<A>__{travers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i think i will wait here. you just murdered three of my friends. sooner or later, whoever's chasing you is going to show up and return the favor, and i'd love to watch.}
<A>__{travers puts his gun at hal's forehead and shrugs.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{suit yourself. you see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government one of whose members i know has zero imagination and i can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, you're taking us where we want to go. because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch. you want to kill me more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance.}
<P>__{(tightens trigger)}
<D>__{am i right?}
<A>__{hal's answer is a stony, loathing stare. he gets up. but insert hal's hand we can see hal has palmed something from frank's body.}
