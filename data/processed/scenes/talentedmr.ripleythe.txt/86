<L>__{interior ripley's apartment. afternoon.}
<A>__{ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas. there's a small christmas tree. he kneels on the floor with some festive, gift wrapped packages. he opens a package. it's a marble head of hadrian. a gasp from ripley. he picks up a glass, pours himself a drink.}
<L>__{interior ripley's apartment. late afternoon.}
<A>__{ripley plunges into bach's italian concerto on his new and precious toy, a steinway grand. his doorbell rings. he stops playing. he doesn't get visitors. he rises, a little nervous.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{freddie (o s)}
<D>__{dickie?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{who is it?}
<P>__{freddie (o s)}
<D>__{it's freddie. let me in.}
<A>__{ripley almost collapses. he's fainterior}
<P>__{freddie (o s)}
<D>__{dickie, come on, it's me.}
<A>__{ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. he opens the door.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hello, freddie, it's tom, tom ripley.}
<C>__{freddie}
<P>__{(confused, not pleasantly)}
<D>__{oh hello, where's dickie? how are you?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yes, i'm good, thank you. dickies at dinner. he's at otello's. do you know it?}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{i don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you. incredible. the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{the landlady as far as i could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{he's gone to dinner! search the place. i can't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{because he's been hiding from me what happened at christmas?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what about christmas?}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{he was supposed to come skiing. i didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.}
<A>__{ripley has his hands behind his back. he's tugging frantically at dickie's rings. ripley wanders into the kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.}
<P>__{ripley (o s)}
<D>__{of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? i think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{which is horseshit. have you heard him play that thing?}
<P>__{(gesturing at the sax on its stand)}
<D>__{he can't.}
<P>__{ripley (o s) (casually)}
<D>__{how did you find him? it's such an out of the way apartment. can i fix you a drink?}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<P>__{(explaining his detective work)}
<D>__{some kid at the american express office.}
<P>__{(he starts to explore)}
<D>__{are you living here?}
<A>__{now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie woogie on the piano.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(returning, flinching)}
<D>__{no. no, i'm staying here for a few days, in rome. that's a new piano, so you prob }
<P>__{freddie (o s)}
<D>__{did this place come furnished? it doesn't look like dickie. horrible isn't it? so bourgeois.}
<A>__{now he's poking at the hadrian bust.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you should watch that!}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hardly.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{have you done something to your hair?}
<A>__{ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{freddie, do you have something to say?}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{what? i think i'm saying it. something's going on. he's either converted to christianity or to something else.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i suggest you ask dickie that yourself. otello's is on delle croce, just off the corso.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{is it on "delle croce, just off the corso" ? you're a quick study, aren't you? last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. that's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. i will see you.}
<A>__{and he's gone. ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner on the table where freddie's hand had rucked it. he goes back to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.}
