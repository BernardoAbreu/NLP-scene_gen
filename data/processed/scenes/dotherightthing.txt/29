<A>__{close up johnny pump pow! a powerful gush of water flies out right at the camera. ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street. this attracts all the people of the block. it's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat. angle cee and punchy they both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk. angle ella she stands with caution away from the fire hydrant. ella does not want to get wet. angle cee and punchy they're still scraping away. angle street folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play. angle cee and punchy both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump. punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water. the can now directs the water into giant streams. angle ella ahmad sneaks up behind ella and picks her up. she's kicking and screaming furiously.}
