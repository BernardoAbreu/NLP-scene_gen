<L>__{exterior power plant day (late afternoon)}
<A>__{the power plant is an extensive, brutal, dante's inferno of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys, huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... it is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. in the murk can be seen sinister looking figures in protective clothing and hard hats. this is the world which is now entered by jill's lorry ... the lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and jill jumps down from the cab. sam stays inside, looking around. something catches his eye.}
