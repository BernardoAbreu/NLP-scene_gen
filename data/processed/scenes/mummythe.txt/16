<L>__{exterior giza port day}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<A>__{our old traitorous friend beni.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{it is three days down the nile, then two days by camel, sahibs.}
<A>__{we crane back: to reveal beni standing on the bow of a passenger barge. surrounded by daniels, henderson and burns.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{for all the money we're paying you, something better god damned well be under that sand.}
<A>__{we keep craning back: as henderson slaps daniels on the back.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{"hamunaptra," daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, "hamunaptra."}
<A>__{now we see all of giza port: team of explorers swarm the docks. across the nile, the pyramids spike the sky. evelyn and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{do you really think he'll show up?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{undoubtedly, i know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{personally, i think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. i don't like him one bit.}
<C>__{o'connell }
<D>__{anyone i know?}
<A>__{they both turn. o'connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. he looks more dashing and handsome than ever. evelyn is suitably impressed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh... um,... hello.}
<A>__{jonathan grabs o'connell's arm and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{smashing day for the start of an adventure, eh, o'connell?}
<A>__{o'connell quickly checks his pockets.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{yeah, sure, smashing.}
<A>__{he finds his wallet and relaxes. directly above him: on the bow of the barge, burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{you're sure hamunaptra is out there?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib.}
<A>__{and that's when beni spots o'connell. beni shakes his head, as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{a thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there is much work to be done.}
<A>__{beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold. back down with: evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mister o'connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam? because if it is, i'm warning you }
<A>__{o'connell steps up close to evelyn, invading her space looks her straight in the eye. evelyn doesn't back away.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{all i can tell you, miss, is that my colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway across libya and into egypt to find that city. like i told ya, all i saw was sand. everybody else was wiped out by tuareg warriors. i will take your bags.}
<A>__{o'connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on. evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. jonathan sees it.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all.}
<A>__{evelyn gives him a look. jonathan just grins. and that's when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{a bright good morning to all.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.}
<A>__{and up the plank he goes. evelyn and jonathan share a look. we go wide again: as the barge pulls out and heads down the nile. we tilt up: to the sun, which then dissolves into }
