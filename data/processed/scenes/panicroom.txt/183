<A>__{meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a library. there is a window that looks out over the sidewalk, one floor up, same level as the stoop. she looks up, into the corners of the room.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no camera, no camera, no camera...}
<A>__{they're bare, no video cameras. good. she goes to the window, tries to open it. screwed shut, of course.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{the safe is almost cracked. raoul is watching the monitors carefully. on the monitors, we see meg as she searches through the tools in the living room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer. in the panic room, raoul furrows his brow. now what?}
