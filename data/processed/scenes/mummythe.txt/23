<D>__{americans.}
<A>__{hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, now a flaming torch. jonathan turns around, hook grabs him by the throat with his flaming arm and pins him to the cabin wall. jonathan's eyes widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the flames about to strike him. the americans pivot and open fire. blows hook over the railing. jonathan turns to the americans and smiles.}

<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i can't believe the price of these fleabags.}

<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{then again...}
<A>__{sahara desert sand dunes day o'connell, evelyn, jonathan and the warden are on camels in the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked sahara.}

<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{yeah, disgusting.}
<A>__{evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.}

<A>__{we do several time dissolves: showing the majesty of the desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it. frying pan night the moon shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking across the vast wasteland. jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the rhythm of his camel. on the camel next to him, the warden snores loudly. up in front of them, evelyn slowly starts to slide off her saddle. o'connell reaches over and stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking her. for a long moment, his eyes watch evelyn, and then he looks up at a distant ridge where ardeth ray and a group of mumia riders are pacing them.}
