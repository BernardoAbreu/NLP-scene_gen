<ACTION>__{Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking. CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized. CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar. Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks. CLOSE SHOT -- BODY It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more. TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.}

FOCUS CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, black and ugly in the sunlight. REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard. VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils. MED. SHOT -- REGGIE Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin. After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

<ACTION>__{The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line. Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using their hands. (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co- ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English). VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME Some of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, hilarious. TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber the game but increase his worldly experience. The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after it. CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE She is enjoying it thoroughly. TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, PETER makes a last valiant effort and voila, grips the orange under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his TEAM.

REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in BARTHOLOMEW's photo.
