<A>__{a limousine pulling up in front of the ed sullivan marquee. the sidewalk is mobbed with fans, mostly young girls.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{oh moon of alabama we now must say goodbye we've lost our good ol mama we must have whiskey oh you know why}
<L>__{interior limo night}
<A>__{jim looking out at the mob with the other doors and pamela. the look on his face is ironic. his pov the young girls' faces, arms grasping at the windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces deformed by silent screams (we hear faint strangled shrieks below the song)... police and security pressing them back, linking arms to clear a path for the doors.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{show me the way to the next little girl oh don't ask why oh don't ask why the girls crying hysterically as jim lazily, leopardly, moves across the crowd, almost like oswald waiting for the ruby bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark glasses concealing...}

<D>__{oh jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, i looove youuuuu, jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase, jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take a picture jim?... jim, jim, oh please look at me jim!!}
<A>__{their voices distorting. a girlchild squeezing thru the cordon with the fatal bullet. in slightly slow motion, jim seeing her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. it takes two cops to peel her off. pamela furious. jim is gracious with everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a picture, seems to like it.}

<A>__{for if we don't find the next little girl i tell you we must die i tell you i tell you i tell you we must die}
