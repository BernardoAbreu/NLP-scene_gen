<L>__{81. sick bay}
<A>__{stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick of a lantern when jack arrives beside him}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{what's the butchers bill?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{six dead, thirteen wounded.}
<A>__{he notices the gash on jack's forehead}
<D>__{your head ...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(brushes him away)}
<D>__{later.}
<A>__{stephen raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained men close packed in the gloom. together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some struggling to breathe, some barely alive. jack clasps hands, whispers encouragement. a bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked with blood and deeply unconscious.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{who's this joe plaice?}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{a severe depressed fracture of the skull. i am not sure he will see out the night.}
<A>__{moving on to another barely recognizable face: young blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and the blood loss.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mr. blakeney?}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{just a broken arm, sir.}
<A>__{jack looks at stephen, whose expression is grim, but he says nothing, steering jack forward to the foot of the ladder where they can speak more privately}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i will do everything possible. i know you were close to his father.}
<A>__{jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go. stephen puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{one moment jack let me look at that brow of yours.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{its a scratch.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i will tell you if its a scratch or not. sit down.}
<A>__{jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while stephen puts a bandage round his forehead}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how did he find us stephen? seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position. its uncanny. he really is a phantom}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{unless she was alerted to our presence, and looking for us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tosh. how could that be?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the french have their spies, in britain as elsewhere.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you're saying there are traitors in the admiralty?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us. he is working for napoleon himself, with access to all that tyrant commands, overtly and covertly. so do not let defeat weigh too heavily upon you.}
