<ACTION>__{Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.  We hear faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music from waterfront bars.  One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt. Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.  His face floods with relief.}

<ACTION>__{Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his movements jerky with panic.  As he continues searching, the camera moves past him, into the darkness of the hold.  We hear Whittlesley mumbling between low, ragged breaths.  At the back of the boat the camera finds... A STACK OF CRATES... clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.  Move in on these as... The CRATES VIBRATE.  The boat has started to move! Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.}

<ACTION>__{Too late.  He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air. A look of desperation fills his eyes.  With one hand he pulls out THE KNIFE, and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK.  Better to kill himself than face what comes next.  The knife touches... A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one gold, another silver. Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold.  The goats start BLEATING in blind panic.  A shaft of moonlight comes through a porthole as the boat turns.  The moonlight falls on THE CRATES.  Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards them, drawn inexorably closer... closer...}

A BACH SONATA for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck. Pendergast hums along as he drives.  A SMALL TOWN COP rides shotgun. The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the morning's events.  He sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date.}

<ACTION>__{The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.  A hot sun beats down on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.  The boat lists at a crazy angle where it has been washed up on the shore.  At first glance, it appears to be deserted.  A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each successive wave.  We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad cars pulls up.  Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES. PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.  All of the cops immediately cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.  Pendergast sniffs once and frowns.  Apart from this, he doesn't react.}

He leans down, pulls them off one at a time.  He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and proceeds barefoot towards the boat. Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the Santa Lucia.  With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the deck.  At the top he touches a rail.  It's covered in a DARK STICKY}

Pendergast moves aft.  The COPS watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.  Pendergast hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.  He follows the noise and sees... THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.  He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the stairwell.  Below deck are BODIES... stacks of them.  They've been TORN TO SHREDS. THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of the stairs.  It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.  His face is frozen in a howl of terror.  Flies congregate in the eye sockets.  With his foot, Pendergast nudges the body over.  The skull has been torn open. THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD.}

She doesn't need it.  She has a natural, unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap. At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays. Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order, with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time. An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes.}

<ACTION>__{As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The structure fills an entire city block. Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release, the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN. Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher, MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent, calls after them as they all head inside.}

The same ones last seen in the hold of the ill-fated Santa Lucia.  They are scattered about in disarray.  One in particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor.

They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung systems of fish. MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms, mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE! Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.

<ACTION>__{The beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful, moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail. ON JONATHAN... staring, stunned. PENDERGAST... steady... MARGO... She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye. And the gun EXPLODES. ON MBWUN... its head shoots back in pain, and it falls... sixty feet straight down to the ground.  Silence.  Thunder rolls. It's over.  Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in his arms.}

Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from Columbus Ave.  Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the company to the ambulances. Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast.}

D'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.  And he likes it like that.  He rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet match. He's struggling hopelessly.  Finally he tosses the useless pack of matches, sighs.  But then a flame lowers right before his face.  He looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.  D'Agosta smiles, takes a nice long hit.}

He seems to be struggling with himself.  He glances over his shoulder to make sure he's alone.  Quickly he moves to a locked drawer.  He opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small envelope, looks inside. INSERT... the envelope is full of the PLANT FIBERS!  Greg has managed to keep his own cache! Moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide with a shaking hand.  With an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver, pops it into his mouth.  He closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the taste.  Then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the slide.  He takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer.  He turns the key carefully and we GO CLOSE ON HIS HAND... On the back is A ROW OF SCALES...}
