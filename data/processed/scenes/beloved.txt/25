<L>__{interior second floor of 124 morning.}
<A>__{denver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down in the kitchen. she stops. her face lights up.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{daddy?}
<A>__{she runs down the white staircase.}
<L>__{interior kitchen morning.}
<A>__{as denver runs into the kitchen, we hear:}
<C>__{sethe }
<D>__{won't you stay a little while? can't nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day.}
<A>__{denver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that leads from the second floor. she looks at paul wide eyed. they turn to her with gentle smiles;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{baby, this here's paul d. garner...paul, this is my denver...paul's the last of the sweet home men.}
<A>__{denver's heart sinks.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good morning miss denver. it's a pleasure.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{good morning, mr. d.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{garner, baby. paul d. garner.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{glad to get a look at you. last time i saw your mama, you were pushing out the front of her dress. she's a fine looking young lady, sethe. fine looking. got her daddy's sweet face.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you knew my father?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{knew him. knew him well.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{of course he did. i told you, he's from sweet home. paul may stay with us a while. won't that be nice, having an old friend stay a spell?}
<A>__{but denver reacts with surprise and dismay. paul is not her friend. paul, right now, is more of an intruder.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if that's all right with you, that is?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{we have a ghost here, you know.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we met. but sad, your mama said. not evil.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{no sir, not evil. but not sad either.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what then?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{lonely.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i don't see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{it's my sister. she was just a baby when she died in this house.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{reminds me of that headless bride back behind sweet home. remember that sethe? used to roam them woods regular.}
<C>__{denver}
<P>__{(annoyed, resentful)}
<D>__{mama doesn't like talk about sweet home. says it was never sweet and it sure wasn't home.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{girl, mind yourself!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{now, now, she got it right there, sethe.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{but it's where we were. all together. it's where i met your father. and it comes back on us whether we want it to or not....}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{then why don't you ever tell me about it?}
<A>__{sethe pauses unnerved and irritated by denver's challenge.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{denver, start up the stove. paul must be hungry.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't go to no trouble on my account.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{bread's no trouble. the rest i brought back from where i work. least i can do, cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner home. you got any objections to pike?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if he don't object to me i don't object to him.}
<A>__{he addresses his humor to denver who offers no response. she crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. she's mad.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{where's he going to sleep? baby sugg's room got no sheets or nothing.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{we'll figure it out.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{maybe you should stay with mama, mr. garner. then you two can talk about sweet home all night long.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you! i never knew you to behave like this!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{leave her be, sethe. i'm a stranger to her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{that's just it. she got no cause to act up with a stranger.}
<A>__{denver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. sethe moves to her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{baby, what is it? did something happen?}
<A>__{denver moves away. sethe registers this rejection.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{i can't no more! i can't no more!}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{can't what? what can't you?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{i can't live here! i don't know where to go or what to do but i can't live here. nobody speaks to us. nobody comes by. nobody even knows i'm alive.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what she talking about 'nobody speaks to you'?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it's the house. people don't...}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{it's not! it's not the house! it's us! it's you!}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{denver!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{leave off, sethe. it's hard for a young girl living in a haunted place. that can't be easy.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(growing irritated)}
<D>__{it's easier than some other things. come here, baby..}
<A>__{denver allows herself to be held.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and i'm telling you it' ain't easy. maybe you oughta move.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sethe!}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no. no moving. no leaving. it's all right the way it is.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you going to tell me it's all right with this child half out of her mind.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(holding denver in her arms)}
<D>__{i got a tree on my back and a haunt in my house and nothing in between but the daughter i'm holding in my arms. no more running from nothing! i will never run from another thing on this earth, you hear! i took one journey and i paid the ticket but let me tell you something, paul d. garner; it cost too much! do you hear me?! it cost too much! now sit down and eat with us or leave us be!}
<A>__{sethe's sudden outburst startles paul. he watches as sethe ushers denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to quiet her down. alone, paul is disturbed by sethe's words. he fishes out a pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for sethe to return. when she does, she heads straight for the stove. she spits on her finger and touches it to check it's heat. she then begins to make bread from flour, soda and salt keeping her back to paul throughout as the scene continues;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what tree, sethe?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what tree on your back? i don't see nothing growing on your back.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it's there all the same.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{white girl. that's what she called it. i never seen it and never will. but she said that's what it looked like. a chokecherry tree. leaves, branches. that was 18 years ago. could have cherries by now for all i know...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't follow.}
<A>__{sethe pauses. something in her decides to tell paul d, although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i had milk, see. i was pregnant with denver but i had milk for my baby girl that i sent ahead with the boys. i hadn't stopped nursing her when i sent her and the boys ahead of me. anybody could smell me long before they saw me. nothing i could do about it. all i knew is i had to get my milk to my little girl. nobody was going to nurse her like me. nobody was going to get it to her fast enough or take it away when she had enough..nobody knew she couldn't pass her air if you held her up on your shoulder, only if she was lying on your knee..nobody knew that but me...}
<A>__{paul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we was talking about a tree, sethe.}
<A>__{sethe works faster. it is the work, taking an action any action that allows her tell the story numbly, without the pain of reliving it...without the images attacking}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{schoolteacher's boys drag me into the barn and took my milk...}
<A>__{....yet, the images come anyway.}
