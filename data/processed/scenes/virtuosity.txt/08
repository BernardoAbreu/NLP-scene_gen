<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{parker}
<A>__{whose wrists and ankles are cuffed, being led into a prison interrogation room. dr. madison carter sits at a table, a visitor's badge clipped to her suit. a notepad in front of her.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(to the guard)}
<D>__{the cuffs won't be necessary.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{no offense, ma'am, but i don't think that's such a good idea.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{i would like the following three things in this order: your mouth shut, his cuffs off, and your ass outside the door. any questions?}
<A>__{the guard removes parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his post outside the door. the skin around parker's wrists is blue where the cuffs dug into his skin. parker sits across from madison. she places a microrecorder in the middle of the table and presses record.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you actually listen to all those tapes?}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{no, i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how you feeling today?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{a little less than yesterday.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{in other words, par for the course.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{john died.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{i know. i was there. i saw the whole thing.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if i was your therapist, i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're not my therapist. you're hear to study me. face it i'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{that's not true, parker.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{if i had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{not much. he was just a computer program. nothing more.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{you didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. but i did.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you kind of liked it, didn't you? that thrill of going over the edge again. of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{it was just like before, wasn't it? wasn't it?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but you are making progress. instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{the guard pokes his head in with concern.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{the guard quickly shuts the door. madison turns to parker.}
<C>__{madison }
<D>__{i need to know what snapped in you. what made you capable of it. you have to make me understand.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i don't have to do anything except survive. and it's taking everything i've got just to do that.}
