<L>__{interior un function room bar continuous}
<A>__{lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. we glimpse linton, karen, general miller. sir jonathan is there, mingling. malcolm approaches simon, toby, judy and sir jonathan.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to sir jonathan)}
<D>__{do not move from this spot or i will fucking stab you.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{was it you?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no, what? no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{but you know what i'm talking about?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no, but whatever it was i didn't do it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{was it you, the baby from eraserhead?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{so it must have been you woman from the crying game?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{it wasn't me. you've really got it in for me haven't you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{someone's dropped a bollock in the noodles and i reckon it was you.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we've done this all before. you accused me of leaking last time and it wasn't me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yeah well i know you didn't leak last time. but what i reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked this time.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, that does sound possible.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{look springer spaniel, keep your little wet nose out alright?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way. that's just something i've observed.}
<A>__{malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs sir jonathan, mid conversation, and manhandles him away.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{come on, baldermort, i need a word.}
<A>__{meanwhile judy and toby are left alone toby embarrassed about his comments.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(they look at each other)}
<D>__{sorry about that it's just ...}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{something i've observed.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{wanker. it's okay. it's fine. it's probably just the stress of this awful, awful war.}
<A>__{malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we're in a new reality now and you've got to speed things up.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{what things? speed up what?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{the debate. it needs to start at eleven o'clock, not one thirty.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{hehe. can i perhaps briefly explain the way the process works? and why that isn't possible? you see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{just fucking do it, fishlips. otherwise you'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the caucasus with your arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{no, it can't be. i mean it could be done, it just can't.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{then i will do it.}
<P>__{(motioning to a door)}
<D>__{they're through there?}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol ...}
<A>__{he's blocking malcolm. malcolm grabs his hand.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{then you do it. get in there.}
<A>__{he is almost man handling him in.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{i'm not dancing with you malcolm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm leading, look follow my lead.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{you're not dancing me into the secretariat!}
<A>__{jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in. as malcolm is leaving miller blocks his path.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{where's the intel? are you sure you're working as hard as me? cos i'm sweating spinal fluid here. i'm a husk.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you get everything you need?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(in a hurry)}
<D>__{oh yeah i think so. thanks.}
<P>__{(a beat, thinks)}
<D>__{oh, whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment general flintstone. was it you? did you leak pwip pip? i know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no, see, because i'm upfront about what i do. i don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm doing my own work. i'm doing my job.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{uh hu. i think you're doing linton's dirty work. i think you're his english bitch and if i walked into your hotel room tonight i'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oooo. tough talk from the armchair general. what you going to do? throw a cushion at me? put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{listen, tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in london, but here? you know what you look like? a fucking squeezed dick. you got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there. that's where i'd put the fucking bullet. but i'd stand well back. you look like you'd be a squirter.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{have you ever even killed anybody? really?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{falling asleep on someone doesn't count.}
<C>__{general miller}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{i've done my share. how many you kill, pussy drip?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{personally, i prefer maiming.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{go on, tough guy, take a swing at me. i will smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{go ahead. i can see the headlines now. 'peace loving general starts fight in un, swiss intervene'. i don't know, i'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career?}
<A>__{they eyeball each other. is miller going to hit him? he doesn't.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{right. do excuse me. i've got work to do. oh, and don't ever call me fucking english again.}
