<A>__{chase lays zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an overhead light onto the wound. geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the living, breathing dog.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{how'd it happen?}
<A>__{gus casts a threatening glance in drew's direction.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(glaring at gus)}
<D>__{some psycho hunter probably got trigger happy...}
<A>__{chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal exchange.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i'm going to give zowie a local anaesthetic so i can clean up the wound. i'd like to take him home tonight for observation.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{can you keep him at your place until he gets better?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{drew tenderly strokes zowie's mane as chase administers the injection. zowie stares up at geoff with dull, blank eyes. drew reads geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van. their words are clear, but whispered.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he was dead. you know he was.}
<A>__{geoff returns his stare to zowie.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you can't tell anyone, geoff. ever.}
<A>__{geoff looks into drew's eyes and nods in understanding.}
