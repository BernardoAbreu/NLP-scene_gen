<L>__{interior jewelry shop med. close shot tom and jeweler}
<A>__{the shop and its glittering display cases, which were brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy and dim. all artificial light is off. the jeweler is a bright eyed old man of seventy with a middle european accent. he is completely fascinated as he examines the diamond tom has given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. he speaks impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to pass by.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{eleanor, did you call the electrician?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(she's not too bright)}
<D>__{i tried, mr. bleeker. but the phone doesn't work, either.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(absently, as he studies the stone)}
<D>__{well, call the phone company.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(plaintively)}
<D>__{but the phone doesn't work.}
<A>__{the jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and turns back to the stone.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{is it worth anything?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i have never seen such a stone. will you please tell me where it came from?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's what i wanted you to tell me.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(overwhelmed and}
<D>__{absorbed by the stone, he shakes his head,}
<P>__{bewildered)}
<D>__{there are no diamonds like this any place in the world.}
<A>__{impressed by the import of what the man is saying, tom's mind is racing wildly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you sure about that?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(eagerly, shrewdly)}
<D>__{would you like to sell it?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(picking up the stone)}
<D>__{no no, thanks.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i'd give you a very good price.}
<A>__{preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, tom has already started for the door.}
