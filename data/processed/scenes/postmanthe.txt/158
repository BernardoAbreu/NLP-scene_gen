<L>__{interior airstream night}
<A>__{the postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope. he writes "bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a second letter. the door opens and abby enters.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ford thinks you're going to do something.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{the postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin to assemble.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{if i don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. he doesn't have your memories. none of them do. all they've got is the lousy world we gave them. and this is the only decent thing in it.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{what? being a postman? it's all bullshit, abby. all of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm. i made up the rest to stay fed. there is no restored united states.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i knew it was something like that.}
<A>__{the postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{weird thing is, being a postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me...}
<P>__{(re: red ribbon)}
<D>__{remember this? you left it behind that night.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i remember...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i always liked to think you left it on purpose. but maybe you just forgot it.}
<A>__{abby doesn't answer. she leaves instead.}
