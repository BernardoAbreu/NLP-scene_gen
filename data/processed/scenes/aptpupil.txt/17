<A>__{dussander bolts upright in his bed.}
<L>__{exterior outdoor shooting range day}
<A>__{richard (dick) bowden, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his son. he stands over todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a paper target. he still has on a tie from work, but the knot has been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up. both dick and todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses. dick chews gum. they are alone on the range. todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30 .30. a strained tension exists between the two bowdens.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you're tight. don't hold your breath so long.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{forget it. i can't concentrate.}
<A>__{he pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to his father. dick takes it and begins to reload it for him.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i know your upset. so am i. so is your mother.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{these honors classes... they aren't as easy as i thought they'd be. i totally admit it, i didn't prepare enough. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{well, fine, but now is not the time to slack off. you got a chance to finish at the top of your class }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{nobody wants that more than i do, dad.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{well you haven't been hitting the books very much.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i know...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{and seeing as you're not playing soccer this year it's not like you don't have enough time }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that still bothers you, doesn't it?}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{no, son. if you weren't enjoying it, then you shouldn't play.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i think it bothers you and you're not telling me.}
<A>__{dick decides to take a shot himself. he readies himself and fires.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that was lousy. here.}
<P>__{(gives the gun back to todd)}
<D>__{i want to see your grades come up, buddy. that's all that bothers me. and if you say you need more time to study, then that's what we'll do. the first thing is to cut out all the time you spend reading to mr. denker. it's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping our school work a bit.}
<A>__{dick is looking at his son, unsure if he has just seen a contortion of rage on his son's face. but todd is cocking the rifle and...}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{hey, todd. you still with me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah... no. dad, don't do that. please. don't punish mr. denker for something that's my fault. i mean, he'd be lost without me }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{he'll be fine without you. he was fine before and he'll be fine after. there's nothing wrong with wanting to help people, but you gotta make sure you got yourself squared away first. that's what matters.}
<A>__{todd turns to face his father, and speaks to him with a new seriousness.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{dad, am i like other kids?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{not by a long shot.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{then trust me on this. don't lose faith in me because i blew a couple of exams. i will get my grades back up. in fact i've already started. three days a week i go over to freddy tremain's for extra help. he's a wiz at trig. but please, dad, whatever you do, don't punish a helpless old man for something that's my fault.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{did you practice that in front of a mirror or something?}
<A>__{todd smiles. feeling his father caving in, he aims the rifle and squeezes off a round. dick keeps his eyes on todd as he shoots.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{hey, he's not...?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(it takes him a second)}
<D>__{...no.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{just checking.}
<P>__{(thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{all right... we'll give your way a shot. if you think you can do it, if you really do, and your serious, then... okay. you really like the old guy, don't you?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm making a difference in somebody's life. it's that simple.}
<A>__{todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger. the gun jams. todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<P>__{(takes the rifle)}
<D>__{don't ever force it. watch.}
<A>__{dick begins to methodically unjam the gun.}
