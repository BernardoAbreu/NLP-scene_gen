<D>__{when you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake. i hadn't slept in four days...}
<L>__{interior small protestant church night}
<A>__{jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around. people are chattering with each other.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{ but, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five day headache. yet they forced themselves to be positive. they never said "parasite;" they said "agent." they always talked about getting better.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{okay, everyone.}
<A>__{everyone sits in chairs. jack catches sight of marla.}

<C>__{jack }
<D>__{ahh, chloe. chloe looked the way joni mitchell's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everyone.}
<C>__{chloe}
