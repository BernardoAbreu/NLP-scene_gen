<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{a facsimile of the bellagio vault sprouts into shape. livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image (of frank staple gunning floorboard into place) to a security tape of the real mccoy. on the other side of the garage, turk and virgil go to work on their newly purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches. tishkoff recognizes a gasket virgil handles.}

<D>__{this looks familiar. where'd you get this?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{off your rolls.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{danny! tell 'em not to touch the rolls!}
<A>__{overlooking the whole enterprise is danny, grinning from ear to ear, happy in his work. he checks a stopwatch in his hand as... ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open, revealing yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded into a three by four foot space. he whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply. danny checks his watch.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{29:47. everything okay in there?}
