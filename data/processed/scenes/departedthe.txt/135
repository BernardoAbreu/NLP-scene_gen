<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i look around at your guys. they're all murderers right? i think "could i do murder?" and all i can answer myself is, "what's the difference".}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{give em up to the almighty. like that.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, that's my pointerior you accuse me once, i put up with it. you accuse me twice, i quit. if you make me fear for my life, i put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else.}

<C>__{costello}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{you got something you want to say to me, william?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you're seventy fucking years old. one of these guys is going to pop you. as for running drugs, what the fuck. you don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. and you don't need the money.}
<A>__{costello smiles, and continues with the sketch. later he will light up the paper.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{i haven't needed "the money" since i took archie's milk money in the third grade. tell the truth, i don't need pussy any more,but i still like it.}

<C>__{costello}
<D>__{sure, sure, all that aside...but you bill, what would you do?}
<A>__{costello sketching.}
