<C>__{tod}
<D>__{not just any 'local' girl.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{the 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter.}

<C>__{tod}
<D>__{trust me, we did the deed.}

<A>__{at the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well gentlemen, there she is.}
<A>__{the cab stops. besides many colorful fishing boats, is the albatross. at ninety two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor. her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck. breathtaking.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{home sweet hell on the water.}
