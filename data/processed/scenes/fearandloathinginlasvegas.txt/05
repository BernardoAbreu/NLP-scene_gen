<A>__{a uniformed dwarf, carries a shockingly pink telephone through the glittering, tranquil pogo lounge crowd. they are the eloi. hendrix afros and drooping mustaches and bell bottoms and love beads and bells. actresses sip singapore slings and promoters sip actresses in this monied, sanitised}

<A>__{gonzo, says nothing for a moment, then pounds the table!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{god hell! i think i see the pattern! this one sounds like real trouble! you're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. as your attorney i must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. and then the tape recorder, for special music, and some acapulco shirts...}
