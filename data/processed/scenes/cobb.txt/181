<A>__{the rain pours down on the cemetery. thunder. lightning. cobb still holds stump by the throat.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{well?! is that what you want?! 'cause that's all i know and the only other people who know about it are dead! but it ain't going in the book, either, 'cause you're the only friend i got left, and you're the only man i can trust.}
<A>__{cobb lets stump go, relaxing his grip and stump rages back outside into the rain. cobb stays dry in the doorway of the mausoleum.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i don't want to be your friend! i don't want to feel sorry for you! so your mother's lover blew your father's head off! i don't care. you were a prick before it happened, you were a prick after it happened, you've been a prick ever since, and you're a prick now!}
<A>__{cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway of the mausoleum, watching stump rant and rave in the rain.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{public relations are overrated.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{what the hell're you talking about?}
<A>__{cobb holds out his flask for stump.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you need a drink.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{fuck the drink!}
<A>__{cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards them.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're too angry, al, you just gotta learn to let it out.}
<A>__{stump stands in the rain screaming at cobb who stands out of the rain, calm, centered, drinking, dying.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i'm gonna tell the truth about you, cobb! i'm gonna tell the world you hate women, jews, and niggers!}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{you shouldn't use the word 'nigger', stumpy, it's racist and demeaning. and i don't hate women i'm just not very good with 'em, which puts me in the same boat with you and every other man i know.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you treat people like dirt!}
<A>__{cobb comes out into the rain toward stump.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{the children of america need heroes, al, you know that...}
<A>__{cobb takes him by the arm and tries to lead him to the limo.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{get your hands off me!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{c'mon, al...}
<P>__{(taking by the arm)}
<D>__{you're making a fool of yourself out here. it's not dignified...}
<P>__{(helpfully)}
<D>__{come in out of the rain...}
<A>__{and cobb helps stump into the limo, which pulls out of the cemetery still being drenched by rain.}
