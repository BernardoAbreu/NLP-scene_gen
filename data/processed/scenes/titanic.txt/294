<L>__{exterior boat deck port side}
<A>__{second officer lightoller is loading the boat nearest cal and rose... boat}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{women and children only! sorry sir, no men yet. another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. startled faces turn upward. fear now in the eyes. daniel marvin has his biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has mary posed in front of the scene at the boats.}
<C>__{marvin}
<A>__{you're afraid, darling. scared to death. that's it! either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified. rose watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step closer to the boat. husbands saying goodbye to wives and children. lovers and friends parted. nearby molly is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{come on, you heard the man. get in the boat, sister.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{will the lifeboats be seated according to class? i hope they're not too crowded }
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{oh, mother shut up!}
<P>__{(ruth freezes, mouth open)}
<A>__{don't you understand? the water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. half the people on this ship are going to die.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{not the better half. push in on rose's face as it hits her like a thunderbolt. jack is third class. he doesn't stand a chance. another rocket bursts overhead, bathing her face in white light.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{you unimaginable bastard.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{come on, ruth, get in the boat. these are the first class seats right up here. that's it. molly practically hands her over to lightoller, then looks around for some other women who might need a push.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{come on, rose. you're next, darlin'. rose steps back, shaking her head.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{rose, get in the boat!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{goodbye, mother. ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. cal grabs rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. cal catches up to rose and grabs her again, roughly.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{where are you going? to him? is that it? to be a whore to that gutter rat?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i'd rather be his whore than your wife. he clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward the lifeboat. rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{lower away!!}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{rose! rose!!}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{stuff a sock in it, would ya, ruth. she'll be along. the boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out. tracking with rose, as she runs through the clusters of people. she looks back and a furious cal is coming after her. she runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{that man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd! appalled, they turn to see cal running toward them. rose runs on as the two men grab cal, restraining him. she runs throught the first class entrance. cal breaks free and runs after her. he reaches the entrance, but runs into a knot of people coming out. he pushes rudely through them...}
