<A>__{from above, a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{ah, there they go. my happy and contented flock. spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again.}
<A>__{bishop anthony lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance with a warm, beautiful smile. he turns from the window to his valet, dennis, as derek and rosemary get in their car.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{did you enjoy the sermon today, dennis?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{very inspiring, your grace. though the segue of the forces of satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression.}
<A>__{he whisks a lint brush over the bishop's robes before putting them away.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{hmm, yes. a trifle purple, i thought. still, fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty, miserable sinners that we are?}
<A>__{a gentle smile spreads across his mouth.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{and speaking of sin, i wonder which of the seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with today.}
<A>__{dennis finishes with the bishop's robes and sweeps the closet door shut.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{perhaps pride, your grace.}
<A>__{lilliman chuckles.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{i was thinking of something a little less ethereal. has the young lady arrived?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{the agency informed me she'll be here directly. however, there was a mixup. it's not one of the usual girls. she's a little older.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{oh dear. oh dear. not too old, i trust?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{they promise me she's no more than fifteen.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{fifteen, hmm.}
<A>__{the bishop rubs his cheek, ponderously.}
<C>__{lilliman}
<D>__{ah well, if job could bear his disappointments, i suppose i must have the good grace to bear mine. show her in when she arrives.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{yes, your grace.}
