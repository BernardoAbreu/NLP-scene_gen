<T>__{pull back to reveal:}
<D>__{this is being watched by the duke of norfolk, and sir thomas boleyn. norfolk's face is dark and brooding..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{for the moment he's still visiting mary. but for how long? the queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little spanish things. not to mention the seymours with that girl of theirs. norfolk looks up...}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{what we need is someone from our family who will keep the king focused on mary, reminding him of her while she is absent. sir thomas is about to speak, then changes his mind.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{what? speak..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{it's just...i was going to suggest anne.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{you couldn't control that girl last time. what makes you think it would be any different now?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{i've had favourable reports from the dowager queen in france. it seems she is quite changed. interior mary's apartment day mary sits up. her eyes widen in horror..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why? sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother george..}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but the king visits me every day. there's no need for her. or anyone else.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they just want to protect you. leave nothing to chance.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but in who's interests do they imagine anne will act? certainly not mine. george turns, looks all around him..}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{why do they make this room such a dungeon? does it really need to be this dark? george notices mary's vexed expression..}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't worry. she's had three years to forgive you. and she's not going to risk being sent away again. she'll do as she's told, i'm sure.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{besides, the most important thing is.. george moves mary's lips into an upward shape..}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the three of us will be together again. mary's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..}
