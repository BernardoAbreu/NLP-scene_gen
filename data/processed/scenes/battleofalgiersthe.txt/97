<A>__{the port is deserted, the cranes still. a loaded ship sways lazily at her moorings, the fork lifts are filled with supplies ... the limestone is dried out, the bridges empty, dangling cables swing slowly from the pulleys. there is silence in the docks ... then, the sound of motors approaching, clouds of dust, arabs pushed out of the trucks, into the shipyard.}
<L>__{97 streets of algiers. outside. day.}
<A>__{in the streets of the european city, there is an atmosphere of fear and doubt. the shop windows have their shutters lowered halfway, the shopkeepers are standing in the doorways, ready to close. the front doors of houses are shut. there are a few hurried passersby but no automobiles; the trams are not running; on the sidewalks the garbage is piled high, nearby the long brooms of the algerian street cleaners.}
