<A>__{a multi colored screen after a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: a single, striped tulip, planted in a long row of other tulips. a hand reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. we then cut to: a basket of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. the door of the truck is shut and we cut to: the door of the truck opening to reveal that the tulips are now boxed and crated. a forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a manned cart across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the bloenen markt (check this steven) in amsterdam, netherlands. the cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity. the cart arrives in the auction room, which is constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi circle, facing two giant, clock shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. the striped tulips fetch a very high price. the carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. they end up on a truck heading for the airport.}

<C>__{customer}
<D>__{wow. how do they do that?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{it's an accident. it means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage. the flaws create the unusual coloring.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{can you arrange something for me with those?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{of course. what kind of price range are you looking for?}
<A>__{now we see the customer: tess.}

<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{no, felix, no. i paid for pure. and if my workshop were on top of mount everest it would be pure. but i'm at sea level, felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. if it's pure, that is. which this isn't.}
<A>__{rusty makes another turn. a few seconds later, the cadillac turns behind him.}
<C>__{felix }
<D>__{well, i didn't know you were going to liquefy it.}
<A>__{rusty pulls to a stop light. the cadillac pulls up three cars behind him.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{let me ask you something: when christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to christo, "well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of australia"?}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{who's christo?}

<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals. the highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world. between six and ten high level crews are operating in europe at any given time. worldwide, no more than twenty. the most famous, gaspar lemarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. the good news is the trend is toward their extinction.}
<A>__{the secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the podium.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{for example: anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable.}
<A>__{the higher ups look at each other; what did she just say?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. they tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate.}
<A>__{many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering if this is appropriate.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom. their lives are treated as secondary. many of them suffer from depression. it's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage.}

<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{we can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. we thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{no, that would have triggered the system.}
<A>__{isabel goes to the alarm pad. pulls the face plate off, examines the inside.}

<D>__{and damaged the circuits.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{well, then i don't know how they got in.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{they had to have known the code.}
<A>__{she moves on to look in the mark's bedroom.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(calls to her)}
<D>__{we considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him. he programmed the last seven steps of the system himself. he set it and never left the house again. when he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line.}
<A>__{isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in vanderspeigle's bedroom closet. she answers the detective almost as an afterthought.}
<C>__{isabel}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{again, isabel is inside her own mind. she's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars.}
<A>__{we go with him as he walks back into the office. he stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. he twists around and looks out the window behind him.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(calling to isabel in the bedroom)}
<D>__{actually, i don't know about that.}
<A>__{isabel re enters the office.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this }
<A>__{he stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers. it's an obviously unnatural position. then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{ then his body would block the view from across the canal.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{that's why they probably set up over there }
<A>__{she points out an adjacent window on another wall.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{ and used the mirror.}
<A>__{she points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. the detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. he can see directly across the canal into another house.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{i'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but }
<A>__{but isabel's already moved on. something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it. isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area. when she pulls her finger away there is paint on it. isabel cocks her head. mind's eye (isabel) the night before a black clad thief (linus) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad. back to scene the crime scene the lead detective watches isabel intently.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the painterior the plaster there is soft and wet. in fact it isn't plaster at all. it's spackle.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{isabel cooks her head again. mind's eye (isabel) the night before thunk! a crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel. back to scene the crime scene}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{it's where the crossbow bolt hit.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{a crossbow bolt?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{ever heard of franz schuman?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{isabel is at the window. the one that vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night. isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where basher and saul were playing cards.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{they would have fired from that roof. through this open window.}
<A>__{isabel kneels down, checks the line of sight to make sure she's correct.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{from that roof, through this window? nobody could make a shot like that.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{not a cop, anyway.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{sorry. your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's an idiot. you shouldn't let him bother you.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{yes. you're right.}
<A>__{isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "eugene `basher' tarr." there are two names above basher's in her little book: "robert ryan" and "danny ocean."}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{but these man are exceptionally good. even when they make mistakes.}
<A>__{mind's eye (isabel) the night before a bolt flies through vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad. two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. the wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal. inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability. in effect the group now has a mini clothesline running between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal. livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline" that runs across the canal. back to scene the crime scene isabel writes: "livingston dell?" underneath basher's name in her notebook. mind's eye (isabel) the night before livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel. magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad. livingston then types a six digit code into a remote keypad. his keypunches are mimicked by the remote device. vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off. downstairs: from inside we see the front door lock picked. the door swings open. back to scene the crime scene isabel nods her head. there's a slight smile on her face. the smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{when did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the alarm woke him at 4:2o am.}

<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{oh... oh, i know what happened.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{isabel quickly glances around the room. her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase. on some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet. she kneels down for a closer look.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{there was someone else.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{someone else.}
<A>__{mind's eye (isabel) the night before danny and rusty come through the front door. they are followed by linus. all of them are soaking wet from 24 hours in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door. the group silently slips up the stairs.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{oh, i wish i could've have seen that.}
<L>__{interior vanderspeigle office night}
<A>__{they enter vanderspeigle's office. you can hear him snoring in the other room. danny and rusty quickly, carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window. they drop it (and the attached wires) to the malloys, who are waiting on the street below. meanwhile linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle. danny and rusty turn to see that linus is finished. they hand signal each other like special forces guys do, then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{that must have really been something.}
<A>__{suddenly:}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{wait! wait! shhhh!}
<A>__{everyone freezes. danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard. we hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves. danny and rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the bookcase. what the hell? they yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of vanderspeigle's safe. danny and rusty stare at him. he turns around and sees them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't showing it. danny approaches him. this exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range.}
