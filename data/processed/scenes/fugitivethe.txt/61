<A>__{the four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer chained together. near the front, prisoner #1 is eyeing... the two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. young guard lighting a smoke. old guard drowsing. shotguns bouncing on their knees. prisoner #l shifts his gaze to... the driver. pistol on his hip.}

<A>__{prisoner #1 rises. through caging:}
<D>__{prisoner #1 hey. illinois penal regulations require a meal for transport rides of four hours or more.}
<A>__{young guard shakes his head. "fucking jailhouse lawyers." checks his watch: 4:00.}
<C>__{young guard}
<D>__{jack! feedin' time.}
<A>__{old guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key ring from his belt. young guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker. prisoner #2 looks at kimble. kimble stirs awake... watches the cage door open, young guard moving back. and across the aisle... prisoner #3, a big man named copeland, wags his head between his knees. something slides out of his shirt and clanks to the dimpled steel floor. it's a razor sharp plastic shank. heart quickening, kimble looks forward. young guard is handing a petrified sandwich to prisoner #1. kimble snaps a look back to copeland, who palms the shank.}

<D>__{suit yourself.}

<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{too late... jackknifing up, copeland drives the shank into young guard's gut. prisoner #2 dives for young guard's holster. as the gun comes out, young guard gets a hand on it. a shot fires... jolting old guard. he chambers his shotgun. kimble hits the floor. the old guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside, but... prisoner #1 broadsides old guard. shotgun discharges... opening a big gainsburger hole in the driver. he sinks under the steering wheel. a knee hits the accelerator. the cage door slams locked behind the old guard.}
