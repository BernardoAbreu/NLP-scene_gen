<A>__{soaring across the pristine deep blue waters of lake tahoe. rising, revealing the gaudy, mirrored glass tower of the nomad hotel & casino. we slowly dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior penthouse suite nomad hotel & casino morning}
<A>__{buddy israel, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. he absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch, telepathy. he gazes out at the snow packed peaks. behind him; post bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. prostitutes, passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto heels, lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays, coke covered tabletops and tipped room service trays. israel, sober now...contemptuous of it all. he starts walking around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield. his bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the hooker's wigs, tugging it free. israel looks down, zooming in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and disdain. he steps, the wigs pulls. he stops and slips the bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains. he shuffles, begins dropping aces on their bodies like dead enemy soldiers. one of his bodyguards enters; a bulging, slow witted, ex bodybuilder by the name of hugo croop.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{d'you talk to'm?}
<C>__{hugo}
<P>__{(fetching mylanta from the fridge)}
<D>__{i got his machine.}
<A>__{a beat. israel fidgets, twitches, rubs coke residue from his nose and over his gumline}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{hugo}
<P>__{(gulping mylanta)}
<D>__{i said i got his machine.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{no, what did you say on the machine?}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i left him a message.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{i know you left him a message. what did you say!}
<A>__{hugo looks up, seems confused. moments pass. israel, the patience of a gorilla, crammed into a canary cage.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{jesus hugo!}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{how is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? this is zero degree of difficulty man!}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{then why are you still looking at me like i'm asking for the square root of something! what did you say!?}
<A>__{hugo, still unsure, speaks in spite of it.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. now, do you know anything about that?}
<A>__{israel wrist flicks a playing card, it embeds a sofa cushion like a ninja throwing star, right next to a beige coat.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{look at the collar on that coat...}
<A>__{hugo, wary, walking over, inspecting the coat from a distance.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{what's that look like, that stain?}
<A>__{hugo edges closer, looks down at the coat, squints.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i dunno...cinnamon roll?}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{cinnamon roll? no, good guess though. no, hugo that looks like jizz...}
<P>__{(reshuffles, stares)}
<D>__{and i'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. the twist? it's my twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.}
<P>__{(beat, then)}
<D>__{so y'got semen, human ejaculate }
<C>__{israel }
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{ that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? work it's way into the fabric fuck'n fibers and while you may never see it in a tide commercial, i think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."}
<A>__{hugo takes another pull off the mylanta bottle, moving slowly, like most morons do, avoiding eye contact at all cost.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i could have it sent out...}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{...to what? incinerate? 'cuz i'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.}
<P>__{(beat, cooling down)}
<D>__{now, the money question...to whom does that stain belong?}
<A>__{hugo, gameface falling apart...israel prods him.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{c'mon, somebody was banging one of these skanks, sans rubber }
<P>__{(beat, assesses girls)}
<D>__{ which is terrifying in its own right pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined the last gift my mother gave me before she died.}
<P>__{(snatching up coat)}
<D>__{the way i see it, it's the same as if she was dug up, three months dead and it was shot right on her rotting corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled this feels!}
<A>__{hugo. long pause. big dumb blush.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{do you want me to say i did it?}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{i was kinda hoping, yeah.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{do you want me to say i'm sorry?}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{only if you really, truly mean it.}
<A>__{hugo, swallowing, pressures on. the phone begins to ring.}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{...i'm sorry...}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{are you a fucking colossal idiot?}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i am. yeah.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{without peer?}
<C>__{hugo}
<D>__{i uh, yeah, i guess, yeah.}
<A>__{cards dance, israel's hands moves at lightspeed, he reaches into hugo's shirt front and pulls a playing card out...joker.}
<C>__{israel}
<P>__{(showing him the card)}
<D>__{no. be sure. be resolute. you stand alone on that summit.}
<A>__{the phone rings. hugo, wobbly, what to do...? buddy fires all fifty two cards into his face. the beast barely blinks.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{get the phone, it might be gill, then get out of my sight.}
<A>__{hugo, furtive look to the floor, all those scattered cards, then, back to the boss, "should i?"}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{no. the cards can stay there. get the goddamn phone.}
