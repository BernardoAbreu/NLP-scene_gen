<L>__{exterior 19th hole outdoor bar day (later)}
<A>__{tin cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much of the gallery. he's a local hero but molly's not impressed. a waitress delivers a tray of long neck beers.}
<D>__{19th hole waitress beer for everybody.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{you the man, tin cup!}
<A>__{a toast is raised to their king, and tin cup eats it up.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{thanks, boys, what'ya think was my best shot the seven iron on twelve, the seven iron on fourteen, or maybe it was the bunker shot on eighteen which, to my recollection was a seven iron?}
<A>__{much laughter. this is the tin cup they love.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you definitely the man!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{how'd i do, doc?}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{you failed miserably.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what?! i parred the back nine with a seven iron, i qualified for the regionals, i }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{your job is not just to qualify for the open, it's to prepare for the open. my job is to help you prepare.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you said to 'trust my feelings'!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i didn't know you felt like breaking all the clubs in your bag.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{he didn't break the seven!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{he smoked that seven, brother }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{from what i understand, the u.s. open is the most difficult golf tournament in the world played under the most difficult circumstances with the greatest players winning it means controlling yourself, managing your emotions, staying cool, not getting in a pissing contest with your caddie who, incidentally, quit.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{he always quits, he always comes back.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{nonetheless, from the mental aspect which is my domain you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{'regression, delusion, denial'? you gotta use all this psychological language?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm a psychologist.}
<A>__{tin cup turns to the regulars for support.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{have a bad day, roy?}
<A>__{everyone turns to see david simms enter the conversation.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hi, honey...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i shot 65 parred the backside with a seven iron.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{that's the question why?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{'cause he broke all his other clubs.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{snapped 'em in two even the putter.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{jesus, roy, i'm on your side here. we go way back... i hope you get into the open, but if you don't play under control, you'll get slaughtered. good players shoot 82 in the open. you can't always go for it.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{swear to god, doc, this guy is not who you think.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{it's a well known fact that if a camera's not on him, he treats old people and children like dirt.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{and dogs.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{yeah, don't forget the dogs.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i think we should go, david.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i think so...}
<A>__{tin cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let go.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you ever shoot par with a seven iron?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{it never occurred to me to try.}
<P>__{(to molly)}
<D>__{c'mon, let's go. the car's over here....}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i will bet you a thousand dollars against my car that i can beat you in any game any game, you name it with a seven iron.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you a coward? you gonna lay up the way you did at the masters last year?}
<C>__{regulars}
<P>__{(taunting, like children)}
<D>__{chickie, chickie, chickie...}
<A>__{simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge as the desire to shut up tin cup.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{any game, i name it?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, come on, david }
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i just want to teach him a lesson.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{why do men insist on measuring their dicks?}
<A>__{tin cup takes her literally and rises, starting to unbuckle his belt.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{awright, awright! let's measure, right now!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{for god sakes, i wasn't being literal!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{david, let's go.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{molly, trust me on this one. call it part of his mental preparation for the open, where the rough is deep, the greens are slick, and the nerves are shattered.}
<P>__{(to tin cup)}
<D>__{i will take the bet.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, jeez...}
<A>__{the regulars cheer this is what they live for. simms hands a roll of cash to molly. tin cup hands her his car keys.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{awright! what's the game?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{one swing each. who can hit the longest seven iron }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{it's a lock! i hit the seven like john daly hits a three!}
<A>__{the regulars whoop it up. their man's a cinch. tin cup pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the ground in the middle of the patio.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{from right here, okay?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{fine with me.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you guys are really being childish }
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{molly, leave this one to me.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{dr. griswold, i know what i'm doing.}
<A>__{tin cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out onto an open area of the course. serious, intent, the look of eagles...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{dollar bills...}
<A>__{he takes a full back swing, opens beautifully, and launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his faithful. the ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{them signs are at least thirty yards farther that ball musta gone 220...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{that ball's about 2 2 7... toed it a bit... but it'll do...}
<C>__{regulars}
<D>__{nearly 230 with a seven! pureed it, baby, he pureed it!}
<A>__{tin cup hands simms the seven iron.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{take a minute to limber up, fine with me }
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{don't need to.}
<A>__{simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{take your jacket off?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{no, no, i'm fine.}
<A>__{simms drops a ball about where tin cup's sat. he stands above the ball and addresses it.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(cockily)}
<D>__{you're gonna need to muscle up, big guy give it the old steroid jerk...}
<A>__{simms is cool as ice. he smiles, then moves around to the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the course. this baffles everyone.}
<C>__{regulars}
<D>__{what the hell you doin'? wha's this?}
<A>__{and david simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward the desert, onto the lonely highway... ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for about three miles, forever. it's probably still going...}
<B>__{close on tin cup}
<A>__{the hustler's been hustled.}
<B>__{close on molly}
<A>__{she shrugs and smiles.}
