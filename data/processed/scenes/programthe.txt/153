<A>__{alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. he's still a little groggy from anesthetic. coach winters stands beside him.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you look good, alvin.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{yeh, i feel o.k.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{any of the guys been down yet?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{they called.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{hell, you know how football players are about hospitals and injuries.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{yeh.}
<A>__{several beats of silence. then:}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{i'm never gonna play again, am i?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{doctors aren't always right, alvin... but i just want you to know... you're the best defensive football player i ever coached.}
<A>__{alvin nods. winters comes forward, hugs him around the head, gives him a smile, walks out. tears brim in winters eyes as he leaves. alvin's head goes back against the pillow. tears aren't brimming here. they're rolling down his cheeks.}
<B>__{music begins}
