<L>__{exterior stone canyon morning.}
<A>__{flor purposefully walking up the hill..}
<L>__{interior clasky house day.}
<A>__{as flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once in the kitchen she sees the children and evelyn are swimming in the pool...she opens the glass door monica bumped into on interview day.}
<L>__{exterior clasky pool day.}
<A>__{evelyn, bernice and georgie are in the pool..cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{hey, mom...is it okay if we don't leave right away?}
<A>__{the others call greetings..save evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool..flor is awkward..no idea how to handle this...so she goes direct.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(as cristina begins to protest)}
<D>__{no..and we must say "goodbye." i don't work here anymore.}
<A>__{she then talks spanish to cristina..admonishing her not to embarrass them..something about flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but it is said with total calm.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{do i have to get out?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no, georgie..stay. i think you are a wonderful boy..be good..like you are. there are no monsters.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{thanks..thanks. okay.}
<A>__{bernice climbs out of the pool. meanwhile, a flabbergasted cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in spanish.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(severely to georgie)}
<D>__{i can't believe you didn't get out.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{flor said.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(to flor)}
<D>__{i don't want to get you wet.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{get me wet.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(rushing to hug her)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{bernice hugs her. evelyn hugs cristina..}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you...are...a...trip.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(to bernice)}
<D>__{you're a beauty. amazing girl.}
<A>__{despite herself, bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over the display...now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice. incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as deborah calling flor from the master bedroom window..bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as flor ignores it...bernice goes to embrace cristina.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{my last chance to have some of you rub off on me..}
<P>__{(cristina doesn't understand)}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse.}
<C>__{cristina}
<P>__{(from her depths)}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{and now deborah calling "flor" is getting hard to ignore but flor manages..}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(to cristina)}
<D>__{why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to deborah?}
<A>__{flor flashes a look of thanks.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i will be in front.}
<A>__{upset, cristina runs off. she kisses bernice..and walks toward the house. as she passes under the bedroom..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{please come see me.}
<A>__{and then a crying cristina appears on the deck. flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange}
<C>__{deborah's voice}
<D>__{it's okay, honey..we'll see each other at school..i'm going to keep an eye on you..i will.}
<A>__{flor enters the house...}
