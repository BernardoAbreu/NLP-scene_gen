<L>__{interior new haven stage that night}
<A>__{the doors on stage, jim eyes masked, facing death at a mock execution, in full black leather armor.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{present arms!... the famous drum roll, tension building. sudden sound of guitar. jim crumples to the ground. blood shooting from his mouth.}
<D>__{jim & doors make a grave for the unknown soldier nestled in your hollow shoulder the unknown soldier practice as the news is read television children dead bullet strikes the helmet's head it's all over the war is over!}
<A>__{the audience is enrapt. jim suddenly jumps up, looses the blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs into willie dixon's back door man.}
<D>__{jim & doors oh yeeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhh! ayyyyyyaaaaammmmaaa back door man.}
<A>__{the fans go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. instamatics flashing rapidly as the kids press forward at jim fondling the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft.}
<D>__{jim & doors well the men don't know but the little girls unnerstan'...}
<A>__{joints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked. a teenage boy & girl make a break thru the cordon of cops at the front of the stage, heading for jim. the cops chase them down mid stage, and wrestle them back to the edge throwing them back into the audience.}
<D>__{jim & doors when all the good people are trying to sleep i'm out there making my midnight creep yeah, cause i'm a backdoor man the men don't know but the little girls unnerstan'...}
<A>__{danger fills the air, electric. jim strutting, indian like, up to one of the cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it to the crowd, which roars with approval. a couple cops looking at jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how. they shuffle and look offstage for direction. their apparent impotence brings redoubled jeering from the kids. ray, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a look with john as they head into the instrumental break in the song. there's something different about jim more demonic, more driven a spirit has taken him over. ray's pov jim catching his look, but no recognition in those eyes. they're dark pools, like warhol's eyes. he turns away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i wanna tell you 'bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in new haven. this is new haven isn't it? new haven, connecticut, united states of america?}
<A>__{the crowd yells in acknowledgement, one stoned teenager naked from the waist up and ripped on beer, yelling out.}
<C>__{heckler}
<D>__{hey morrison, is the west really the best or are you just stoned on weeeeeedddddd??????}
<C>__{voice's}
<P>__{(annoying)}
<D>__{"light my fire". sing "light my fire". yeah. give us light my fire!...}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{we want mick jagger! take your clothes off jim. show it to us! we want the lizard king!}
<A>__{jim ignores it, sits on the stage, lights a cigarette. long pause, tension building. their catcalls for "light my fire" die out as jim faces them down. they wait... not knowing what happens nexterior}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{well i was with this girl backstage, y'know. we got to talking and we wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower stall. we weren't doin' anything y'know jes' standing there and talking.}
<A>__{the audience laughing, the band continuing to play, john adding emphasis to jim's words with various shots and rolls. camera moving over the crowd picking out the kids, sensing the anarchy dormant in their faces.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...and then this little man came in there, this little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap...}
<A>__{more cops turning to face jim from front stage, getting the point now. ray sees it coming...}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(redneck voice)}
<D>__{and he said "whatcha doin' there?" i said, "nuthin'" and he said, "well you better get outta there or..." "or what" i asked him...}
<A>__{the audience has now grown deadly silent. nearly every cop is facing jim as he uses his dumb southerner voice. ray's eyes warning jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and he started pushing me and i pushed back and he didn't like that so he reached back there and got out his little can of mace. and sprayed it right in my eyes. and blinded me. why? cause i was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if he could ever get it up without a gun.}
<A>__{the lights coming on suddenly, the audience seething. shouts of "fuck em! right on!"}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{in the united states of america. land of the free. home of the brave man in god we trust right? turn off the lights.}
<A>__{crowd roars. a police lieutenant in his 50's, grey hair, beefy, marches out onto the stage, standing next to jim, arms akimbo. a second cop joins him. ray rolling the music out into a silence as jim sticks the mike in the officer's face, defiantly.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{say your thing man!}
<A>__{more cops come out, snatch the microphone, as jim flashes the audience a "touchy aren't they?" shrug.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{young man you've gone too far. the show's over. you're under arrest.}
<A>__{two more cops moving on jim, pinning both his arms and dragging him off stage.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{they're gonna beat the shit out of him man!}
<A>__{ray moving to intercede with siddons and roadies.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(resisting)}
<D>__{hey... hey! hey!}
<A>__{ray and siddons are pushed aside by other cops. the crowd is going nuts. chairs are thrown. kids rushing onto the stage where the cops beat them back. anne is writing it all down on her notepad. a certain satisfaction and joy at the unfolding of this event.}
