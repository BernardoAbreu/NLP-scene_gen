<A>__{in foreground, rows of makeup in startling profusion: mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. half a dozen beautiful models giggle into their makeup mirrors. in the background vicki wanders past with a stylish friend, claire, who owns and operates the studio.}

<D>__{... of course, after corto maltese, this must all seem pretty tame.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{not to me. i need a job.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{now vicki. everyone knows you've got your hooks in bruce wayne.}

<D>__{oh. really. well. come on, dear, tony's dying to see you.}
<A>__{in a corner of the studio, tony, a gaunt, tubercular brit, is shooting a swimsuit layout with two supermodels. they all ad lib greetings to vicki as tony darts around hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.}

<A>__{as vicki looks on, the supermodels freeze in place simultaneously, a strange, stricken look on their faces.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{my god no, don't stop now, those smiles, i need those smiles }
<A>__{suddenly the girls are laughing but the laughter is unnatural, involuntary. vicki, sensing that something is terribly wrong, lays a hand on claire's arm. the models, now wearing huge smiles, begin to twitch spasmodically. tony snaps away.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{yes! oh baby, yes! that's }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no! too far, too far! pull back, pull back!}
<P>__{(dropping the camera)}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{the supermodels pitch to the floor, shuddering convulsively, their lips drawn back in frightful, frozen, lab ape grins. vicki gasps. claire screams. tony screams.}
