<A>__{three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons cradled in their arms. behind them is a line of yew bushes. as we watch, the officer on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes. several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the officer on the right. the officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right. then he looks hard. he grips his weapon tight, and swings left. no one there, either. anderson drops him hard, from behind. the officer crumples onto the cement. but anderson's not done with him. anderson lifts him up, struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance. anderson holds him upright in place. the man's head lolls backward. which is. perfect for what anderson needs to do. anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes. he pulls up on the eyelids. an identiscan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's eyes. access granted, the doors hiss open. anderson enters the building, dragging the officer with him.}
