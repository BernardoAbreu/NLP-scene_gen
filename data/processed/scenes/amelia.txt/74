<A>__{walking together down the hallway of her hotel. no one speaks. their thoughts are their own. she reaches her room, finds her key. opens the door, and... ...turns to him. a brief, direct look. she reaches one hand gently behind his head. leans up. kisses his mouth.}

<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{his eyes question.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{for understanding.}
<A>__{there is no smile. without a word, she goes into her room. closes the door behind her. he stands alone. do i knock on that door? then, smiles to himself, and simply... walks away.}
