<A>__{ray closes the door, and stands there. he seems to be having trouble breathing. he looks down at his boots. there is something on the floor. something that has been slipped under the door earlier. he just stares down at it. then slowly stoops. close on: the polaroid of the res car he gave to maggie earlier. she has returned it. he turns it over. written across the white backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name }

<A>__{ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes of files on the bed. he rummages like a nervous thief and comes up with a folder. he flips through it, casting off files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on the 8x10 black and white of richard yellow bird seen earlier. sitting in his wheelchair, red power cap on, tattoos marring big arms. and under it a double mug shot stamped leavenworth prison. under that another prison mug shot stamped sioux falls prison. and under that a third mug shot stamped "paroled." ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits on the end of the bed. he then stuffs the file back in a box, and takes off toward the door.}
