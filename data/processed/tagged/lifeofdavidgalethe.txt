<A>__{a dishevelled woman in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. she's carrying a vhs cassette. the sounds of her breathing and shoes hitting the pavement echo into the mist. she runs, and runs. she slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. she stumbles on, a final effort. she runs. sees something. stops cold.}

<A>__{a clock on the wall: 6:11. beneath the clock a simple banner reads "deathwatch austin."}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{it's probably been about seven minutes...}
<A>__{the office is small, cheaply furnished. one wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. about 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. five people wait in tense silence. a skinny college guy with a mullet and pinch of skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. a co ed cuddles a styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. a matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. the clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. constance harraway (36), bookish, sits beside david gale (31). he wears a blue yale sweatshirt. they both stare at nothing. she bites her lip.}
<C>__{college guy}
<D>__{okay. okay. we've got pronouncement. 6:12. roughly eight minutes.}
<P>__{(a beat as he records the time)}
<D>__{number 36 this year for the great state of texas.}
<A>__{they all exchange looks: they've lost. david stands.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{david, don't start throwing things.}
<A>__{a phone rings. david controls himself.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm going home. let's do the press fax tomorrow.}
<A>__{another phone rings. constance stands.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{go. i will do it.}
<A>__{he nods to her, exits. she walks to the photo wall. with a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a hispanic male. the wall clock reads 6:13.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot in front of office sunrise}
<A>__{the office is in a largely abandoned mini mall. it's going to be a clear summer day. david hurries through the empty parking lot to volvo station wagon. as the car exits the lot, we see the austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance.}

<A>__{david drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.}
<L>__{exterior intersection sunrise}
<A>__{david stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside. the cop gives him a cursory glance.}
<L>__{interior david's car sunrise}
<A>__{he stares at the cop. the cop looks neutrally ahead; behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun.}
<B>__{back to david}
<A>__{he stares, then:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the cop ignores him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yo! officer!}
<A>__{the cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation. david points to the seat belt buckle.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{your seatbelt.}
<A>__{the cop nods, weary, embarrassed. he reaches back for the belt. david takes a sip and drives on.}

<T>__{pull back to reveal we are in:}
<L>__{interior news magazine office day}
<A>__{kruger (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating low fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric massager. a name plate on her desk reads "barbara d. kruger, crime and courts editor." news magazine covers are on the walls. kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. she has half frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.}
<C>__{roberts }
<D>__{gale had sought a review of his 1993 conviction for the rape and murder of university of texas colleague, constance harraway.}
<A>__{kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip.}
<B>__{on tv}
<A>__{a book jacket photo of constance.}
<B>__{back on roberts}
<C>__{roberts }
<D>__{defense lawyers had hoped to argue that gale's former activism against capital punishment unduly prejudiced...}
<B>__{on kruger}
<A>__{she waits impatiently, munching, swallowing.}
<C>__{roberts }
<D>__{...the texas judicial system. citing 'discriminating purpose' }
<C>__{kruger}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hey, they're not gonna stay gale. it's on court tv right now, listen.}
<A>__{she holds the phone out in the direction of the tv, uses the opportunity to eat another chip.}
<B>__{on tv}
<A>__{we see old footage of david on a tv talk show.}
<C>__{roberts }
<D>__{...clear political gain in executing its leading opponent of the death penalty...}
<B>__{on kruger}
<C>__{kruger}
<P>__{(into the phone, swallowing)}
<D>__{so, what's it gonna be? belyeu said to call after the decision... no, they said only bitsey.}
<C>__{roberts }
<P>__{(in b.g.)}
<D>__{...further failed to consider that the victim was herself an abolitionist activist...}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{it means only bitsey. bill, i don't get to make the rules, i'm a fat black woman.}
<A>__{bitsey bloom (the runner from the opening) enters. she wears, as always, a tailored suit.}
<C>__{kruger}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{...what we need is to put her on a plane to houston.}
<C>__{bitsey }
<D>__{gale's going down.}
<A>__{kruger shushes her with a we know already gesture.}
<C>__{kruger}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{why do you always get lordosis around legal? she's here.}
<A>__{she puts him on speaker, and reaches for a chip.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(to the phone)}
<D>__{hi. what's lordosis?}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{female ape's posture when preparing for intercourse. hello, bitsey.}
<A>__{bitsey shoots kruger a look, mouths "you're sick."}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{look, kids, setting aside the cost issue, though half a million dollars for three two hour interviews is not only illegal it's obscen }
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{market value. guy's never talked.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{that aside, i, we are still uncomfortable with the arrangement.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{meaning you've just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{and i, we continue to appreciate your decision. we're just concerned. a rapist slash murderer, five days before he's executed, demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants. a reporter who is also a very attractive woman }
<A>__{bitsey and kruger moan in unison.}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{this is disparate treatment.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i could go if i were an ugly blabby guy?}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{there's an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male...}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{i hear lawyers gleefully saying the words bloom vs. news magazine inc.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{'well, your honor, i started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.'}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{you've gotta let her go now.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{that's not quite what i meant.}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{he's gotta let you go.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{'certain references were made '}
<C>__{bill }
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{all right. all right. enough. the intern is with you at all times?}
<A>__{bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea.}
<C>__{kruger}
<D>__{yes. i, we are hanging up. 'bye.}
<A>__{kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i'm not baby sitting.}
<A>__{kruger reaches for a chip.}
<L>__{interior rental car night}
<A>__{zack (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and looking at a case file in his lap. he holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window. zack has a bohemian grunge thing going long hair, ultra hip glasses. as bitsey drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. we hear strained patience in her voice.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{gale was seen leaving the house.}
<L>__{exterior interstate 45 night}
<A>__{the car's lights move past a sign: "huntsville 27 miles."}
<C>__{bitsey }
<D>__{his sperm was inside her.}
<L>__{interior rental car night}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{his prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag.}
<A>__{zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, hands handcuffed behind her. over her head is an opaque white plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{half a thumb printerior}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{okay, half a thumb printerior}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{could have touched it before it was a murder weapon.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{do you fondle your friends' garbage bags?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{yeah, i get very touchy around household plastics. 'hello, everybody ooooh, tupperware.' chill. i'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something.}
<A>__{she looks at him a beat.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{hey, zack?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{he did it.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{but the murder's way too fucking clumsy. and this guy's a major intellectual. top of his yale class, a rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. he's an academic stud.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{and, empirically speaking, a psychotic.}
<A>__{zack picks up another file photo: christmas shot of the gale family: david (31), his wife (sharon, beautiful, 29), and son (chase, 6).}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{look at his wife, she's a regular grace kelly. old money svelte. father was ambassador to spain }
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(looking at the car's instrument panel)}
<D>__{shit! the light's on again.}
<A>__{closeup overheat light is on.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{ignore it. it's a rental.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{thanks, zack. do you smell anything?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no. besides the guy's a flaming liberal.}
<A>__{bitsey keeps looking down at the light.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{a person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't we supposed to smell it if it's overheating?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{wrong, seventy three percent of all serial killers vote republican.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{throw the cigarette out so we can smell.}
<A>__{zack reaches for the car ashtray.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{no! you'll stink up the car. throw it out!}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{i'm not gonna fucking pollute.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{zack!}
<A>__{zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window. he shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray. she gives him a look. they ride a beat in silence. bitsey sniffs.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{we better pull off. shit, this is so irritating.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{how far to huntsville?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{she points to an approaching rest area exit sign. they share a glance, then a laugh. zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle.}
<C>__{zack}
<P>__{('hard copy' announcer's voice)}
<D>__{'news magazine reporters bitsy bloom and zack stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble...}
<L>__{exterior rest area exit night}
<A>__{the car exits for the rest area.}
<C>__{zack }
<D>__{little did they know their troubles were just beginning.}
<A>__{zack mimics the opening music to "dark shadows."}
<L>__{exterior rest area night}
<A>__{well lit and empty. the rental car is parked with the hood up. they stand looking at the radiator.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{is it hot?}
<A>__{he puts his hand on it.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{oww! jesus, yes. isn't it always?}
<A>__{bitsey shrugs.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{so what do i do?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i don't know, something male.}
<A>__{zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{bitsey's not paying attention. she's watching headlights coming toward them.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{company.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{i hope whoever it is never saw deliverance.}
<A>__{a late model pickup pulls up behind them. they shade their eyes from its headlights. the lights go off. an older cowboy (mid 60's, stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.}
<C>__{older cowboy}
<D>__{you folks need some help?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{actually yes.}
<L>__{exterior huntsville motel six night}
<A>__{the motel lies adjacent to interstate 45 and a kettle restaurant. the rental car pulls up to the reception building.}
<L>__{exterior huntsville motel six next day}
<A>__{the rental car is parked in front. the morning is overcast, it's sprinkling. bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the second floor carrying an umbrella.}
<L>__{interior kettle restaurant day}
<A>__{bitsey enters and sees zack in a booth, smoking and reading. the hyper smiley teenage hostess approaches her.}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{how are you this morning?}
<A>__{bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. she goes and sits across from zack; he's reading dialogical exhaustion by david gale.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{little early, isn't it?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{the non smoking section's over there.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i meant the book.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{9:15. the waitress says the ellis unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours. i }
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{never eat where the menus have pictures of the food.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{i was thinking we should drive to austin, check out the crime scene. could be some story stuff for us.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{first, this isn't a story. it's an interview. we come, i listen, you watch, we go home. second, there is no 'us' in the assignment.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{okay, what do i watch you do for the next five hours?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(closing the menu)}
<D>__{drive around looking for decent restaurant.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{you know, your reputation as siberian female dog person doesn't do you justice.}
<A>__{she's unsure how to interpret his comment. he smiles.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{my reputation got us invited here. i play by the rules. it's called objectivity.}
<A>__{they stare at each other. zack picks up his book, starts to read, affects a shiver.}
<L>__{exterior ellis unit drive guardhouse day}
<A>__{drizzle. the prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road. in front of the guardhouse is a sign: "tdc ellis unit. all visitors must report." superimpose: "day one" the rental car enters the frame, brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.}
<L>__{exterior ellis unit parking lot day}
<A>__{bitsey and zack get out of their car. she has an umbrella.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{so where do we report?}
<A>__{three razor wire fences surround the prison. guard towers rise at the corners. outside the fence sits a small building with a sign: "report here." bitsey makes a there you have it face. they move toward the building. someone hawks. they look over. within the fence, a skinny hispanic inmate (50's) spits. he's hunched in the rain thirty yards away. he watches them neutrally. camera tracks bitsey and zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel like pens that run along a long building. inmates watch them pass: a smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door. a muscular black man (30's) with a muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty something redneck beside him. a paunchy hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. a skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building. at the closest end of the last pen, a gang banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain link above his head. rain runs down his face.}
<L>__{interior ellis reception office}
<A>__{as bitsey and zack enter, a clean cut man in his forties is on the phone (duke grover). he waves them in and holds up a wait just a second finger.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{well, i don't rightly know one fraternity from another. but if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna arrest and prosecute... you do that, susan... bye now.}
<A>__{the office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. a portrait of governor hardin (female, mid 50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. at a desk sits a woman with texas hair (40's). grover hangs up.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{thank you, margie.}
<P>__{(turning to bitsey and zack)}

<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{stemmons.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{stemmons. sorry, won't happen again. i'm duke grover, t.d.c. community relations.}
<A>__{grover's demeanor suggests a successful little league coach, his suit suggests j.c. penny. he speaks quickly.}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{he's usually real good with names.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(to bitsey)}
<D>__{and these days i always like to ask, now do you prefer miss, mrs. or ms.?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{bitsey.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{bitsey it is. margie, i'm stealin' your umbrella.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{okey dokey.}
<L>__{exterior ellis unit entrance}
<A>__{bitsey and grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the unit gate grover walks as fast as he talks. zack follows, turns his collar up.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{bitsey, you ever been in a prison?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{zack smiles to himself.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{on death row?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{well, we house 422 inmates here. average stay with us is nine years. some get commuted, move on, most get killed. it'll put you off your supper, but then it's supposed to.}
<A>__{the unit fence gate parts as they enter. the older gate guard nods as they pass.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(to the guard)}
<D>__{afternoon, earl.}
<P>__{(back to her)}
<D>__{we've got three concerns here: safety, safety and safety. the visitation area is entirely secure we just ask you don't touch the glass. windex gets expensive.}
<A>__{they come to the door of the entrance area.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage.}
<A>__{the door buzzes, grover opens it.}
<L>__{interior ellis entrance lobby day}
<A>__{the lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines. to one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal detector. they enter and make their way toward the counter.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{this changes for no man. you're not carryin' a weapon are you?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{mr. stemmons, you packin'?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{they arrive at the counter. behind it are two guards, one male, one female.}

<P>__{(to the guards)}
<D>__{clarence. karla. new york guests for mr. gale.}
<C>__{clarence }
<D>__{may i see your purse, ma'am.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(to bitsey, indicating the metal detector)}
<D>__{go on and walk through.}
<A>__{grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and waits for her.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{now, should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area, we ask that you stay put. come on through, mr. stemmons. and please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(handing her the purse)}
<D>__{here you go, ma'am.}
<A>__{he leads them down the hall.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{anythin' you say can be overheard.}
<A>__{and any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible. not plannin' a jailbreak are you, bitsey?}
<L>__{interior ellis visitation area day}
<A>__{the door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them.}
<C>__{grover}
<D>__{here we are.}
<A>__{the visitation hall has the linoleum and fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria. it is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass. across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth. every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. on the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section. just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. this is david's lawyer, benjamin belyeu (late 30's). on the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve. above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling. the center chair is in a stainless steel cage. inside sits david gale.}
<C>__{grover}
<P>__{(calling out to belyeu)}
<D>__{all yours, mr. belyeu.}
<P>__{(to bitsey and zack)}
<D>__{you folks have safe visit now.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he exits as bitsey and zack make their way toward belyeu and david; it's a walk of about twenty five feet. belyeu's voice is a thick combination of cajun and harvard yard.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{miss bloom?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{belyeu speaks as slowly as grover did quickly. david stands up politely in his cage he's too tall and has to hunch.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{did that p.r. man validate your parkin'?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{he said the gift shop could do it.}
<A>__{belyeu laughs, smiles pure old new orleans charm.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{she's a smart one.}
<A>__{belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.}

<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{and this is the man of the hour.}
<A>__{they move toward david. a speaker system loudly (really loudly) interrupts:}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{sit down, gale.}
<A>__{all wince. david sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{now, why can't they turn that thing down?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to the microphone above him)}
<D>__{my lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker system volume.}
<A>__{a beat. they all look over at the guard's booth. one of the guards makes a get on with your business gesture.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they're practicing being cruel and unusual.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{mrs. bloom, i'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit.}
<A>__{belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two hour sessions. today, tomorrow and thursday, all at three in the p.m. i'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind.}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{you have my gregg book?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i need it for billy's appeal.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(to bitsey)}
<D>__{my client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook.}
