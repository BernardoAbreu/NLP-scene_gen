<D>__{mose! wait!...}
<A>__{he goes running, stumbling after the riders desperately calling to them...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ethan!... mose!...}
<A>__{and then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops we see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the barns and the hayricks and the house of aaron edwards. martin runs down the slope.}
<L>__{exterior yard and approach to edwards house wide angle night}
<A>__{(note to w. hoch: here again that use of red is suggested.) the angle is past the porch uprights toward mose and ethan as they ride in. little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights. a few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are burning along their shafts. beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral. there are no bodies in evidence... the red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount. ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door. he stops there and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump. slowly then and removing his hat he goes in. mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief. we hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and ethan's muffled voice calling through the house:}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{lucy?... deborah? lucy?}
<A>__{he strides back through the main room and out onto the porch just as martin comes at a shambling run across the yard. ethan takes a few steps out toward him. martin would pass him, but ethan grabs his arm.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(harshly)}
<D>__{you stay out!}
<A>__{martin tries to fight his arm free.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{nothing for you to see.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{leggo...}
<A>__{ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. martin goes down out cold. and only now do we understand how merciful the blow was as ethan looks compassionately at the fallen figure.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{don't let him go in there, mose...}
<A>__{and he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop.}
