<L>__{interior foyer night}
<A>__{drew is putting on his coat, susan with him, a tension between them, a heavy silence finally broken.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...see you tomorrow night.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{include me out. i've had enough of the conversations.}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{daddy'll do fine. besides, he's got joe.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{and so do you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{drew, you're out of line.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that may be. but i don't like the fucker. i don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you. and vice versa.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sorry, but i like the way he looks and talks to me. and vice versa. okay?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no, not okay. i thought we had a good thing going here.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{it shows you never know.}
<A>__{silence, neither knows how to continue.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well... goodnight.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah. goodnight.}
<A>__{drew goes, susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer, he's been observing them. she walks up to him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{how long have you been standing there?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't like the way drew spoken to you. but i feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{tell me about yourself, joe. who you are. what you're doing with my father.}
<A>__{susan's directness has caught him by surprise, joe blinks.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{so you're not going to tell me?}
<A>__{joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by susan's inquiries.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you're married, aren't you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.}
<A>__{joe doesn't respond.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{so you are married.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{girlfriend?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{gay?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{susan comes closer to joe.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then tell me, joe, how come a man as attractive, intelligent, well spoken ,diffident in the most sed uctive way, and yet powerful, is all alone in this world?}
<A>__{joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by susan.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't want to pry and you don't want to tell me. so let's leave it a mystery. that's the way you want it, isn't it?}
<A>__{susan takes another step closer to joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you, i appreciate that.}
<A>__{they are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now joe turns to head up the stairs.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{to bed.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(suddenly fragile)}
<D>__{'to bed'?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes. i'm tired.}
<A>__{he excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the stairs, susan watches him disappear. she turns back into the salon just as allison and quince are exiting, "good byes" all around. susan is left alone now with parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that was wonderful.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yeah, it's good to get together.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{do you mind if i raise a little caution flag?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{raise away.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is the nature of your interest in joe?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"? the nature of it's in there somewhere.}
<A>__{parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his time before answering.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then what will you say?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. drew's a good man. i know i didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but i've come to appreciate }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{now we love drew and joe in verbo ten? what's going on?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{when you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's something.}
<A>__{she kisses him.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{g'night, daddy. see you tomorrow. this is getting interesting.}
<A>__{she goes.}
