<A>__{j.j. has not moved; he is thoughtful and morose. nikko, the japanese butler, comes in to remove the breakfast table.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{the table can wait. no calls. i have to think about my tv show.}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{pleased to do. i will come back later.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds?}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{yes, but they don't come no more this time of year.}
<A>__{smiling, nikko leaves. hunsecker picks up a pencil and makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt. abruptly he looks up, calling:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie! come in a minute, dear...}
<A>__{she has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room. she comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary. his act is one of a tasteful mammy singer, but he is watchful, too.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{what a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{did sidney tell you about it?}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{yes, he phoned. i don't know this boy too well. anything in these charges?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{not being partial, are you?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(with quiet certainty)}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i'm not!}
<A>__{he soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie, take it easy. i will trust your judgment you don't have to protest with me.}
<A>__{with a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms, inviting her into his comforting embrace. not wanting to, she walks into his open waiting arms.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{why are you trembling, dear...?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{history repeats itself. everything that happened to alan leslie...began with a smear like this...}
<A>__{hunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and troubling thought.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{she leaves his arms; he watches keenly.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(incoherent)}
<D>__{it's just as if i've seen a ghost today...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{but that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to leslie. i've told you that a million times...}
<A>__{he goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then whose fault was it, j.j.? it was someone's fault, wasn't it?}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{i wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(stronger)}
<D>__{alan was not...unbalanced when i married him. and he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i'm not fighting with you, puss...}
<A>__{she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he never would have killed himself if i hadn't gone through with the annulment. don't you see that made all the rumors seem true? i should have stood up for him...not run out.}
<A>__{she turns to hunsecker, her manner firmer.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{j.j., i want you to get them back their job, steve and the quintet.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{("incredulously")}
<D>__{you mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?}
<A>__{he walks away with a wag of indignation, but turns, asking:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke?}
<A>__{susan shakes her head emphatically.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{i know steve. no.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(involuntarily)}
<D>__{sidney is a liar!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{who said sidney?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(defiantly)}
<D>__{i said sidney!...}
<A>__{staring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{you know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and i, and i don't like that.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i thought we were talking about sidney?}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(with rasp)}
<D>__{let me finish, dear. you had your say, now let me have mine...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i haven't said anything yet, j.j., but if }
<A>__{susan hesitates. hunsecker waits for her to continue. but she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she means to make. she turns away.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i started to say we're drifting apart. a year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? today i had to call you in!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm taking up the situation with you now...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{susie, i want to help you , there's nothing i won't do for you. you're all i've got in the whole, wide world.}
<A>__{hunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, what have i got? alimony to a pair of tramps? they're of no concern to me. it's you who count, but don't get me wrong i don't intend to let you break your neck again!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{j.j., you said you want to help me prove it!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{get steve back his job...please...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{he means that much to you...?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{with your "prestige" it only takes a minute ten cents worth of american tel and tel.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{you're picking up my lingo, hon.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(levelly)}
<D>__{i read your column every day...}
<A>__{he looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some real interest. her level, straightforward manner has pinned him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he goes for a private phone book:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie, i like this new attitude of yours. you're growing up and i like it! i don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, i won't...}
<A>__{he crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a moment:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{this dallas boy must be good for you. why not bring him around today, before the show? this time i will clean my glasses for a better look.}
<A>__{susan doesn't like this idea, is evasive:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm not sure i can reach him in time.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{sure you can if you want to, and i know you'll want to...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{by the way, what's your beef against little sidney?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(steadily)}
<D>__{when i'm certain, i will let you know...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{a man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{let me have billy van cleve...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{don't ever tell anyone, susie, how i'm tied to your apron strings...}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{billy! j.j.! what's this about that boy? what boy? where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? you're brain is warming up, sweetheart yeah, dallas!...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{no, don't explain your point of view, but...}
