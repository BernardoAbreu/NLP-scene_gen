<L>__{interior dining saloon}
<B>__{close on ruth.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{tell us of the accommodations in steerage, mr. dawson. i hear they're quite good on this ship. wider: the table. jack is seated opposite rose, who is flanked by cal and thomas andrews. also at the table are molly brown, ismay, colonel gracie, the countess, guggenheim, madame aubert, and the astors.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{the best i've seen, m'am. hardly any rats. rose motions surreptitiously for jack to take his napkin off his plate.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{mr. dawson is joining us from third class. he was of some assistance to my fiancee last night.}
<P>__{(to jack, as if to a child)}
<A>__{this is foie gras. it's goose liver. we see whispers exchanged. jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.}
<C>__{guggenheim}
<P>__{(low to madame aubert)}
<A>__{what is hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here?}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<A>__{how do you take your caviar, sir?}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(answering for him)}
<A>__{just a soupcon of lemon...}
<P>__{(to jack, smiling)}
<A>__{...it improves the flavor with champagne.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<A>__{no caviar for me, thanks.}
<P>__{(to cal)}
<A>__{never did like it much. he looks at rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{and where exactly do you live, mr. dawson?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{well, right now my address is the rms titanic. after that, i'm on god's good humor. salad is served. jack reaches for the fish fork. rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. he changes forks.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{you find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{well... it's a big world, and i want to see it all before i go. my father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. he died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. you can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt nexterior see, my folks died in a fire when i was fifteen, and i've been on the road since. somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. to make each day count. molly brown raises her glass in a salute.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{well said, jack.}
<C>__{colonel gracie}
<P>__{(raising his glass)}
<A>__{here, here. rose raises her glass, looking at jack.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{to making it count. ruth, annoyed that jack has scored a point, presses him further.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{how is it you have the means to travel, mr. dawson?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{i work my way from place to place. tramp steamers and such. i won my ticket on titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.}
<P>__{(he glances at rose)}
<A>__{a very lucky hand.}
<C>__{gracie}
<A>__{all life is a game of luck.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{a real man makes his own luck, archie. rose notices that thomas andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his notebook, completely ignoring the conversation.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{mr. andrews, what are you doing? i see you everywhere writing in this little book.}
<P>__{(grabs it and reads)}
<A>__{increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. you build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you?! andrews smiles sheepishly.}
<C>__{ismay}
<A>__{he knows every rivet in her, don't you thomas?}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{all three million of them.}
<C>__{ismay}
<A>__{his blood and soul are in the ship. she may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of god she belongs to thomas andrews.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{your ship is a wonder, mr. andrews. truly.}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{thankyou, rose. we see that andrews has come under rose's spell.}
