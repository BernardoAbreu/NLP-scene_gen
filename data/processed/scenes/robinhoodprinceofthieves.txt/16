<L>__{exterior locksley castle night}
<A>__{ruins. the moon hovers ominously over the once proud castle. burned to the ground. gutted and deserted. towers demolished. moat drained. robin stares, struck dumb with horror. the dark courtyard. heartsick, robin stumbles over debris.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{father! hello!}
<A>__{his voice echoes around the fallen battlements. aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points... suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse. close medallion round the corpse's neck. the locksley crest.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{a paroxysm of rage and grief. he smashes furniture. slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. pained, aslan looks on.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i should have been here.}
<A>__{spent, he leans against the wall. in the silence, they hear an eerie tapping. robin draws his sword... a hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... duncan.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(shaking him)}
<D>__{damn you, duncan. why didn't you cut him down?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{master robin, is it you? a miracle. i thought god had abandoned us.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{easy... look at him.}
<A>__{duncan steps into the moonlight. his face crudely scarred.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what has happened?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{they say they captured him worshipping with the druids. he signed a confession before the bishop of hereford.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{did they have witnesses?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{just one. kenneth of cowfall. the bishop decreed all the locksley lands forfeit.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{did you believe the charges?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{not even when they took my eyes.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{who did this to you, duncan?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{guy of gisborne. with the sheriff looking on.}
<A>__{robin holds the old retainer to his chest. stares into the night in silent rage.}
