<A>__{porthole view exterior interior officers' mess "daddy" seen through the thick plexi porthole, heavily clothed veterans are struggling with a wall, trying to erect the pre fab unit while the wind, inaudible inside the ship, rages around them, staggering them this way and that. what we hear in the quiet interior of the mess is church voicing his disbelief.}
<C>__{church }
<D>__{a "growl"! he heard a growl?}
<A>__{rubrick, looking uneasy, is facing church who's looking up at him from a game of solitaire at the little table. sloan is biting her fingernails in the b.g.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{well, he didn't say the word "growl." he said a "throat noise," but i asked him to imitate it and it sounded like a growl to me.}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{my god! who are we fighting here!}
<C>__{rubrick}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i think...i think we have to assume the missing men are...down.}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(getting up, pacing)}
<D>__{i knew mekum's hotshots were green. no reinforcements, then they walk right into an enemy stronghold.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{we could send reinforcements now...}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{absolutely not. those bastards are just waiting in there for us. no more of this fancy super soldier shit. we do it with the hammer...}
<A>__{rubrick and sloan exchange a nervous glance as church paces agitatedly.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{uh, what does that mean, "the hammer"?}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(suddenly smug)}
<D>__{my daddy always said, "when you want to insert a nail in a piece of wood, you don't do nothing fancy or glamorous, you don't finesse or play the hero, you just pick up your damn hammer and hit that sumbitch till it's in."}
<C>__{sloan}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{christ! now daddy's a carpenter!}
<C>__{rubrick}
<P>__{(to church)}
<D>__{i...don't...quite...follow...sir.}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(decisive, sharp)}
<D>__{take the whole unit, both crawlers, and tell 'em to pound that place with rockets, cannons, mortars, everything we got...from a safe distance.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{raw firepower!}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{it may not be heroic, and we may waste some ammo, but by god we'll get the job done.}
