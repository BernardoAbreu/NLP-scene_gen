<D>__{all right. john, would you lead the class, please?}
<A>__{the children walk two by two to the corridor door. john opens it, and they begin filing out. melanie turns to look at the play yard. close shot a single crow fluttering at the window, almost in exploration. he hangs there for a moment, then wings back to the playground equipment. close shot melanie}
