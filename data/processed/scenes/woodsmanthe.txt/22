<L>__{interior office night}
<A>__{walter sits in a small windowless office with his coat still on. he looks at someone off screen.}

<D>__{i'm adjusting okay.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{and your new apartment?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{apartment's okay.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{are you taking your medication?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it gives me headaches.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{but you are taking it?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{across from walter, sits rosen, young, awkward and clearly new to the profession, jotting something down in a notepad.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{good. i will talk to your physician about the headaches. maybe he can change the prescription.}
<A>__{walter doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{rosen }
<D>__{and how's your job?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{the job's okay.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{do i take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i said the job is okay.}
<C>__{rosen}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that's right, you did.}
<P>__{pause)}
<D>__{have you made any friends there?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm not running for mr. popularity.}
<C>__{rosen}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you seem a little hostile today.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that was a joke.}
<A>__{rosen jots something on his notepad. walter reaches over and taps on the notebook.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{it's called sarcasm, dr. rosen.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{no need to call me doctor. i'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's all the same.}
<A>__{rosen looks at walter for a long moment. walter avoids his gaze.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{walter, i'd like you to try something for me.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{i'd like you to keep a journal.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{a diary?}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{diaries have sent too many guys to prison.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{ev i dence.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{oh. it never crossed my mind.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{it was just an idea.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{bad idea.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{reflect.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you think reflection is good.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{it's very good, indeed.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.}
<A>__{walter looks at him flatly.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you read that in a book.}
<A>__{rosen blushes.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{try it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no fucking way.}
<C>__{rosen}
<D>__{then think about it.}
<A>__{walter is silent.}
