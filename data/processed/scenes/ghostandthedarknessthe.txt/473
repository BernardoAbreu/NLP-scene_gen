<A>__{patterson. and he does move. slowly. carefully. into the chaos. he stares around the dead and the dying are everywhere. hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone. all that's left now is this: the sound of pain.}

<A>__{dust rises. it covers everything. only the sound remains. now different sounds take over an incredible babble of human voices.}
<B>__{and a railroad train.}
<A>__{patterson walks through the dust. samuel, a worried look on his face, is a few steps behind. we are at the station area and it is jammed. a train has pulled into the station only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber up onto the roofs of the cars covering the cars everyone is leaving patterson can only watch. abdullah stands on one of the cars the train begins to pull out of the station. more and more workers chase after it, get pulled on. now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full. patterson still watches, eyes vacant. abdullah sees him, looks away. the train gathers speed. rounds a corner... ...gone... patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. samuel stays close behind him, the worried look still there.}
