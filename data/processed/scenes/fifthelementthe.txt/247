<A>__{korben blows on the stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside. a yellow beam pops up like a ray of sunlight, like korben's smile.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{quickly, everyone on a stone! water for water! fire for fire! earth for earth!}
<A>__{the two men move fast. korben on the 4th stone: earth. he grabs a fistful of earth and throws it on the stone. a miniature patch of green appears and immediately forms a green beam. cornelius wipes his forehead with a scarf and wrings it out over the stone. it opens revealing a patch of miniature raging sea. a blue beam appears. loc rhod has a problem.}

<C>__{korben}
<D>__{don't breathe.}
<A>__{loc rhod and cornelius hold their breath. korben strikes the match. a small flame appears on the tip. a breeze goes through the room. korben feels like he's got tnt in his hands. he approaches the flame to the stone. the flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on. the stone opens. a patch of miniature fire appears. korben sighs, snuffs out the match. the fourth beam, a red one, immediately forms.}
