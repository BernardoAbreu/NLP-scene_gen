<L>__{interior wills' living room night}
<A>__{the room is empty. there's laughter in the distance. the front door opens and shuts. we hear wills and charlotte, both a little tipsy, advancing down the hall toward us }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{god, you talk like you're a hundred and sixteen!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that's usually how i feel. but not tonight. tonight i feel sixteen... just sixteen... and three quarters.}
<A>__{wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls out a bottle of champagne already sitting in an ice bucket.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{champagne?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{he asked nonchalantly.}
<A>__{wills laughs, then opens the bottle as he picks up his previous train of thought }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you see, charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. people start falling into types. pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. and if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. and the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right.}
<P>__{(popping the cork)}
<D>__{now, what i like about you and i think that's actually what inspired this little lecture is that i find you completely unprecedented... and, therefore, wholly unpredictable.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{god, it must be a relief.}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{to finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to her.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{now wait a minute.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, because coincidentally i am all those things you just said. and more.}
<A>__{wills chuckles, shaking his head, charmed but a little unsettled.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i'm a "unique". at least that's what my yoga teacher says. he says there are very few uniques in the world and i'm one of them.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{well, he's a wise man.}
<A>__{he hands her a glass of champagne.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you, on the other hand, are what he'd call a "typical."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh huh. and i can prove it. want me to? come here.}
<A>__{wills moves a few steps closer.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{closer.}
<A>__{wills walks even closer, until they are just a few feet apart.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, come on, really close.}
<A>__{wills can't believe his good luck. he nears her until their faces are almost touching.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{perfect. now watch very carefully.}
<A>__{she rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from his. their breathing mingles. wills seems almost dizzied by it. and then, very slowly, he kisses her. she does not kiss back. finally, he pulls away, staring blankly, breathing hard, not sure what to say. charlotte whispers }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{see? you're a typical.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and for what you just did, most girls my age would slap your face. or ask to be put in a cab.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{lucky for you, i'm a unique.}
<A>__{she smiles, then kisses him deeply on the mouth. her arms wrap around his neck.}
