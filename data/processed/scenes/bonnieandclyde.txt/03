<A>__{over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage connected to the house. there is an old car parked in the driveway, its windows open. we see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively. he is a rather dapper fellow, dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater. it is clyde barrow. obviously, he is about to steal the car. he looks it over, checking around him to make sure no passers by are coming. he peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition. he studies the dashboard. bonnie continues watching, silently. finally she calls out.}
