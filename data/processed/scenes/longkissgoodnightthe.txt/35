<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. henessey, i'm a little on edge.}
<A>__{she pauses. surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in her eye... says softly:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i can feel her. like a ghost.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we could walk away, you know. there's still time, we could just... leave her dead.}
<A>__{she hefts a suitcase onto a bench. opens it draws a sharp breath:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{ay i yi!}
<A>__{clothes to kill for. smooth velvet. creamy silk. the finest, the best. the sexiest. sam peeks at the tags:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{size four, no way. you know how long it's been since i could wear a size four?}

<D>__{anything else in there?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{hmm...? uh, no. just... more clothes.}
