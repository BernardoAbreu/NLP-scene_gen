<D>__{oh, no, of course not.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses. but, it's been so long since we've seen each other.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{of course. you're right. besides, we should be talking about your engagement.}
<A>__{they start walking again.}
<C>__{letty}
