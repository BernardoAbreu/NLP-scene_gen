<A>__{pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the steinway grand. there's a bank of silver framed photos on top. he pauses to take a proper look at them. his and alma's life together in movies. smiling at premieres with cary grant and grace kelly. on vacation with jimmy and gloria stewart. at a black tie event with ingrid bergman and gregory peck. but it's the photograph tucked away at the back that he wants to see most. a black and white publicity still taken on the set of the mountain eagle in 1926. he picks it up and looks at it: the young hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling "action!" on his first film. his eyes don't have to move far to find alma, standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face. they look so young... hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful hitch's pov. it's snowing outside.}
