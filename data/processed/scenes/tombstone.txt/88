<A>__{curly bill fires again. wyatt's hat flies off. he fires again, digging a gash in wyatt's boot heel. now curly bill takes dead aim with his .45 and click it's empty. he tosses it aside. suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances. eyes wild with battle rage, curly bill quickly raises his shotgun.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{die! son of a bitch! die!}
<A>__{he fires. wyatt's coattails evaporate into swirling shreds as he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing through clenched teeth:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{and with that, wyatt lets go with both barrels. curly bill's mid section vaporizes, the huge double charge of buckshot ripping him completely in half. the other cowboys flinch as they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore. barnes screams:}
