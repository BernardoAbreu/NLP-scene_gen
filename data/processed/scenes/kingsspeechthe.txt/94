<L>__{interior archbishop of canterbury's screening room new day}
<A>__{on the screen: archive footage of the coronation, capturing the pomp and ceremony. cigar smoke rises up. the voices of churchill and lang can be heard.}
<C>__{cosmo lang }
<D>__{i was much moved}
<C>__{winston churchill }
<D>__{there were tears in my eyes too, your grace, particularly when i saw you and the dean of westminster cannoning into each other.}
<C>__{cosmo lang }
<D>__{that's been edited.}
<C>__{winston churchill }
<D>__{more tears when our new monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the bishops treading on his robe.}
<C>__{cosmo lang }
<D>__{to the world, all went splendidly.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms.}
<A>__{the footage freezes momentarily.}
<C>__{cosmo lang }
<D>__{now, winston, i have something which will bring tears to your eyes.}
<A>__{the archive footage continues, but it is not of the coronation. david and wallis visiting the fuhrer in germany: hitler gallantly kissing mrs simpson's hand while goring and the duke of windsor beam; david giving the nazi salute. freeze frame. the lights come on. for once, churchill is speechless.}
<C>__{cosmo lang }
<D>__{there's no doubt: david is planning a comeback. and will succeed if our king continues to falter. though bertie miraculously survived the coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed. soon he must broadcast to the world. hitler will be listening. david will be listening. stalin and roosevelt will be listening. everyone will be listening. god help us.}
