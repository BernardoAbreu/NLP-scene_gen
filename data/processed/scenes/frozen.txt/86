<A>__{lynch holds his head.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{alright. hold on.}
<A>__{once again, lynch starts looking all around. above, below.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{maybe...if i could climb up to the lift cable? maybe i could like, scale across to the other chairs until i find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you think you can pull yourself across that many chairs?}
<A>__{lynch looks back at her.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i can't even do a pull up.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{you never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. you had your mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{there was no reason to embarrass myself. i knew i couldn't do it.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{you can too. remember jenny bluth? she fucking did it. you can do it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{even if i made it across to the next chair...how many more would it take before i found one closer to the ground?}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{every lift pole has an emergency ladder on it.}
<A>__{they look forwards and backwards. the chair behind them is not near the pole. but the one behind that one is.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ok. the chair that's two back. does it look like it's near the pole?}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i don't know. i can't see.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shit, that's far.}
<A>__{he and parker just stare at it.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{just. just give me a second.}
<A>__{he starts taking deep breaths. trying to psyche himself up.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what if you fall, too?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here. maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know?}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{what's going on up there? you guys?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we're right here, baby.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, man. we didn't go anywhere. i think...i think i'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. if the chair is close enough, maybe... maybe i can jump to it.}
