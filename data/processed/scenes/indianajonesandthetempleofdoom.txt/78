<L>__{59. interior pankot palace afternoon}
<A>__{they walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with pieces of mirror and semi precious stones. fountains spray in ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour. as willie walks with shorty she appraises the chronolgoical portraits of the pankot prices that line the hall. dissipated faces, elegant faces, evil faces she reacts to them.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to short round)}
<D>__{how'd you like to run into him in a dark alley...that one's kind of cute...i could see myself married to a prince like that...}
<A>__{ahead of them chattar lal walks with indy and questions him suspiciously }
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{the plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you should have been there...}
<C>__{indiana}

<D>__{i am only his humble servant, but the maharajah usually listens to my advice.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{is that him?}

<C>__{willie }
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{he's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{no, no, that is uhmed singh, the present maharajah's late father.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh good. and maybe the pres ent marahajah is a little younger? and thinner?}
<A>__{two female servants approach silently and bow.}
