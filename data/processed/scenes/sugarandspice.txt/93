<L>__{exterior football field night}
<B>__{on crowd}
<A>__{as they turn flash cards in unison to read: "2 4 6 8 logs are rollin' on the state!"}
<B>__{on squad}
<A>__{going nuts! they notice diane isn't there. she's eating a vendor's box. they run over to her.}
<B>__{on jack}
<A>__{running for a touchdown a la his homecoming run. this time he's exhausted and the competition is gaining. everything grinds to a slo mo crawl as jack makes a heroic leap for the touchdown. with his spare hand, he attempts to smother a huge yawn, as opposing players come flying at him from both sides.}
