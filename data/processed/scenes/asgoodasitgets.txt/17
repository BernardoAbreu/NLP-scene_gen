<L>__{interior simon's apartment studio (minutes later)}
<A>__{vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{exactly what is your previous experience?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how about that pose?}
<P>__{(sing song)}
<D>__{this is not fun...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{give me some direction.}
<A>__{vincent has instinctively put simon on the defensive. he tries not to show it.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{nothing. i just watch till something strikes me. do anything you think of try different thing. until i say, "hold that pose." then just try and comfortably hold it.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(trying another space)}
<D>__{the fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means i haven't done it right... is that correct? i haven't done it right?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no... okay. what i do is watch and wait for, um... you ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? they are just sort of realer and more alive. and when you notice it so are you. if you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.}
<A>__{vincent's slack jawed expression changes. he feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i know exactly what you mean.}
<A>__{there's a joy in him at this moment a bit of purity.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{vincent does so hums a bit of "satisfaction" to celebrate.}
