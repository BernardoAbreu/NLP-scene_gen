<A>__{it is five minutes later. dussander stands in the uniform. he looks at it indignantly.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{the insignia is all wrong. the boots should be leather, not imitation.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that suit cost me over eighty bucks... with the boots.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{and this material... what? polyester?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{quiet. straighten that hat.}
<A>__{dussander ignores him.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{straighten that hat, soldier!}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{good gott .}
<A>__{dussander does what he is told.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{actung!}
<A>__{slowly dussander straightens up.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{now, march... do it!}
<A>__{dussander begins to move his feet in place.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{that's it. march.}
<A>__{dussander has gotten into a rhythm, marching faster in place.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{about face.}
<A>__{dussander spins sharply on his heels. he continues to march.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{about face.}
<A>__{dussander is stomping in place vigorously. he spins on command, facing todd. he gives a nazi salute. todd watches him march for a moment. at first he enjoys the domination, but as dussander gets caught up in the marching, todd's expression changes.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{okay, that's enough.}
<A>__{dussander is still marching furiously.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i said that's enough!}
<A>__{suddenly dussander stops. he collapses into a chair, exhausted. he sits there panting for a moment.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy... be careful. you play with fire.}
<A>__{dussander's dream #2 : interior dussander's bedroom night dussander wakes to a strange, faint rumble. he climbs out of bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound. we follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed. soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his room. yet he is still in darkness, as if his room has suddenly ended and continues into a black void. but the rumble gets louder, more mechanical sounding. as the sound crescendoes we see what dussander sees. a train car. steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a complete stop in the night. dussander stares at the boxcar coldly, and we realize that something is staring back at him. eyes, dozens of them, glare back at him from between the slatted boards of the train. some are low to the flooe, like those of children. others are higher. dussander snaps at them in german.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{come out. ...come out, now!}
<A>__{no one exits the train. yet, the eyes seem to move around cautiously within the boxcar. dussander is getting angry. his orders aren't being carried out. suddenly the door of the train slides open. but still only the eyes are visible.}
<C>__{dussander }
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{line up in front of the train. now!}
<A>__{again, no one gets off. enraged, dussander takes a few steps toward the train. in a flash the eyes charge at him. but these are not the eyes of prisoners. these are wolves. dussander can only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend upon him.}
