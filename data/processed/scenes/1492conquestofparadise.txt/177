<A>__{columbus is shown into the room. isabel is waiting for him. he drops to his knees before her. this time she walks towards him, clearly moved by his white hair, and other signs of physical deterioration. her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console him. her hand is dying to comfort. but instead, she offers her hand for him to kiss.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{rise... please...}
<A>__{columbus gets slowly to his feet but his eyes, as they meet hers, are as clear as before. isabel smiles with relief to see it. he looks back at her.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{now i do look older than you.}
<A>__{she smiles then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps her dignity.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{we have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world...}
<A>__{columbus starts to interrupt; she stops him with a gesture.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{but without your brothers. nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies. you may explore the continent.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{there is one thing i'd like to understand... why do you want to go back, after all this?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{your majesty some men are content to read about things. i must see them with my own eyes. i cannot be other than i am.}
<A>__{she almost bursts out laughing only pauses, turns slightly, then goes out.}
