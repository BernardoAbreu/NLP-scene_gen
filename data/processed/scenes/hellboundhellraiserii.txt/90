<L>__{interior blood boudoir day}
<A>__{kirsty is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood. this room too is now suffused with blue light and smoke. there are no gateways to hell in the walls but there are several cracks in the plaster and these appear to be spreading. kirsty moans and opens her eyes gingerly. she puts a hand to her face, rubbing at the place where julia hit her. still a little groggy, she lifts herself slowly to a sitting position, her legs stretched out. only when she has blinked a few times, shaken her head, and rubbed her jaw again, does full consciousness return at which point she looks quickly about the room ( possibly expecting another attack from julia) and notices the light and the smoke. she has been in this atmosphere before. she knows precisely what it means. her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous again.}

<D>__{oh, shit.}
