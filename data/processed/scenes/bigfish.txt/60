<L>__{exterior dirt road day}
<A>__{the road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. the sun is still shining, and the birds still chirping. spinning the key to the city, edward whistles, because it's a day meant for whistling.}
<L>__{exterior further along rough path}
<A>__{the road has narrowed to a rough path. spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. still, edward whistles. coming around a bend, his pitch drops as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path. he stops. for the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing. the forest is dead quiet. he looks back the way he came. it's tempting to go back. it would be easier to go back. but edward presses on. he carefully steps through the thorns. his trouser legs catch on the barbs. we can hear the fabric tear.}
<B>__{further along}
<A>__{a scratched and sweaty edward waves off various stinging bugs flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them. just then a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you stupid sonofa...}
<A>__{he stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. the stone ricochets off a tree and into a bee's nest. the swarm roars out. edward high tails it, each step still precarious.}
