<L>__{interior karen's apartment building, hallway day}
<A>__{the elevator doors open. karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself in a deserted hallway. she looks back then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! as karen raises the canister of mace the trio turn and head down to the right. karen breathes a sigh of relief, shakes her head.}
<L>__{interior karen's apartment day}
<A>__{karen enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. she picks up the phone, dials 911 }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i need the police. this is an emergency }
<A>__{as karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and checks the locks then the windows, then the fire escape finally, a voice comes on the other end.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{hello? my name is karen jansen, i was with curtis webb at mid town hospital last night that's right, i witnessed the attack }
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{115 aurora, apartment 3g. yes, i will wait here. please hurry.}
<A>__{karen hangs up the phone and turns }
<B>__{a shaft of bright sunlight}
<A>__{streams in through a window. karen forces herself to look at it and winces, shielding her eyes. again, she brings a hand to the bandaged wound on her neck. she moves to the window, pulling the shade down, frightened.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{get a grip on yourself, girl.}
<A>__{she sinks down into a chair to wait, setting whistler's vampire mace aside. then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. we see }
<B>__{a brief flash of}
<A>__{quinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. his pupils pulsating hypnotically. we rush into his gaping maw and wham! we're back to reality. karen wakes with a start, looks to the windows time has passed, it's getting dark outside and someone is knocking at the front door. karen reaches for the vampire mace, then moves to the door. she looks through the peephole, cautious }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{karen's pov (fish eye) a police officer stands in the hallway 30s, handsome, a knight in shining armor as far as she's concerned.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{sergeant gideon. i'm responding to a 911 call.}
<A>__{karen visibly relaxes. she opens the door and steps aside, allowing gideon to enter.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes, that was me, i'm karen jansen }
<A>__{gideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies karen's face, the bandages on her neck.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<P>__{(off karen's nod)}
<D>__{i'm glad you called, ms. jansen, we've been anxious to get a hold of you. you disappeared on us for a while.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i know. listen do you have any idea what happened to curtis, the other doctor?}
<C>__{gideon}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{oh, he's dead. but i wouldn't worry about that if i were you.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{gideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{because you're dead too.}
<A>__{karen gasps. she has a half second to act in which she triggers a spray of vampire mace into gideon's face. gideon stumbles back, blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes karen expects pyrotechnics but the end result is little more than an annoyance. a second later, gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his fingers, confused }
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{garlic?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he said it would work against vampires }
<A>__{gideon bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{who said i was a vampire?}
<A>__{gideon shakes his head, still snickering. he forces karen against the wall, placing the gun against her head }
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{thanks for the laugh. you can shut your eyes if you want to.}
<A>__{crash!!! the front door explodes open as blade comes flying through it! gideon tries to bring his pistol up but blade grips the man's hand and squeezes. gideon screams as his bones snap like kindling. the pistol falls from his grasp blade fires his fist into gideon's gut again and again, then flings the officer across the room, sending him smashing into a glass cased cabinet. bleeding, battered, gideon struggles to stand blade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he sinks to the floor in a half conscious haze. blade stands over gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. finally, he looks to karen }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{karen nods, glances at gideon }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{figured they'd send someone after you. thought i'd wait around and see who showed up.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you used me as bait?!}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{it worked, didn't it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but, he could've }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he didn't. get over it.}
<A>__{blade kneels next to gideon. he turns the man's head, inspects the neck, the skin behind the ear }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but he's a policeman }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he's a familiar. a human who works for the vampires. see this mark?}
<A>__{blade pushes aside gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol tattooed into the man's scalp.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{that's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. that means officer friendly here is someone's property. any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to friendly's owner }
<P>__{(studying the glyph)}
<D>__{this glyph belongs to deacon frost. we've been tracking him for a while now }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why in god's name would anyone want to work for them?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{because they're vampire wanna bes. if they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and that's a good thing?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{for some. live forever, never get old. the ultimate high.}
<A>__{just then, gideon moans. blade drags the man up so they're eye to eye.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how 'bout you, officer? you a good little bloodhound?}
