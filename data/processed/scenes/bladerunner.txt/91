<D>__{could you tell me where the bathroom is?}
<A>__{styles doesn't get a chance to answer. batty's hand has torn into his crotch. the man is lifted off the floor, up the wall and held a moment. whatever is encased in his pelvis is pulverized. batty lets go. styles hits the floor. he died of shock. grinding his teeth, batty continues towards the sounds of the festivities.}
