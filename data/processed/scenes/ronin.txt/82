<A>__{edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of them, including the dad we saw earlier. seconds later, edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now vincent and sam meet in the middle of the crowd. there is time for a quick beat, while vincent glares at sam.}

<A>__{and now sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow sam into the tunnels it's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena. except that everything here is made of stone and the only light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide just barely enough light for us to see. now we do a series of quick cuts sam running, followed by vincent, while edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a dead end. he turns around, looking for a way out as gregor sees the final exit ahead of him as we go out in the street larry is still behind the wheel of the citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that the watches is almost on him, and now we're back in the tunnels deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost reached the exit as out in the street gregor hits the street running. he doesn't notice the citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but as he runs by the car door swings open and gregor runs straight into it. he smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured. strong hands reach out of the car and pull him in. it's the watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one: seamus reilly. seated in the front seat is a very dead larry. seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.}
