<A>__{miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall still making sure she isn't dreaming this. she looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily. nobody there. but when she looks down the other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. so quick we're not sure we saw it for sure. miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction. at night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling quality. she silently strolls down the hall, tilting her head at the various sounds from patients in their cells. she turns to make sure rachel isn't behind her and when miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing right across from: the nurses' station where two nurses are watching television. miranda tiptoes past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.}
<B>__{another corridor}
<A>__{this one is wider. miranda is startled by the sudden sound of laughter behind her. the nurses laughing at their late night show. momentarily distracted, she almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall. she holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a}
<B>__{sanitation closet.}
<A>__{she looks for something, a tool. discards a pair of brushes and finds a small screwdriver. pockets it.}
<B>__{the stairs}
<A>__{miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay clear from the surveillance camera sweeping the area. she waits at the landing, times it just right and scurries to the next floor.}
