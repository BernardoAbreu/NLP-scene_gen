<A>__{silhouetted against the aurora borealis. the horizon swirls mysteriously with color and light. distant slivers of lightning kiss the earth. men keep watch in furtive groups, huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows of vapor. a massive crackling is heard. a young sailor spins, jumpy.}
<C>__{old sailor}
<D>__{only the ice to starboard, boy.}
<C>__{young sailor}
<D>__{is it breaking up?}
<C>__{old sailor}
<D>__{just dancing on the current. it'll freeze even tighter come next wind.}
<A>__{camera drifts past to another group:}
<D>__{sailor #4 it was a polar bear. that's what i say. sailor #5 say all you want, but you weren't there. it left human tracks. sailor #6 no man could tear those dogs apart. sailor #5 no human. we've roused a demon from the ice.}
<A>__{clang clang! the men spin. a sailor on starboard has rung the signal bell. the men race over, crowding the gunwale.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{something. in the mist.}
<A>__{walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, rifle aimed at the sky. the men wait. holding their breath. scanning the darkness. an apparition looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. the figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.}
<C>__{young sailor}
<D>__{it's the demon! shoot while you've a chance!}
<A>__{the pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box spotlight and swings it around. the beam seeks out the specter and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions with frozen leather straps, dead dogs lie in icy heaps around him.}
