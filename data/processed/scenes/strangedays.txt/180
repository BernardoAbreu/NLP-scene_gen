<A>__{the heart of the millennium l.a. new year's ball. a glitterati event in full swing. red carpet, minicam lights and paparazzi. limos pulling up outside four deep. movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers and shakers chatting with city hall types. this is a party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here, there's no need to be anywhere else. there is a heavy police presence, as well as lots of private security. tran exits the elevator with vita minh, joey corto and duncan. they wedge through the crowd, tran smiling. nodding to people he knows.}
