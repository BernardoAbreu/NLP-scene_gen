<B>__{ali}
<A>__{hits foreman with a left. foreman launches a short left that ali counters with a big right cross that connects. foreman's head snaps around. sweat sprays in a parabola of light. crowd roars with expectation. george foreman tries a right uppercut, fails as ali circles, guiding foreman onto the ropes. foreman's on the ropes now. ali's eyes know the moment is...}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{now...}
<A>__{ali's short, chopping right turns foreman's head down. closer: foreman comes over the ropes and turns back into... ali's right hook slams his head down and sideways. and foreman charges into ali. close slo mo: ali snaps a combination: an overhead right to foreman's face, a short chopping left and a right hook. ali's eyes light up like white phosphorus.}
<C>__{ali }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{right now!}
<B>__{foreman}
<A>__{wrestles ali into the center. and the most significant moments begin... slo mo: ali on the left + foreman on the right ...and ali's left hand is extended way behind him with the wrist bent, no power. as it passes his body, ali converts it into a left hook. as he's doing this, he's dropping his left foot back. the left foot does not support a left hand. it's for a right hand so the body can untorque across with the punch. and ali is already cocking his right. meanwhile, the left connects with foreman's jaw and raises his chin. as the left is departing foreman's chin, ali launches the right. slo mo: as ali's right hand comes in, ali's torso untorques, transitioning all 217 pounds to ali's left foot and putting that weight and power behind his right fist that crashes into george foreman's chin...and the impact transfers to foreman's skull...and foreman's head snaps around. he is gone. he is falling in a spiral...a metaphor for vertigo...turning downward into unconsciousness. and through the spiral, ali has moved with him, pivoting with the falling foreman, his right fist cocked to unload again if he has to. he never does... massive overhead: foreman down. ali is pushed into the corner by referee zack clayton. foreman is counted out. clayton raises ali's hand. 65,000 people go crazy!}
<B>__{total chaos}
<A>__{ali is seized by rahaman, dundee, bundini. and in the corner, hardly seen by anybody, ali, now, faints. veronica, with a don king aide, is overcome. tears stream down her face.}
