<A>__{range and direction read out in rapid fire alpha numerics on the locator display. ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the swirling steam of the alien maze. she approaches an intersecting tunnel. flashing emergency lights illuminate the insane fresco of the walls. she spins, firing the flamethrower. nothing there. she whirls back. moves forward, trembling and adrenalized. skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre tormented positions like human insects in amber. steam blasts, blinding her. the locator signal strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low passage, turns again. at each intersection she quickly lights a fifteen minute marking flare and drops it. for the way back. she has to turn sideways, inching through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon niches, human bas relief sealed in resin. suddenly something shoots out, grabbing her! a hand. she recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in the wall. carter burke.}

<D>__{here.}
<A>__{she hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around the spoon, and pulls the primer. she moves on.}

<D>__{you now have eleven minutes to reach minimum safe distance.}
<A>__{ripley moves ahead. the locator signals shows she is almost there. a concussion rocks the place, like an earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet. then another. the whole station seems to shudder. a siren begins to wail a demented rhythm. following the tracker she turns a corner and stops. the range indicator reads zero. she looks down, horrified to see newt's tracer bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel. all hope recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.}
