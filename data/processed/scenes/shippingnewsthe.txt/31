<B>__{...bolt upright.}
<A>__{angle...front hallway, quoyle's bulk pounding toward us, boots in his hand. the front door ajar. and at the threshold, in a decorous semi circle, six naked barbies. legs spread wide for balance. each staring out the doorway, to where... ...bunny sits on the cold ground. making some craft project with great care. quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. ambles out, crouches beside her. close. she keeps working. almost eerie concentration. he sees now that she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum pop tops. he leans down. kisses her head.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{is that a belt or a crown?}
<A>__{no answer. that concerns him. the intensity of her focus. he notices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped. lined up in a row. he lifts one, liquid sloshes out. they're full.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{sodas get flat withou...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{this is important.}
<A>__{she won't look up. he glances back to the doorway.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that why the barbies are watching?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{they're being nice and patient.}

<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{they look better this way. they have great bodies.}
<A>__{he looks back. well. maybe so. holds up one of the heavy boots he's carrying. it has a thick blue shoelace. the other. has none. sticks that one in front of her face. she looks up to him. tugs on the shoelace, which she now wears as a necklace...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i need it. i look good in blue.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{well. i look good in shoes.}
<A>__{...sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt. the shoelace necklace holds a dull metal key as a pendant. he blinks.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i was lookin' for that all over our old place. the landlady s...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i need it.}
<A>__{he takes that in. the urgency of it. she is staring in his eyes. so he grins...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you had quite the heavy morning. take the rest of the day off.}
<A>__{she doesn't smile back. returns to her work. he looks out by the cliff, to see agnis staring across the bay, warren sitting at her side. he pulls on his boots. gets to his feet.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{be right back, and we'll start talking breakf...}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{watch out for the dog.}
<A>__{he looks across the ground toward old warren.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{yeh, her farts are pretty scary.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i mean. the white one!}
<A>__{now their eyes meet. matter of fact...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{the white dog with the big teeth and the red eyes. the skinny ghost owns him. they came last night.}
<A>__{he draws a breath...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i didn't dream 'em, don't say i did.}
<A>__{he thinks this over.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i was gonna say. i will keep my eyes peeled.}
<A>__{and makes a funny gesture, like peeling his eyeballs. she goes back to work. his eyes linger. then, he heads off toward the cliff. when he gets there...}

<D>__{i will get us a carpenter. fix the place up in no time. we'll find a rooming house til th...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{be cheaper to build a new one. on the riviera, even.}
<A>__{now she looks at him. her flat, bottomless eyes.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{only i weren't born. on the riviera.}
<A>__{o kay. that's settled. he nods, humbly, dumbly. she points off across the water. an actual town.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{flour sack cove. what time's your interview at that paper? ten o'clock?}
<A>__{ten o'clock.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{the drive's a bitch. we'll buy us a boat.}
<A>__{he tries a smile. unavoidably lame.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i'm not. a water person.}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{a boat. that's the ticket.}
<A>__{his grin hardens. just enough to say that on this issue, maybe even she can't push him. he turns around. starts back toward his daughter.}
