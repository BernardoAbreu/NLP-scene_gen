<L>__{interior theo's room day}
<A>__{mrs. dudley opens the door, letting theo and nell into a large bedroom, a mirror image twin of nell's room, except it's decorated in rich red orange velvets.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{this is so twisted.}
<A>__{she dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four poster bed, swings cat like onto its high mattress.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.}
<A>__{mrs. dudley lays theo's suitcase on a luggage stand.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{breakfast is at nine. i don't stay after dinner. not after it begins to get dark.}
<A>__{theo, back to mrs. dudley, rolls her eyes at nell.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley }
<D>__{i leave, before dark. so there won't be anyone around if you need help.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{we couldn't even hear you.}
<A>__{mrs. dudley looks up at nell who mimics her scary smile.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{no one could. no one lives any nearer than town.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no one will come any nearer than that.}
<A>__{mrs. dudley smiles at nell, but it's softer than before.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{in the night. in the dark.}
<A>__{theo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange. and then mrs. dudley backs out of the room, shuts the door.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{my room is right next door. i think we share a bathroom.}
<A>__{theo has an interesting eye on nell, she's studying her.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{don't worry, i probably won't be in here much. light sleeper.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{that's why we're here.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm between jobs right now. my last job... it... the person i was working for... the job ended. over. so... and you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{that depends.}
<A>__{theo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it. theo takes off her coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath. nell reacts, turns away. back to the camera, theo flicks off her bra, stretches.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{i'm supposed to be an artist, but i've been really distracted from work by love. do you know what i mean?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{don't tell me boston is different from new york.}
<C>__{nell}
<P>__{(she knows this from magazines)}
<D>__{ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{my boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. if we could all live together... but... they hate each other. it's hard to be miss perversity when you're the only one at the party. d'you know what i mean?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{a blank canvas! i could paint your portrait, directly on you. or maybe not. so, you? husbands? boyfriends? girlfriends? where do you live?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't have anyone.}
<P>__{(beat, lying)}
<D>__{but i do have a little apartment of my own. it has a little flower garden. you can just see the ocean. at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.}
<A>__{nell peeks, sees theo is decent, turns around.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{that sounds really nice. you're lucky. but you know that.}
<A>__{theo comes over, straightens nell's seams; this is an intimate, forward gesture.}
<C>__{theo }
<P>__{(with meaning)}
<D>__{come on, we've seen enough of the bedroom for now.}
