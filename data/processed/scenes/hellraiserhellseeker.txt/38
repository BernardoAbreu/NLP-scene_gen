<L>__{interior sage's office day}
<A>__{a chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall. trevor lies on the table. sage, a gorgeous ethereal indian woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet, sticking pins into the appropriate places. she looks up at him slyly.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{these headaches you've been getting. do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations?}
<A>__{sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more acupuncture needles. trevor can't help but notice her shapely body, her feline gait. sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her question.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(unsure of himself)}
<D>__{yes, sort of.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{my head's been in constant pain since the... accident. and the pain increases whenever i, uh... slip into another, i don't know what to call them...}
<A>__{sage comes back to him, several needles in one hand. she looks into his eyes.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{dreams?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i was going to say dimensions. but i guess technically they are dreams.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{you should always listen to your subconscious. it's trying to tell you something about your waking life.}
<A>__{sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{but i never feel like i'm sleeping. it's sort of, waking narcolepsy. i will be somewhere and then }
<P>__{(snapping his fingers)}
<D>__{ it's like i was never wherever i was to begin with i was really somewhere else entirely.}
<A>__{sage puts the last needle in. for the first time trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{ok, whatever that was...do it again. that just set me free of the worlds longest head ache. is this making any sense?}
<C>__{sage }
<D>__{none whatsoever. now just relax. let the needles do the driving.}
<A>__{a phone outside the office rings. sage looks up at the door.}
<C>__{sage }
<P>__{(patting his cheek)}
<D>__{don't go anywhere. i will be right back.}
<A>__{trevor watches sage exit the office. he lies there a moment, bathing in warm sunshine. he is relaxed, pain free. behind him, an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall. which begins to change its shape. it morphs (or economically changes) into pinhead. trevor is oblivious as pinhead approaches, doll eyes betraying no feeling whatsoever. then, pinhead reaches up to his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins. it takes a while to come out. because it is a foot long. once out, the needle drips with black ooze. trevor hears a noise and believes its sage who's reentered the room.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm thinking this might just be what i needed.}
<A>__{pinhead speaks but in sages voice. as he pushes on of the pins into the tip trevors skin in his back .}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no matter what happens just remember...}
<A>__{before trevor can react, pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down into trevor's back, pinning him to the table! it sears his skin. in pinheads recognizable voice...}
<C>__{pinhead }
<D>__{we're all here for you trevor.}
<A>__{as trevor reels in terror, pinhead pulls another foot long needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck! we see the needle come right out the other side, nailing itself into the table. trevor can't believe he's still alive! pinhead pulls one more out, aims this one at trevor's arm, and swings down.}
