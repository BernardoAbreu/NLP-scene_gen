<L>__{exterior cabin}
<A>__{it is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white. a brown ciera with dealer plates is pulling into the drive. grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as carl climbs out of the driver's. grimsrud opens the back door and, with an arm on her elbow, helps jean out. she has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head. with a cry, she swings her elbow out of grimsrud's grasp and lurches away across the front lawn. grimsrud moves to retrieve her but carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{they both look out at the front lawn, grimsrud expressionless, carl smiling. with muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on the uneven terrain. she stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying. she lurches out in an arbitrary direction. going downhill, she reels, staggers, and falls face first into the snow, weeping.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{ha ha ha ha ha ha! jesus!}
<A>__{grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from carl's restraining hand to retrieve her.}
