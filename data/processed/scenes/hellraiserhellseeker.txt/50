<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{ he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. the various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are beeping and pinging like slot machines. allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{sorry about that. there was a blockage in your oxygen hose. won't happen again, promise.}
<A>__{trevor looks relieved. shell shocked but relieved.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm certainly keeping you busy huh?}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{too bad i hate my job...}
<A>__{she strokes his forehead.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{feeling better now?}
<A>__{trevor shakes his head.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{these hallucinations i'm having. i think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{if they're blocked memories... i'm starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out. allison i think i really... screwed everything up.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{shh. don't blame yourself trevor. please.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i miss her. i miss my wife.}
<A>__{trevor takes her hand. allison looks briefly around her then... climbs onto the bed with him.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{if you need to cry, go ahead. i won't tell.}
<A>__{holding her hand to his face, trevor closes his eyes, squeezing out a tear. close on trevor's face. we start to notice subtle differences about allison's hand. it is very pale, the fingernails black. trevor opens his eyes.}
