<A>__{banky, holden, alyssa and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table. alyssa and the girl continue to make out. holden and banky casually watch, wide eyed. banky stares a little harder. holden hits him.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{that's rude.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{man, when are we ever going to get a chance to see this kind of shit live without paying for it?}
<A>__{alyssa and the girl break their kiss.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{uh oh better knock it off: we're getting a man excited.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sorry. it's just... new to him.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{oh, and you're an old hand at this.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, i should apologize. i don't usually get all mushy in public. but it's been awhile since i've seen kim here.}
<C>__{kim}
<P>__{(formerly the girl)}
<D>__{tell me you didn't set that gross display up with the band just so you could nail me.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{like i'd have to go through that much effort}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{you know what! i want to dance.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{go ahead. i will watch from here.}
<C>__{kim}
<P>__{(tugging at her arm)}
<D>__{no. i want to dance with you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{don't be such a rag. i have to sit here and work up the desire to fuck you later.}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{kim exits. banky is smiling ear to ear. alyssa looks at him.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you said 'fuck'. to that girl. you said you'd 'fuck' her.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{how can a girl 'fuck' another girl! were you talking about strap ons or something?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(hits him)}
<D>__{would you shut up!!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what!!? it's a valid question. you know the dyke stuff in the penthouse letters section is written by guys this is our chance to get the inside scoop.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(to alyssa)}
<D>__{i don't know how many times i can apologize for him.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it's okay. secretly, all i really want is to be the center of attention.}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{i've never used a snap on.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{then what's with saying 'fuck? shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at least modify the term 'fuck' with something like 'fist'?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{let me ask you a question can men 'fuck' each other!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{ask hooper.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{in your estimation.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so for you, to 'fuck' means to penetrate. you're used to the more traditional definition you inside some girl you've duped, jack hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{hey i always notice the bored look in their eyes.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{'fucking' is nor limited to penetration, banky. for me it describes any sex when it's not totally about love. i don't love kim, but i will fuck her. i'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{some of them i downright loathe.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but i will bet it's different with the ones you love. i will bet you go the full nine when it's not just a quick fix like you go down on them longer or something.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i don't do that.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{what?!?!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i stopped dropping. it got to be too frustrating.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{as stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of your's, you're going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what?! i lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out. what's the big deal?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{if you say the smell, so help me, i will slug you.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{not the smell the smell is good. i'm talking about not being able to do it property. and my mother brought me up to believe that if i can't do something right i shouldn't do it at all. of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the pointerior}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{at least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{no, i blame them. chicks never help you out. they never tell you what to do. and most of them are self conscious about that smell factor, and so most of the time they just lay there, frozen like a deer in the headlights, right? not for nothing, but when a chick goes down on me. i let her know where to go, and what the status is. you gotta handle it like cnn and the weather channel constant updates.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're such an idiot.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, he's got a pointerior that's how i was in high school i was nervous, and inhibited about being eaten out. but by the time i got to college, that all changed. i loosened up. not only did i learn to communicate i learned to be bossy. i was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights waving them this way, directing them that way, telling them when to stop.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{and that's all i'm saying, it'd be different if chicks helped out pointed a guy in the right direction. then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted time, and no chance for permanent injuries.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{permanent injuries?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{sure. you wanna see something permanent!}
<P>__{(pulls our front tooth)}
<D>__{i got this from nina rollins, sophomore year. i'm going down on her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her stomach. she does this big ol' pelvic thrust cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat. i had to get a crown for the stub.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{i got that beat.}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{i got that beat.}
<P>__{(half turns and lifts chin)}
<D>__{sophomore year. i'm going down on cynthia slater in her dorm room after we went club hopping. i'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it, i fall asleep right there in her lap. she got so mad, she digs her heel into my back, right there.}
<P>__{(points to scar)}
<D>__{that's permanent.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you see this!}
<P>__{(moves neck slightly right)}
<D>__{that's the farthest i can move my neck to the right sophomore year, i'm going out with maria bennert, and for six months, i'm going down on her, and not a damn thing's happening. then one night, i change a position, or vary my lapping speed, and suddenly it's a whole new world. she's moving around, convulsing, breathing heavy. and her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that i don't hear her father come into the room. he grabs my hair...}
<P>__{(grabs his own hair and pulls back)}
<D>__{...and he pulls me way back, hard.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(throws up her leg, and rolls up pants)}
<D>__{senior year. spring formal. i'm eating our missy kurt in her brother's car. she's laying across the back seat, and i'm half hanging out of the car, my knees on the ground. she's flailing around, and she knocks the parking brake off. the car starts rolling down the hill, and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy's scissor class cut it up for paper dolls.}
<A>__{banky and alyssa laugh. holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it. then kim re enters and plants a big kiss on alyssa's neck.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off banky's watch)}
<D>__{holy shit, is that the time. we've gotta beat traffic.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what traffic it's one thirty in the morning!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{and rush hour starts in six hours. let's go.}
<P>__{(to alyssa)}
<D>__{thanks for inviting us out. it was... educational.}
<A>__{alyssa waves at him as he exits. banky slides out of the booth.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to kim)}
<D>__{since you like chicks, right.. do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time?}
<A>__{holden reaches in and pulls banky out. alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses kim.}
