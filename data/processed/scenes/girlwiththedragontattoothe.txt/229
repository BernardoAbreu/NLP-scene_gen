<A>__{trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, blomkvist walks past martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness. he tries the door. locked. comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house. he peers through a floor to ceiling window, but can't see much inside. comes around to the back and looks in another window. tries the back door. unlocked.}
