<A>__{charlie is on the speakerphone. the angels are in their usual lounging positions.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{good work, angels. not only did you save knox, you saved his company as well.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{i think that earns us a vacation.}

<D>__{say, fiji?}

<P>__{(to natalie)}
<D>__{any special guy you were thinking of inviting?}
<A>__{natalie grins a guilty smile.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{sorry, angels. our work is only half done.}
<A>__{knox enters. clean shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a darn good looking man. vivian wu follows him.}
<C>__{charlie's voice }
<D>__{meet your new client, eric knox.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{first off, thank you. you rescued me, for which i am eternally grateful.}
<A>__{he's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall most upon dylan. she notices it.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{but there's still a problem. whoever kidnapped me wasn't just trying to screw up our ipo. they also stole the proprietary software for our new web browser. i'm sure it was roger corwin, but i need proof.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{that's where you come in, angels.}
<A>__{circling around, we see the video images of corwin and the red star systems logo on the big screen.}
<C>__{charlie's voice }
<D>__{we need to break into red star's computer systems to see if mr. knox's software is indeed being converted for red star's use.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{sounds like a plan.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{not as easy as that, natalie. red star's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility. we're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system, and the best way to get that is through mr. corwin himself.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 a video image of corwin's palm pilot schedule comes up the bigscreen. the shot pulls in close on "san diego speedway."}
<C>__{charlie's voice }
<D>__{we need to pin a camera on him to get footage of the inside of the building. thanks to alex's work at the health spa, we know that corwin will be at the san diego speedway on thursday. get close to him angels, but don't tip your hand.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{consider it done.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{dylan, i need you to arrange for mr. knox's security. i'd hate to have him kidnapped again.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{absolutely. but we'd all feel safer if you could join us, charlie.}
