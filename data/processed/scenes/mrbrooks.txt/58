<L>__{interior indoor pool n night}
<A>__{the lane lines are in place. detective atwood is the only one in the water. up and down she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns. she's not swimming for pleasure, she's working out. the underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and ceiling and since they are the only illumination, the room feels spooky. atwood's fingers touch the wall. she raises her head to check her time, then takes off her goggles. hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath, lowers herself under the surface, blows a lungful of bubbles, comes up to face larry, a man slightly younger than she is, in a beautiful suit, perched on the edge of the deck looking down at her. he has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand.}
