<A>__{east l.a. sidestreet night two ten year old black boys are walking down the street. out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers. quite suddenly, without warning a football drops out of the sky. hits and bounces, very high comes down. settles. rocks, back and forth. the kids look up, puzzled. searching the sky. the ball sits there. only slightly scorched. tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught, one of the boys bends down... looks both ways... picks up the ball. smiles. then, as if by some unspoken agreement the other boy starts to run. slowly at first, then faster... faster still... a slant pattern, heading for the mailbox... and at 12 midnight on december 22nd, the san pedro street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass. their laughter is joyful. innocent. fervid. they will grow up to be sports heroes.}
