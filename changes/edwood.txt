Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero. Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within. The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN "BUNNY" BRECKINRIDGE, 45, hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls.}

He takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth! The cast is flabbergasted.}
