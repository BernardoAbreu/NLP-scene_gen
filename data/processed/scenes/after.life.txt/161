<L>__{exterior cemetery late afternoon}
<A>__{the sun's low on the horizon. eliot whistles softly to himself as he digs a grave. working meticulously. like everything else he does. suddenly a shadow falls over eliot. he calmly looks up. the sun's behind the figure. for a moment eliot can't tell who it is.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you said you could teach me.}
<A>__{eliot smiles. gestures to jack to come inside the grave. jack steps back. the grave terrifies him.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{it's only a hole in the ground. i'm digging it for }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miss bryant.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{exactly. for anna. she belongs here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because she's dead.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. because there's no life left in her.}
<A>__{jack carefully considers eliot's words.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{don't you see? i have no choice. i'm the only one who can see all these corpses. wandering the earth aimlessly. all they do is piss and shit. suffocating us with their stench. doing nothing with their lives. taking the air away from those who actually want to live. i have to bury them all. i have no choice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now there's two of us.}
<A>__{eliot holds up the shovel. jack looks at him for a moment then reaches for the shovel.}
