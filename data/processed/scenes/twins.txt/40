<D>__{it's him. he's back.}
<A>__{a pretty young cocktail waitress called marnie turns and stares daggers at vince. marnie is a fireball of a girl, all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton candy on the inside, sort of a jean harlow valley girl. she approaches vince, who greets her with effusive warmth.}

<D>__{marnie! how are you? is your sister around?}
<A>__{marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous occupants of the booth. marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into his lap.}

<A>__{marnie's sister, linda, also a cocktail waitress, slips into the booth and gives vince a big kiss. linda, although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a completely different personality: she's trusting, dependent, and legally blind when it comes to vincent.}
