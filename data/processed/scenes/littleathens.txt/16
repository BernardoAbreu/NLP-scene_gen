<A>__{jessica walks over to the answering machine and hits a button. the answering machine clicks on as jessica brushes unenthusiastically.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<P>__{(electronic voice)}
<D>__{you have one new message.}
<P>__{(jina's voice)}
<D>__{hi jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when i get home. i'm driving your sister to school and i'm leaving the car for her, so i will be taking the train back.}
<A>__{jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. she spins around to an open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste to the concrete sidewalk below. her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the answering machine.}
<C>__{answering machine }
<D>__{by the way, you should call your sister and stop this not talking nonsense.}
<A>__{jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the answering machine.}
<C>__{answering machine }
<D>__{anyway, i know how you hate long messages, so i will see you tomorrow...}
<A>__{suddenly wide awake, jessica turns to her mother.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{that's fucking bullshit.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{here we go again.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what about my car?!}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. now i've got about two hours sleep before i have to drive her all the way the hell up there.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{yeah, i heard that.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jess, you're still living here for free.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{on the couch!}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it. can't you be happy for your sister?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{oh yeah, i'm real happy. she gets my car, and i get shit. thanks, jina. do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy i am for her.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{if you're going to be like this, i'm just going to bed.}
<A>__{jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water. jessica returns to the living room wearing a t shirt that reads "athens youth group" in large letters along the front. jina is gone. jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly. she grabs a pair of large sunglasses off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes. she opens the door and exits the apartment.}
