<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{bobby enters the room, right behind pavel. he sees: a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them. there is a television on in the corner, a russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding. there are other people in the room: a brown haired man; and two dark haired slavic looking women. it's an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics. the slavic man takes out the stacks of bills. starts counting them methodically. pavel motions to the brown haired man, puts up two fingers. on cue, the brown haired man rubs his hands together, then takes two large jars from his desk. beneath the desk, bobby spots what looks like an enormous number of packages of narcotics, stacked against the wall. this is clearly their stash house. the brown haired man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter. he sits down, takes off his jacket, revealing: tattoos, up and down both of his arms. the designs combine several images skulls, snakes, and the spider web element that marked vadim's own tattoo. he takes a rusty letter opener it had been sitting atop the desk and pierces a green package. white powder seeps from the package. bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. he uses two playing cards to move the drug. bobby eyes that rusty}
<B>__{letter opener...}
<A>__{the brown haired man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix. he is cutting the drug. he continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show. close shot on some lines of cocaine. pavel takes a toot. he offers it to bobby as a taste. bobby accepts. he pulls down his mask momentarily, rubbing a rather large quantity of the drug on his gums, his lip. we hear:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski's voice}
<D>__{you needed to come here tonight...?}
<A>__{bobby looks over to see: emerging from the black, from down a darkened hallway: vadim nezhinski. everyone is wearing a surgical mask except, of course, for him. bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more bloodshot by the second.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{what's the matter, ain't pavel good enough for you?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{that's all the money i got. and i ain't gonna leave it alone.}
<A>__{the slavic youth finishes counting bobby's cash:}
<C>__{slavic youth}
<D>__{it's all there. fifty grand.}
<A>__{vadim points to the money:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{from my savings. from el caribe and rasputin.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<P>__{(nods; then:)}
<D>__{that buys you three keys in here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{with the crack on the street, it's worth two hundred k. maybe more.}
<A>__{vadim walks over to a stack of green packages:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski }
<D>__{all the shit i get here is at least eighty six percent pure. and we got a lot more comin' in a lot more. in a way nobody could ever trace.}
<A>__{vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards bobby:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski }
<D>__{the whole city'll be sucking our glass soon you'll see. we push the guineas out, the domos'll work for us.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<A>__{vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward. bobby's forehead has beads of sweat. vadim walks up close. looks bobby in the eye for a beat.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{you're breathing heavy.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i took a little taste.}
<A>__{vadim puts his hand on bobby's chest, checking his heartbeat.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{you know, i seen fighters they breathe like that, means they get nervous.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you nervous?}
<A>__{bobby shakes his head. he is wired, out of it, but he pulls himself together. his jaw clenches. with fire, an edge of defiance:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i'm clean.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{you wanna search me again, you go `head. i just wanna make this deal and go home.}
<A>__{vadim violently pulls out bobby's pockets. out falls: a wallet, some change, keys, a cigarette lighter, matches. he sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. it fires. bobby gets slightly edgy. notices that the others congregate around the objects from his pocket all except for pavel, who holds an ak 47 trained on bobby. bobby inches ever closer to the rusted letter opener that the brown haired man had used to open a package of cocaine. vadim puts down the lighter. and it occurs to him:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{you got both matches and a lighter.}
<A>__{bobby realizes instantly that vadim is right. bobby shrugs, feigning innocence. he braces himself and decides to give the signal:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i'm gonna get pussy from this...}
<C>__{pavel lubyarsky}
<P>__{(befuddled)}
<D>__{what you say...?}
<A>__{bobby looks around. there's no cavalry to the rescue. he tries again:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{[when] this deal goes down, i'm, i'm gonna get a lotta pussy...}
<A>__{still nothing. pavel's attention turns to vadim. he moves toward nezhinski, who: starts frantically pounding the lighter against the desk. trying break it open. bobby scans the jointerior.. the men are trained on that lighter, and this is his chance. he slips the letter opener into his hand.}
<B>__{seems like we can literally hear the blood rushing through}
<A>__{bobby's head now. setting himself, bobby looks around the room where's that backup??? and: the camera speeds past pavel's and vadim's faces, to the other side of the room. it moves toward the window: vadim hits the lighter again. this time, it breaks open. revealing a bevy of wires. it is clearly not just a lighter. the camera tilts up. vadim is enraged:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{he got a wire!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{kill this motherfucker, right now!}
<A>__{it looks like he's a goner. pavel raises his gun and charges toward bobby about to fire, when the door bursts open. cops everywhere. mike and jack lead the way, but there are what seems like tens of emergency services unit officers with them:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{hands on your heads! on the floor!}
<B>__{no one freezes. chaos. gunfire. pavel swings back to}
<A>__{bobby, a terrifying look on his face. but bobby is ready, and shoves the letter opener into pavel's neck. blood cascades down the man's chest. pavel collapses on bobby, still very much alive. his eyes are popping, and he throws his hands around bobby's throat. vadim charges into:}
