<L>__{interior capt. spaulding's night}
<A>__{suddenly... crash! ravelli smashes through the front door knocking karl to the ground. in the light we see that ravelli is wearing an oversized clown head. in his hand is a sledgehammer. rich turns toward the commotion. the captain quickly whips out a gun and fires. rich falls dead. ravelli lunges at karl, smashing him over the head with the hammer. ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the floor. we now see that ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red. karl hits the floor and begins convulsing violently. spaulding steps down from behind the counter, puts his foot on karl's throat and points his pistol at karl's head.}
<C>__{capt. spaulding}
<D>__{and most of all... fuck you!}

<C>__{denise}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah, in this book there's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm less wonder.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it says, "records show that ellie thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility."}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(scanning the book)}
<D>__{blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as ellie bogdan, the arm less wonder. says she, "criss crossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr. satan working at the looney bin. i will bet he amputated her arms.}
