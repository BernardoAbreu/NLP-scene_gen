<A>__{exhilarated, lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. he's happier than he's been in years.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{yeah!}
<L>__{interior restaurant later that day}
<A>__{carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. there are two menus on the table. after a moment, buddy kane, the real estate king, joins her. carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{carolyn.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{buddy.}
<A>__{carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i'm so sorry i kept you waiting. christy left for new york this morning, and... let's just say things were very hectic around the house.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{what's she doing in new york?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{she's moving there.}
<P>__{(off carolyn's look)}
<D>__{yes. we are splitting up.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{buddy. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{yes, according to her, i'm too focused on my career. as if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. oh. wow.}
<P>__{(then, laughing)}
<D>__{ah, it's for the best.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{when i saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times.}
<A>__{he smiles, then opens his menu. carolyn picks hers up mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent christian who's just come face to face with jesus.}
