<LOC>__{EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.}

<ACTION>__{A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.}

<ACTION>__{Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a billboard announcing a 'new' housing development.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.}
<LOC>__{INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.}

<DIAL>__{I told you.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The men get out of the car.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(loud whisper)}
<DIAL>__{There!! Up on the hill!!}

<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?}
<ACTION>__{The officer strains to see through the fog.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Benny, there's nothing there.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...}
<ACTION>__{The second officer is peering intently at something down among the houses.}

<CHAR>__{MIKE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(SECOND OFFICER)}
<DIAL>__{What's that?}
<ACTION>__{Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among the houses below them. Further into the track another beam of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise stationary.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What did I tell you?}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Probably kids.}
<ACTION>__{One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other side.}
<CHAR>__{MIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(not convinced)}
<DIAL>__{Probably...}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police car which is idling along the dirt road with its running lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a red tint.}
<LOC>__{INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't you think you should call a backup?}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, we can handle this.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the houses.}
<LOC>__{INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises a hand to eye level. There is a sharp "SNAP" and a hard-edged cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the silhouette.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight swings onto the house.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(over outside speakers)}
<DIAL>__{This is the police. Identify yourselves.}
<ACTION>__{It is deathly silent. Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light. The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in and out of visual contact with each other. Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light pointing at a cement mixer.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the officers, his voice cracking)}
<DIAL>__{There's one over here...}
<ACTION>__{The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands trembling, raises the gun.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stop!! Police!!}
<ACTION>__{The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple shots. The light goes out immediately.}
<CHAR>__{MIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(in Benny's direction)}
<DIAL>__{What happened?}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think I shot one.}
<CHAR>__{MIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?}
<LOC>__{INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog outlines him.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The men strain to see something through the silent fog.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You see anything, Mike?}
<ACTION>__{Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is the police. Identify yourselves.}
<ACTION>__{Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shouts to the officers)}
<DIAL>__{You wanna give me some help over here.}
<CHAR>__{MIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay...}
<ACTION>__{Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands. At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the houses. The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth.}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mike, call for back-up.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shouting)}
<DIAL>__{Benny, you all right?}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think so...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(clutching his shoulder)}
<CHAR>__{OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(waving the beam of his flashlight, shouts)}
<DIAL>__{Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.}
<ACTION>__{Benny's beam flashes back.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't leave me. I'm coming.}
<ACTION>__{The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.}
<LOC>__{INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive language. Through the window over the sink we can see the lights of the spaceship. The rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is airborne out the open back door.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening as it begins to rise above the trees. With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and disappears into the fog. With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock Benny and the officers off their feet.}
<LOC>__{EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate.}

<DIAL>__{Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix position for rescue. Repeat. Fix position for rescue.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in the open squad car.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us.}
<LOC>__{INT. TRUCK - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets one and reaches for the lighter.}

<ACTION>__{The escaped figure banks around a blind corner.}
<LOC>__{INT. TRUCK - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of its boots scars the windshield.}
<LOC>__{EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go out.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the high beams, are peering into the woods.}

<DIAL>__{Damned if I know.}
<LOC>__{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint identification light that flickers on and off inside its helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and threatens to suffocate him. Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that delineate his mouth are chalk-white. He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.}

<CHAR>__{PARTNER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{How about if I drive now?}
<ACTION>__{Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.}
<LOC>__{INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK}
<ACTION>__{A light rain is falling. We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK}
<ACTION>__{A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear inside. Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to greet him.}

<ACTION>__{Hooded, Bell and Shermin make their way past three suited scientists examining the landscape with geiger counters and other sensing instruments. With the coming of dawn and Bell's handlight we can clearly see the pod indentations and the huge black glass cup of earth that was fused by the energy blasting out of the spaceship's power plant.}
<CHAR>__{MAJOR BELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.}

<DIAL>__{People have made mistakes in these situations before.}
<CHAR>__{MAJOR BELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK}
<ACTION>__{It is still raining. The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start. He parts the tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his knees and stands up.}
<LOC>__{INT. BIOQUARANTINE TENT (HOUSING TRACT) - DAWNBREAK}
<ACTION>__{The sound of a powerful slow-speed drill greets Bell and Shermin as they enter. The extraterrestrial is still on its back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction- sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. Both are wearing contamination suits. A foam-lined coffin-shaped metal box is on the ground next to one of the walls. Bell and Shermin approach the body. Shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see is his own reflection. His eyes travel down the body.}
<CHAR>__{MAJOR BELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at the hands.}
<ACTION>__{The gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a thumb. Shermin takes Bell's flashlight. He angles it at the faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect on the glass of their contamination hoods. (Pause)}

<DIAL>__{We better get it into the box. Come on...}
<ACTION>__{The other men approach the body but before they can bend to it a burst of percussive language, followed by a low buzz, comes from inside the extraterrestrial's helmet. The men freeze. There is another burst of percussive language and a projection beam shoots out of the helmet throwing the image of the escaped STAR MAN onto one of the scientists. He jumps aside and the beam falls out of focus and indistinct on the tent wall behind him.}

<ACTION>__{The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that disappears when his palms come together.}

<ACTION>__{The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him. When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on. Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a Mustang Hatchback.

The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.

He notices the shirt is askew across his chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but are noticeably more precise. The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to see if it is on securely. He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is now.
