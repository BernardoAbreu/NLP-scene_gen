<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{are you really in our grade?}
<A>__{william turns to see tall, adenoidal tim tobin. the most mature looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges william in a loud theatrical tone. it is a voice right out of guys and dolls, which incidentally is the school play in which tobin had just starred. william answers in a respectful voice. he is desperate for acceptance.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tobin}
<D>__{hey guys! check it out! william doesn't have any pubes !}
<A>__{others now begin to gather around, examining william. he has never been more naked.}
<D>__{guy # 1 how old are you man?}
<C>__{tobin}
<D>__{he's not a man, he's a little baby kid. he doesn't even get zits yet. guy # 2 how come you don't have any hair down there?}
<C>__{tobin}
<P>__{(in loud, funny voice) where are your pubes???!!}
<A>__{their voices echo off the tiled walls. now everyone is watching the hairless william. he is confused by their meanness.}
<D>__{guy # 2 yeah. where are your pubes?}
<A>__{all eyes are on him, waiting for a response. the kid's mental wheels turn frantically. and from somewhere comes an attitude, a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could only be a merciful deity.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(cool, dismissive)}
<D>__{i had 'em. i shaved 'em off.}
<A>__{it is a new persona for the kid the witty guy. and it works. guy #2 cracks up, then others. william's new accuser is suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these older boys. others turn away, on to other things. tobin stares at william, and then also turns away.}
