<A>__{some days later. queen victoria sits at her desk while henry ponsonby stands in front of her, holding a copy of the times.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{read it.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{again?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{read it!}
<A>__{ponsonby coughs once and begins again.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{"the times wishes to join the rest of her majesty's loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the queen is soon to come out of her mourning."}
<A>__{victoria glowers at him.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{who told them that?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{i forgive me, ma'am, i am no wiser than yourself.}
<A>__{suddenly, victoria's temper goes and she shouts at him.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{no one should think themselves wiser than me!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it is not for any of the queen's subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning. it is the queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely!}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{your majesty }
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(cutting right through him)}
<D>__{is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!}

<D>__{i am not a fool.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. sometimes i feel that brown is all i have left of albert.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and now they attack brown too.}
<A>__{she looks up, eyes blazing.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{i will not give him up to them.}
