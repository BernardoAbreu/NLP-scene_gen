<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{see what? i don't have glasses, you moron.}
<A>__{rafkin backs down the hall, maggie behind him. he catches a quick glimpse of the first figure again. this time it's closer. he re checks the other corridor, and the suicide is there.}

<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{if it's down here it's not a good thing, trust me.}
<A>__{rafkin spins around, and the '50s kid is on top of him. he swings his bat madly at rafkin, connecting on the last swing. rafkin, in an explosion of sparks, goes sailing. maggie quickly scoops rafkin up and starts hauling him down the corridor with the suicide in pursuit.}
