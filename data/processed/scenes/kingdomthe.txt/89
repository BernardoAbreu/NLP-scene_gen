<A>__{the sang officer in charge steps to al ghazi. in arabic:}
<C>__{sang officer}
<D>__{this is unacceptable. colonel al ghazi it's cleared with general abdul malik. we have five minutes here.}
<C>__{special forces officer}
<D>__{we were told they must remain in the vehicles... colonel al ghazi that is not true...}
<C>__{special forces officer}
<D>__{they must stay in the toyotas colonel al ghazi report me then when you get in touch with the general }
<A>__{ officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers al ghazi open handed as al ghazi tries to step past. collective shock. in that breath, haytham punishes the officer with a left cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him. haytham's kick follows, catches the officer in the sternum as he hits ground. al ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the sang second in command. leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two steps. fleury aims, drills the soldier that butted leavitt: instant night night. another sang steps up. fleury throats him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits the ground. fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four seconds. then, a `knock it off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one foot from janet's head. we hear what she hears: one half second of the shot, then the big ring. on her knees immediately, hand over her ear. in response: heavy caliber gunfire flies: group flinch n crouch. the warning shots from a .50 caliber mounted on a humvee racing this way from al rahmah: dust plumes from the speed. members of the security detail and the special forces go mexican stand off.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{tell me it didn't burst tell me it didn't burst }
<A>__{al ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away from the ear. a sang nearby sees this: spits two inches from al ghazi. al ghazi leans to janet's non ringing side:}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi no blood.}
<A>__{the humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas. general abdul malik out of the passenger seat, in arabic:}
<D>__{general abdul malik who fired?}
<A>__{that soldier's hand goes up sheepish. two men out of the humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt: cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.}
<P>__{general abdul malik (cont'd)}
<D>__{and why?}
<C>__{special forces officer}
<P>__{(standing, doubled over)}
<D>__{a disagreement.}
<A>__{the general grabs the officer by the back of his head: an abusive dad. walks him to the side.}
<D>__{general abdul malik}
<P>__{(back to al ghazi)}
<D>__{five minutes.}
<A>__{al ghazi looks back down at janet, at leavitt's bruise, at the man fleury knocked out. angry. impressed: fought alongside him. haytham hasn't moved an inch, not even when the general came, chin raised to an entire platoon: say when.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(to fleury)}
<D>__{five minutes.}
<A>__{the sang move back. the team staggered, slowly remembering why they're here in the first place, finally make their way to the roof top.}
