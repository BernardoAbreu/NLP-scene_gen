<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{catch leaving sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions, staring hard at his thoughts and he steps into the path of a car. the car screeches to a stop, and the scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps paralyze catch, and he sees flashback sliver of image headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving. back to scene (present) this sliver of memory jolts him and then another one comes. flashback headlights coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory, and all of this is exploded back to scene (present) by the angry driver shouting at him.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing?!}
<A>__{catch is numb completely shut down there in the middle of the street. the driver exits his car and comes toward him, raging.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{are you crazy?!}
<A>__{catch isn't even aware of him. the man gawks at this and now catch walks off. it is raining. the streets are wet. angle residential street night as catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken but when he passes a parked car with the window half open, rain getting in, he hesitates. he can't just walk on. he looks about. he tests the lock. he opens the door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on. but a man is just exiting a doorway to the street and calls out...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey! hey! what did you do?}
<A>__{catch stops and turns in the rain. the man hurries toward him, upset, angry.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that's my car! what the hell were you doing?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{nothing. i just...}
<A>__{the man shoves him.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i saw you! what did you take out of there?!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no, i rolled up the window. it's rain...}
<A>__{the man gets in his face, shaky...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you take my phone?! hah?!}
<A>__{he shoves catch again, and catch's desperate confusion explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the man's jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly slap, slap, slapping him, saying...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{hey! hey! wake up! wake up!}
<A>__{the man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as catch's eyes hold him with a fierceness and a sadness.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i helped you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i helped you.}
<A>__{catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away, hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled. he gets five steps away and turns. the man steps back but catch only says...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{and he walks on. the man watches him go.}
