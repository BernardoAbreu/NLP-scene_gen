<A>__{the airborne humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces. troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked humvee. silence. a wheel on the wrecked humvee spin in the air, squeaking. louis vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. one has opened and the gold bars are spilled around. shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some limping. they cover their faces with their clothes as the dense brown fog descends around them.}
