<C>__{sue }
<D>__{oh. well then...}
<A>__{the undies drop. the cops stare open mouthed. they turn to look at reed, astonished. he sheepishly shrugs his shoulders.}

<D>__{i'm gonna need serious therapy.}
<A>__{a beat. she walks away. the cops watch her, gaping. by the time they turn back around, reed and johnny are gone, disappearing into the clouds of smoke.}
