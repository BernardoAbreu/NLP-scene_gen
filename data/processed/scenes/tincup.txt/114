<L>__{exterior pine hills clubhouse early morning}
<A>__{two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee. our intrepid don quixote and sancho panza.}
<L>__{exterior golf course early morning}
<A>__{the first tee the early morning air is heavy and still. the course is quiet and wet with dew. the gallery is sparse. the silence is broken by the starter's voice.}
<C>__{starter }
<D>__{with the honor in the 7:08 pairing, from salome, texas, mr. roy mcavoy.}
<A>__{a half dozen people clap, and tin cup and romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on time. tin cup is massively hung over and unshaven.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{no time for a bucket, eh?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{almost missed the starting time trying to get you off the floor, boss. you don't handle the hooch like you used to...}
<A>__{tin cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried practice swings. the early tee times are strictly for the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around. tin cup's hand shakes as he closes the velcro flap on his glove. he's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew on patches, as he stares down the first fairway. romeo hands him a driver.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i seen this hole on tv. hit the big dog down the chute }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{no, i've learned my lesson. gonna play it safe, smart, conservative. fairways and greens. hand me the two iron.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{thought of the day is `be humble.'}
<A>__{and tin cup launches a two iron down the first fairway.}
