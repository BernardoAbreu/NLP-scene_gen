<L>__{interior camp night}
<A>__{they are safe and snug in their hideaway. hector has lit his candle. he is reading his letters, holding them close to his eyes in the dimness. he has the air of someone putting his affairs in order. bobby is thinking aloud.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{maybe he's lost too... on his own... must be delaware... they were chased up here years ago... everybody thought they'd cleared off west... the other side of ohio... they were an angry lot... no wonder... they used to farm on the coast.}
<A>__{he looks up at hector, and allows himself a small smile.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{go on, read it out...}
<A>__{hector looks up.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what? no... not tonight...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i've had to listen to it every night since april... why not now?}
<A>__{hector gives in. he holds a scrap of paper close to the candle and reads.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{dear, father, i miss you. three frogs are dead. everybody misses you. bring me a bear's head and claws and a gun. school is good. miss white has married a fireman. come back soon. do not worry about the frogs, they did not have names. nathaniel.}
<A>__{hector looks up at bobby.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's not so funny now as it was.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it wasn't funny then.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{if you knew him... if you could picture him saying it... it would be funnier.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i had a father like you... nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm going home, for the winter...}
<A>__{bobby doesn't pursue his argument. he tenses, then sniffs the air vigorously.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{smell it?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{goddam it... smell it?}
<A>__{hector sniffs some more.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{tobacco?}
<A>__{they whisper.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{where the hell is it coming from?}
<A>__{he puts his head out of the shelter.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't tell... a night like this it could carry for miles...}
<A>__{he huddles back inside the shelter.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i wish i had a smoke.}
<A>__{after a tense silence, hector takes a small package from an inside pocket. he hands it to bobby.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i was saving it... you have it...}
<A>__{it is a wedge of tobacco. bobby takes it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what do you mean, you were saving it? you know the rules... no hoarding, tobacco or food... you've listened to me for a month, day and night... wanting a smoke...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well have it now... i don't smoke... take it...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you've kept it from me, and you don't even use it...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i was saving it for my birthday... i was going to give it to you then...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i have to wait until your birthday for a smoke? who are you... the fucking king?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{go on, smoke it... have it now...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i bloody won't... i'm not smoking on your command... i bloody won't.}
<A>__{there is a brooding silence.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{god, your poor children... what do they have to do for a piece of candy in your house? it's very hard to like you sometimes... d'you know that?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i know, bobby... but that's how i feel about you, too... that's why we're friends... we try hard... come on... smoke your pipe...}
<A>__{hector is neatly turning the tables on bobby, who now appears churlish, childish.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no... i will have it in the morning.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{come on... tell me... who would you rather be sitting here with... have a think...}
<A>__{bobby does, and then breaks into a smile.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{daniel boone?}
<A>__{hector smiles, too.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yeah. he would be a help... but after daniel boone...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't think of anyone else... but you're impossible to like sometimes.}
<A>__{suddenly bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we should sleep. we've got a lot of running to do in the morning.}
<A>__{but hector has other plans. he is in control of their friendship now.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no we're not... we're going to talk... all night...}
<A>__{bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable smile we have yet seen on his face.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{so... where do you want to start?}
<A>__{bobby is silent, but still smiles his acquiescent smile. hector reads the silence well.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i know where you want to start...}
<A>__{bobby is still silent.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{alicia...}
<A>__{bobby's smile breaks into a boyish laugh.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well... what about alicia?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no... i'm sorry...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what do you mean, you're sorry... i'm the one that has to apologize...}
<A>__{bobby is mischievous now.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh no you're not...}
<A>__{it will be a worthwhile night for both of them.}
