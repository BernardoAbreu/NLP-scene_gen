<ACTION_ALT>__{MAP GRIDS}
<ACTION>__{From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re- configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of forest and wilderness. Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of the suburb. The name of this housing development is "Pleasant Valley". The transparency fades out to reveal:}
<LOC>__{EXT.   PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{From a sign reading "Pleasant Valley Dream Homes", a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity. Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway. All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths. The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights. We halt outside one house.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn. Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with it's prey into the woods behind. Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He draws the curtains once again and disappears.}
<LOC>__{INT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer. KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face, pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up abruptly from his chair elated.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes!}
<ACTION>__{Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His ebullient mood changes quickly.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Damn! DELLA!}
<ACTION>__{The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening. DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent. She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans. She sees the broken doll.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll.}
<ACTION>__{She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of beer.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?}
<ACTION>__{Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him, continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group?}
<ACTION>__{He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look at her once more.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I got a new one for you.}
<ACTION>__{He smiles sardonically.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Group therapy for women who always have the curse. There's a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley Episcopalian.}
<ACTION>__{Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.}
<ACTION>__{A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches Kenneth's eye.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?}
<ACTION>__{His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain himself, faces her.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.}
<ACTION>__{He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop, looks right in her tired face.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{The last time I saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!}
<ACTION>__{She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears. He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness. She walks away clutching the doll.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm sorry.}
<ACTION>__{But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them. Kenneth turns back to his computer.}
<LOC>__{INT. STAIRS - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth, their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation, Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty something Della in a little black dress.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother. Della stands in the doorway and watches them. Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons. Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls house, starting with the furniture. She steps into the room.}
<CHAR>__{TAMMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mommy can I get an American Girl for Christmas?}
<CHAR>__{TERRI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Where are you going, Mommy?}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then Daddy will read you a bedtime story.}
<CHAR>__{TAMMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Daddy's stories are lame. I want you to read us a story.}

<DIAL>__{No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot Kitty.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tomorrow night I'll read you the best bedtime story in the whole world. I promise.}
<ACTION>__{Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I'll check in on you both when I get back.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{To make sure you're sleeping.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs. Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a cloudy night sky like big stars.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.}
<ACTION>__{Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as she walks away.}
<LOC>__{INT.   STAIRWAY - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs.}
<LOC>__{INT.   HALLWAY - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots. The boots are well worn but polished to a gleam. Behind her, an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p.m. The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneth's office.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet. She looks at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks away.}
<LOC>__{INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick from Kenneth's ajar door. TITLE     ---   "WHILE SHE WAS OUT"}
<LOC>__{EXT.    DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie silence of the suburbs. She closes the door softly behind her and rushes along the path to the driveway where the family's black Ford Explorer is parked. She CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in.}
<LOC>__{INT.    FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock.    The car sputters in defiance against the cold night.}

<DIAL>__{Frick!}
<ACTION>__{The car sputters again.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{C'mon...}
<ACTION>__{With a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the vehicle starts. She sighs with relief. She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent, pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of Tammi. She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold. A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into reverse and backs up.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{We follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard. The road is empty. All the cars are neatly tucked away in their driveways and it looks like no one's out tonight. She makes a right turn onto.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY CRESCENT - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She follows the road as it curves around a long row of endlessly monotonous houses. In the distance, we can see the gates of Pleasant valley gated community.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card against the security panel. The gates slowly open. She drives through. The gates close behind her. She rolls the window up and makes a left turn onto.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{The road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls of gated communities. A Ford Explorer just like hers passes in the opposite direction.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand. She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her secret hiding place for: A nice pack of Marlboros. She smiles again - the smile of the secret smoker. She presses the cigarette lighter into the dashboard. The lighter pops out. She tips out a cigarette, sees a sticky note attached to the interior foil. Scrawled in messy handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING}
<ACTION_ALT>__{DELLA HONEY. XOXO KENNETH.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER you stop drinking.}
<ACTION>__{She rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the cigarette. She inhales deeply.     We see the pleasure written across her face.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{A few cars pass Della in the night. Their lights are like torches in the suburban wilderness.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER/ EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{There is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. Della has programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into it, like the "William Tell overture". Della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her purse with the other. She eventually locates the phone.}

<CHAR>__{MARY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Oh Della. Kenneth is always charming. At least to me.}

<CHAR>__{MARY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}

<DIAL>__{I'm just joking, Della. You know me. I pre-paid ten classes and only made it to two. If you are going I could use a ride. I'd hate to miss another class.}

<DIAL>__{Bye, Mary.}
<ACTION>__{Della stops at the red light. She clicks off the phone and lets it lay on her lap. She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat, casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock. She finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught on the bar under the passenger seat. It's only a third full but she takes a sip, recoils from its coldness. The light changes.   She throws the bottle into the back seat.}

<ACTION>__{Della slows down for another red light. She's at a wide crossroads where the housing development abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins. A billboard for another new housing development announces: "GREEN STREET DREAM HOMES - Investment Opportunities". Waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from Della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof. Della tries not to look at it. A recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead changes to green.}

A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench. She curls them around its handle and grips tight.

Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between Tomas and Huey. Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with his face down, biting on the plank's edge. Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hideous THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the space in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations below. Tomas falls away, cursing in horror.}

She follows her breath into the icy blackness. Branches and foliage scratch against her face. She grapples about, looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs. Her eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction light shines behind like a distant moon. She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees, some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the evergreens still have their foliage. Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys. Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may be the right place to hide. She stops for a second to catch her breath. The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She changes hands. God, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death. It could have been her. There has to be some way out of this nightmare. Ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path. She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.}

The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage. She holds still, terrified. The flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots. Della stops breathing. Then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods. She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her hiding place. She creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if they're in the woods now she should get out. Her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates the edge of the wood. She heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. She steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer. The construction light grows closer. The light abruptly goes out. She stops, eyes desperately searching the trees. She resumes in the direction she was headed. Tries to keep calm. But the woods are impenetrable. Layers of trees and shrubs, and then more trees. Deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow. She's losing her bearings.}

It's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the clearing. A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of beer in hand. Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face. The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She creeps along the edge of the trees. As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles downhill into the gulch. She freezes. But nobody notices. She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas enters the clearing. Tomas stops and watches Vinh. Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that this is really important music to him. It's a theatrical tableau - Della overhead, looking down on the clearing. Vinh transfixed by the music. Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh. It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated. Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small tear runs down his stoic face. Then CLICK.

She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels something in her pants pocket. She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper. She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the beginning. The stick figure family holding hands and "Mommy - We love you" written in stars. Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly separate. That the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The stars clear and bright. The words... A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A sob. She might never see her kids again. Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion. More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back. Wills herself to stop. Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self recrimination. Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note!

<LOC>__{EXT.   STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream below. She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed clutching the toolbox. The water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds like glass breaking. The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered for all time. She's talking to herself in a whisper.}

<DIAL>__{Please, I just want to see my babies again.}
<ACTION>__{Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her. This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She needs to get moving. She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily. The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods. She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. Forging ahead. She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up. She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed. A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it. She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream. More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat. She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox. She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home. She swallows another wave of grief. The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She follows it, picks the left fork. And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her. She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her life. The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running. Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster. She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap behind her. She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees. Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes, right into Vinh's face. He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries out, covers his eyes.}

<DIAL>__{Aaaarrhh.}
<ACTION>__{This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her. But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her. Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction. Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five feet behind her. A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun. Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever. The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   EMBANKMENT - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will allow. The boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her. She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by. If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it. All of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens hard for their footfalls. Nothing.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PINE TREE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree. She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver. She removes it from the box and grasps it tight. Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk. She peeks between the branches. No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the tree, branch by branch. The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little needles, fall like a jagged veil around her. She waits. She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape below despite the darkness. She makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.}

Vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his footing. He plods past the tree. She slips the screwdriver up her sleeve. Prays he won't stop. She pulls herself further up the tree. A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed by a shower of pine needles. Her heart stops. A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by the squawking of angry birds. She's disturbed a bird's nest. She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between. The crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus. She looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches along a branch to see better. The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line, disorienting her. She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree. Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her. She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath. The flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away up the embankment. But Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up through the branches. Their eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie. She LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back.}

Della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve. She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull. Vinh screams. She thrusts and twists the tool. All the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover. She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood. His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. They roll downstream. His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down. She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her. She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off. She crawls out from under his body. Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again. She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her. Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark. There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around. It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below. Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be seen now that's for sure. She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and roots as she goes. Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing, reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up. Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness. She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.}

She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough. His legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt. Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle. His body surrenders to death. She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal. His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently. And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float away. Somehow she stands up. She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood. She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket closed. She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway. It's time to go home.}

That place where the rest of the world meets the woods. She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a curtain to her other reality, the one she almost left behind. The housing development is still there and not more than a hundred feet away is her car. She hears the sound of distant sirens.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She hurries across the clearing towards her car. Sees the trunk is open. Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about. Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine. She quickly gathers them, stuffs them in her purse. A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's locked? What if the keys are gone? She presses the Ford's driver door handle and much to her relief, it opens. She sees the keys still dangling from the ignition.}
<LOC>__{INT. EXPLORER- EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No connection. No surprises there!}
<LOC>__{EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again. The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give way but the bigger one won't budge. She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches. The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in. She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping. She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood slams down after it.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real. Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive and plows down the rough gravely road.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She passes the Plymouth on her way. Sees its wheels lodged deep in the mud. Keeps going.}
<LOC>__{EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate, slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves. Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind. The lights of the mall grow closer.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER- EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches out on to the road and commits to her return to "civilization".}
<LOC>__{EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{The road's empty.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She punches the accelerator, drives just over the speed limit.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{The concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands ahead on her left. She slows, ahead there's a small traffic jam at the entrance to the Mall road.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She hears the siren before she sees the police car. God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen, the fucked up side of the Ford.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance road blocked off.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Of course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard. She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime. Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they come for her? She's got to get back to the kids. Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face looks back.}
<CHAR>__{DELLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh my.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood. And her clothes! While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex. She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror, some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only slightly better. The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance. She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road. She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this. She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to sixty. Runs a light.}
<LOC>__{EXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{As long as the roads empty she's gonna own it.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road. With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse. She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it away.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She drives through the crossroads.}
<LOC>__{INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand. Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes the driver stares at her car. She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five. The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy. The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates of Pleasant valley Dream Homes. She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But she's in. She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard. When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like it's made of stone. She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat. She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat. She turns off the ignition. She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the ignition. She glances at the gun. She looks at the house; it all looks normal. She takes a deep breath. She moves to get out of the car. She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She finds her chub card inside. She sighs.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow. The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in the front door lock. Pushes open the door.}

<DIAL>__{Where the hell have you been?}
<ACTION>__{Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice welcome. She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into the house. There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him.}

<ACTION>__{She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression. She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what to do, so he takes a swig of beer.}

<ACTION>__{Della sighs, calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket, looks him right in the eye, points the barrel at his face. He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across his face. But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night. She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK He recoils. But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew there were no bullets left. But the click echoes throughout the silent house.}
