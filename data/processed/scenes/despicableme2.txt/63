<L>__{int: shopping mall day}
<A>__{the girls are at the mall fountain. agnes has her eyes closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's really concentrating on something. there is something in her tightly clenched fist. she tosses a penny. then opens her eyes, waiting for her wish to come true. then edith emerges from the water wearing a diving mask and snorkel, hands full of coins.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{is that stealing?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{not if my wish was that i would get a lot of free coins.}
<A>__{margo is busy texting. then something offscreen catches her eye. it's a boy. this is antonio. suave, cool, and a bit dangerous. we watch in slow motion as he strolls behind the fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water. margo looks for antonio. backs into the fountain and nearly falls into it.}
