<A>__{terrell waves him frantically forward. as chekov moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down. angle their pov a ruined series of man made structures, half buried in sand. they look at each other in consternation. chekov is worried; something about all this is familiar. they descend towards the structures, now seen to be the wreckage of some sort of space craft. they pass but do not notice the federation logo, half buried next to their feet.}
