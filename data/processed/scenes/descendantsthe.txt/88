<D>__{i could.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just got off the phone with dr. johnston. they did what they had to do a couple hours ago. they've moved her to another floor. they say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. she's doing okay.}
<A>__{alexandra nods at this news and looks off. matt joins her in gazing out at hanalei bay.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{so how are you doing, alex?}
<C>__{alexandra}

<D>__{no, i mean other than that. in general. you haven't been using, have you?}

<D>__{so you just stopped? really?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{look, dad, it's no big deal. kids do drugs and they stop. unless they're like super ghetto. and you sent me to boarding school, remember? i couldn't get anything anymore. so no, i'm not doing any drugs. but i still think they're fun. okay, maybe a little pot once in a while.}

<D>__{yeah, there is. we shipped you off. let them handle it. and now you're here, helping with scottie, helping me. thanks.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you want to know what really pisses me off? that she wouldn't end it. not even when she knew she was busted. how are we supposed to feel about that?}

<D>__{i guess she really liked him.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{so how are we going to find this guy, sherlock?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{right. well, why don't you two take scottie to the beach? i'm going to call around a little. we're on an island, for christ's sake. everything's just one degree of separation.}
