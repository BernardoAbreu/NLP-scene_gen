<L>__{exterior road to calais night}
<A>__{fog drifts across a lonely stretch of road. suddenly: pounding hoofbeats come over the scene. music swells. and galloping out of the fog come d'artagnan and the three musketeers, riding hell for leather. hold on this heroic tableau for a long beat.}
<L>__{exterior bridge on road to calais night}
<A>__{four rough looking mercenaries crouch on a low bridge spanning a shallow stream. they are armed with muskets and swords. the mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper eagerly among themselves. one of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends. and the sound of hoofbeats is heard in the distance. faint, but growing closer.}
<C>__{mercenary}
<D>__{shoot low. we'll need their heads for identification.}
<A>__{the mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. right on cue, four horsemen come thundering out of the mist. but just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half one pair rides to the left, the other to the right. before the mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream. in a flash, they return to the road, and race away. having avoided the bridge completely. cursing, the angry mercenaries whirl about, fire at d'artagnan and the three musketeers as they ride into the night. porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.}
