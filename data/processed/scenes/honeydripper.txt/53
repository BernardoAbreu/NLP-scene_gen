<C>__{ty}
<D>__{the piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up and i figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. and he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever }
<A>__{ty plays something like a minuet }
<C>__{ty}
<D>__{ him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. this old boy, the first one, he can play alla them africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music.}
<C>__{maceo}
<D>__{down to the bones }
<C>__{ty}
<D>__{and one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench }
<C>__{maceo}
<D>__{watch out now }
<C>__{ty}

<A>__{a silence. maceo is moved by the scene }
<C>__{maceo}
<D>__{would have liked to been there. i mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.}
