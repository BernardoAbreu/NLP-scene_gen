<L>__{interior tudor's apartment morning}
<A>__{in his bathroom, nicholas tudor is cleaning his teeth with microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed water device called a water pick. tudor is thirty nine, not happy with his work as an insurance appraiser, and has recently adopted a general air of terse, sullen desperation as his primary mood. his wife, janine, calls to him from the kitchen, where she is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{breakfast is just about ready, nick.}
<A>__{tudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water pick until he is completely satisfied. he carefully packs the machine away, then leaves the bathroom. in the dining room, janine is putting breakfast on the table. tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. janine returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee in each hand. she puts one cup in front of tudor, sits down, starts to drink the other one. after a pause, she speaks.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{can i call you at the office?}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{what do you want to call me at the office for?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{i won't be at the office except to sign in.}
<P>__{(he eats heartily,}
<D>__{not looking directly}
<P>__{at janine)}
<D>__{i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.}
<P>__{(noticing janine's}
<D>__{silence, he finally}
<P>__{looks up)}
<D>__{i will come home right after work.}
<A>__{janine continues to toy with the food in her plate. she shrugs once, as if to say, 'big deal, so what?' tudor ignores her and finishes breakfast.}
