<D>__{there had to be a second man. i was struck from behind, i remember. it's about the last thing i do remember. but the police didn't believe me.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{how did they explain what you remembered? the gun and stuff?}

<P>__{(points at conclusions on back of file)}
<D>__{john g. was clever. he took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. he left my gun and left the getaway car. he gave the police a complete package. they found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. they didn't need to look for anyone else. i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and i had brain damage.}

<D>__{oh, one thing.}
<A>__{natalie turns. leonard snaps her picture with his polaroid camera. he lowers the camera and smiles.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{something to remember you by.}
<A>__{natalie smiles unconvincingly, perturbed, and exits. leonard sits down on the couch and writes "natalie" on the white strip under her photo as it develops into the blurred image of natalie which we have seen before. he takes out his other polaroids, flipping through them.}
