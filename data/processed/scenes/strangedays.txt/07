<L>__{70's van. there are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled}
<A>__{inside the van. lenny has a haliburton case open next to him, like a drug dealer. in fact the whole setup looks like a drug deal, but it's not. though it is illegal. the case holds lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes, and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals. they are about the size of dat tapes, and hold about 30 minutes of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears, and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at the moment it is happening.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{how'd you get the tape? why didn't the cops put it in evidence?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{with all the blood i guess they didn't see the rig. guy had it under a wig.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, but how'd it get to you?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{i got ways, lenny, i got ways.}
<P>__{(off lenny's impatient look)}
<D>__{okay, okay... i got a deal with some a the paramedics. my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue. so whaddya think? this clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. right?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tick. not to dash your hopes, but i don't deal this kind of product, you know that. i will give you four for it, cause i've gotta cut off the last bit. and my customers want uncut.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{fuck that! the last part's the best. you dry dive six stories and blammo! jack right into the big black.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i don't deal black jack clips! it's policy. i got ethics here.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{yeah, when did that start? come on, man! it's what people want to see, and you know it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{so lay it off to somebody else.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{come on, lenny. i got expenses. i got to get this rig fixed. look at it...}
<A>__{tick holds up a zip lock bag containing the walkman sized stainless steel cortical resonance recorder, the record deck we saw earlier in the pov. also in the bag is the squid net, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the human head (this is different from playback trodes). the whole works are covered with congealed blood.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{give me six at least. this's a good clip, here. gets you pumpin'.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, well, the first part's okay. better than the usual soaps you bring me.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{now that is cold, lenny. i always bring you choice.}
<A>__{lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at tick's feet, pulling out a tape.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{sure, like this low grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test pattern. nothing happens. i'm snorin'.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{hey, you're always saying, 'bring me real life. bring me street life. and, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's technicolor.'}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i said that? look, i will take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{ha! that's for fucking sure.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what else you got?}
