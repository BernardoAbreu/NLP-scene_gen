<A>__{yle is asleep in his crib. the door cracks open, emitting light from the hall, turning lisa into a silhouette. she enters the room, silent as a ghost, and approaches kyle's crib. she stands over him, smiling down at the vulnerable sleeping child. then, lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror. she takes out a tube of red lipstick and applies it to her lips.}
