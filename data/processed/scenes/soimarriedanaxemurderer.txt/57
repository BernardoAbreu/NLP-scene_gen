<D>__{i know, charlie. and it's not just that. look at the things people are doing. partners killing each other... i mean, you hear a story like that, and... who can you really trust these days?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, "what if i pushed him?"}

<A>__{charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him.}
<C>__{harriet}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{look at you, you're sleeping. look how vulnerable you are. i mean, i could do anything at that pointerior}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{what could you do?}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(sweet and innocent)}
<D>__{anything. you're lying on your side, asleep, i could... stick a needle in your ear.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(grabbing his ear at the thought)}

<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. goodnight, sweetheart.}

<A>__{she doesn't close her eyes. he's scared to close his. pause.}

<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{they both look over at each other. she closes her eyes. he takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes. and covers his ear with his hand.}
