<A>__{they're drained, tired, in a large rehersal living room 30 feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the beach at marina. the room is filled with golden, gorgeous setting sunlight. pamela goes to the kitchen with dorothy, ray's japanese fiancee.}
<C>__{robbie}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{we don't need a bridge.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{yeah, we could maybe improvise a couple piano and guitar solos over it}
