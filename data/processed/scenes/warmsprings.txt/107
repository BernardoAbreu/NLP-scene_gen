<C>__{sara}
<D>__{he wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that... leper colony!}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{franklin has invited louis and me to see the work he's been doing.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{work! playing in a pool all day long? squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers? i consider this your fault, eleanor!}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, mama?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you have indulged him and this is the result.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<P>__{(challenging her)}
<D>__{indulged him? i have indulged him?}
<A>__{sara looks away.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{he's a grown man who makes his own decisions.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{but he does not need to buy it.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{if it's of any comfort to you, i agree.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm against it as well. it will consume too much of his time and energy.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{then it is settled. we tell him no.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{no, it is not settled. we must hear him out. louis and i must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and tell him no.}
<A>__{they all look at each other for a moment. for once they agree.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{perhaps i have underestimated you.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{perhaps you have. but that has been my fault, not yours.}
