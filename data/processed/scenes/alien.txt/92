<A>__{the door slides open, and they step into the room. hunter activates the bed, and it slides out of the wall. there is a long, horrified pause.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{it's gone.}
<A>__{they rush to broussard's prone form. the parasite is gone from his}
<B>__{face.}
<A>__{broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing. his face is}
<B>__{covered with sucker marks.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{now we're in for it.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{the door was closed. it must still be in here.}
<A>__{they immediately grow very tense. hunter starts edging toward the door. standard grabs his arm.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{no, don't open the door. we don't want it escaping.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(very nervous)}
<D>__{well, what the hell good can we do in here? we can't grab it it might jump on us }
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{maybe we can catch it.}
<A>__{standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{as long as we're careful not to damage it...}
<A>__{tray in one hand, lid in the other, standard begins moving slowly around the room. there are very few places to hide. he bends down and peers under the bunk. as he is down on his hands and knees, we see one tentacle of the thing, vibrating on a ledge just above standard. he rises, and his shoulder brushes the tentacle. the parasite drops to}
<B>__{the floor.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(leaping back)}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{but the thing is not moving. it lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up. its color has faded to a dead looking grey. without taking his eyes off the thing, standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall. he prods the thing; it does not respond.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{i think it's dead.}
<A>__{with great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray. then he quickly closes the lid.}
