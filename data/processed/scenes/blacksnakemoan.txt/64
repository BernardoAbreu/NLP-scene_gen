<L>__{interior lazarus' home day}
<A>__{snot and spittle has run down the side of rae's face her eyelids stick together as she tries to open them. there is a creak, followed by another. rae has become aware that someone is slowly walking up the front porch. the door opens. silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a white man in his 40's. his face is indistinguishable to rae's affected gaze. is this a dream? he stands above her and lights a cigarette. the zippo lighter clasps shut. the man lowers it to his side where rae can see it clearly. a bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight that makes rae's eyes open wide in horror. her breath grows deeper a girlish plea. this is no dream it's a nightmare.}

<D>__{mm mm... mm mm...}
<A>__{a massive hand slaps down over her mouth. her crusted eyes peer above the hairy knuckles. he sucks on the cigarette. a red cherry blazes at the end. the man pushes the blanket off of her and grips her panties. rae's eyes close. she knows what is nexterior in his clenched fist, the panties are ripped off.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{nooooo!}
<A>__{rae flinches awake from the fever induced nightmare and falls to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat. weakened and shaking, she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen. her hand reaches out and lands on the strings of laz's guitar on the floor. she grips the steel strings with her trembling fingers. a single bass note twangs as she passes out.}
