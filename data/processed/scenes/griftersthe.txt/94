<C>__{cole}
<D>__{here you are! two rich people!}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{i must admit, mister fellowes, i had moments i was worried.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you brought a case? good.}
<A>__{cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches in, brings out a stack of bills. the door opens and two men in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a badge. (these are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hold it right there!}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(cool outrage)}
<D>__{what? this is a private office!}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{fbi! stock fraud, tampering with exchange communications }
<A>__{cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{oh, my god! no! the scandal!}
<A>__{the second man approaches hebbing, pencil and notebook at the ready, manner cold and tough.}
<C>__{second man}
<D>__{your name?}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{my ? i don't i only }
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(screams at myra)}
<D>__{you! you and your goddamn big mouth!}
<C>__{kyra}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{henry, no, i }
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{who did you tell? who?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{just one or two of the girls, just, they wouldn't }
<A>__{cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{don't move!}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{mister fellowes, that isn't going to do you any good. put that down, and }
<A>__{cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at myra.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you ruined me! you destroyed me!}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{henry, no!}
<A>__{cole shoots her, the sound very loud, the men flinching away. myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her fingers. in terror, she turns toward hebbing, who stares at the blood seeping down her white blouse. she tries to speak, can't. she reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. she topples forward. hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to the floor. cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{get back! get back!}
<A>__{the men warily move away from the door.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i will kill the first one that follows me!}
<A>__{cole runs from the room. the two men pull guns from hip holsters under their coat tails. hebbing, kneeling beside myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through. hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it locked. he crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously creeps from the room. myra sits up.}
