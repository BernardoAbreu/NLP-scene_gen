<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{what is it then? to mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. to destroy them. so everybody's not brilliantly talented. they're still people. they deserve respect and compassion. i mean, who the hell are you? what the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses? oh, i forgot, you created the dating game. wow, right up there with the sistine chapel. i guess that's what gives you the right to...}
