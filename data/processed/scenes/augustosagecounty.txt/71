<D>__{it's late, the house still. we move through dark rooms, drawn to the murmur of sound and a faint sound coming from outside the kitchen }
<C>__{jean }
<D>__{you weren't kidding, this stuff is strong.}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{florida, baby. number one industry.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{who cares? slowly discover: jean and steve sharing a joint, out by the fence. she wears a long t shirt; he wears sweat pants and a sleeveless t shirt. both are barefoot.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{number one by far. want a shotgun?}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{you don't know what a shotgun is?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{i know what a shotgun is.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{not that kind of shotgun, here. just put your lips right next to mine and you inhale while i exhale.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{okay. he puts the joint in his mouth, lit end first. their lips nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a steady stream. she nearly chokes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{hold it. don't let it out. she finally gasps, exhales, coughs.}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{that's a kick, huh?}
