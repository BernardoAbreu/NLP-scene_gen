<A>__{hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.}
<L>__{interior hexagonal stone lab day}
<A>__{hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. manning moves along behind him. the record finishes playing. silence swish!!! kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping into manning's arm. as kroenen goes in for the kill hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. kroenen bears down but hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate blocks. kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{screw that.}
<A>__{hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. bammmm!!!! he punches kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, smashing its lenses.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{you killed my father }
<A>__{bammm!!!! another hit. kroenen staggers back with each blow. finally, the mask falls off.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{give your soul to god, your ass is mine.}
<A>__{an asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. kroenen is laughing.}
