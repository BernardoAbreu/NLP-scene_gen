<L>__{interior gymnasium day}
<A>__{an edwardian nautilus room. there are machines we recognize, and some don't. a woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking rediculous. thomas andrews is leading a small tour group, including rose, ruth and cal. cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained stroke.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{reminds me of my harvard days. t.w. mccauley, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present day counterpart on an "abflex" infomercial. he hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to undulate. rose puts her hand on it, curious.}
<C>__{mccauley}
<A>__{the electric horse is very popular. we even have an electric camel.}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<A>__{care to try your hand at the rowing, m'am?}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{don't be absurd. i can't think of a skill i should likely need less.}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{the next stop on our tour will be bridge. this way, please.}
