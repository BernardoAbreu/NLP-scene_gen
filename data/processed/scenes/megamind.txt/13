<A>__{the beam hits the observatory. the building instantly explodes in a white nova blast of fire.}
<L>__{interior hydrofoil control room day}
<A>__{the blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window. then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out. one by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out toward the observatory. all we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and smoke.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i don't think even he could have survived that.}
<A>__{einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{whoa! is it me or did you just finally destroy uberman?}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(carefully skeptical)}
<D>__{well...let's not get ahead of ourselves.}
<A>__{da vinci suddenly sees something outside.}
<C>__{da vinci}
<D>__{look, there's something in the sky, coming this way.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{uberman!}
<A>__{master mind turns toward the window. an object is in the air, flying directly toward them. as it closes in we can just make out the familiar outline of a}
<B>__{capped figure.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i knew it! prepare yourselves! he's gonna ram us!!!}
<A>__{everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact. master mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know what to do with himself. he just covers his giant head with his hands. the figure crashes through the window and lands at his feet. he looks down to see a charred black human skeleton. around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of uberman.}
<C>__{master mind }
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{roxanne breaks out of da vinci's hold and runs over to the body.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{uberman?}
<A>__{she stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow "u" on it. roxanne turns to master mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{you killed him!}
<A>__{roxanne's eyes roll back. da vinci catches her from behind as she faints. einstein turns to master mind, looking at him as if he's just walked on water.}
<C>__{einstein}

<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{...so i did.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i mean, i know you always wanted to. i mean, all the schemes all the plots i never thought you'd actually be capable of it.}
<A>__{giddy as a school girl, einstein turns to his fellow henchmen.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{this is history. every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually ever happen?}
<A>__{a sudden realization comes over his face.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{good lord...you do all realize what we get to do now, don't you?}
<A>__{his question is met with acquisitive looks from master mind and the others.}

<A>__{it's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something they're flying high above the city streets. we pull back to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a brain copter. inside the cockpit master mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally. spinning headline: "champion less city at the mercy of hooligans."}
<B>__{metro city bank}
<A>__{da vinci and einstein run out the front of the bank holding}
<B>__{bags of money.}
<A>__{two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley. after a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a giant robot chases after them. the robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with master mind and plato at the driver's wheel. they smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done. spinning headline: "master mind blackmails metro!!!"}
<B>__{a vicious tornado}
<A>__{it's heading for downtown metro as master mind and the lackeys coolly look on. three large dump trucks pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of cash. the drivers jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. master mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(absentmindedly)}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<A>__{master mind pulls a television remote from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. he presses the button marked "tornado off." the tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. as they drive through the city streets, master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. is it melancholy?}
