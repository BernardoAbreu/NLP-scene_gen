<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the atlantic ocean lap at the shoreline. boats bob on the water. stray bottle rockets trace through the night sky. in the distance, the neon lights of an amusement park flash and zip. behind brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements for sparta filling their billboards. brendan continues walking, then spots tommy coming toward him. the brothers make eye contact. stop. then approach each other warily.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{been looking all over for you. how's it going?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{it's going.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i don't drink coffee. whattya want?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you don't want to go sit down somewhere?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i'm good right here.}
<A>__{brendan looks at tommy. sees how rigid he is. a long silence. finally brendan cuts right to it.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{shit, tommy. how was i supposed to know i was never gonna see you guys again?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you were briefed. you had the information. you chose the old man and the girl.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{she wasn't some girl. i married her. she's my wife.}
<A>__{brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent christmas photo of tess, emily, and rosie from his wallet.}
<C>__{brendan }
<P>__{(handing tommy the picture)}
<D>__{that's tess. and that's emily and rosie. they're your nieces, tommy.}
<A>__{tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't know `em.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i know you don't know them. of course you don't know them.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{why am i looking at pictures of people i don't know?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{because that's my family.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and who are you exactly?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'm your brother, man.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you were in the corps?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i said i didn't know you were in the corps.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i wasn't in the corps.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{then you ain't no brother to me. my brother was in the corps.}
<A>__{with that, tommy walks briskly away from brendan and up the beach. his brother runs after him.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{jesus, tommy. i was a 16 year old kid. what the hell did i know?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i don't know what you know. why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{she's my wife, tommy. so that's it? i stay with tess and i never get to see you guys again? not a single phone call? nothing?}
<A>__{no response from tommy. he's a wall.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{god, man, i don't understand this. you won't forgive me, but you'll forgive pop?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{shit. he's just some old vet i train with. he means nothing to me. from what i hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's got nothing to do with forgiveness. i've got a family to protect. everything i do is for them.}
<A>__{tommy smirks. walks away again.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{but i forgave pop. just like i forgave you and mom.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(turning around)}
<D>__{you forgave us?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i'm not surprised you made the tournament, brendan. you got some stones.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i fell in love, tommy. what the hell was i supposed to do?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you were supposed to stick to the plan. you were supposed to come with us. mom needed you. i needed you. you were my big brother and you bailed on me.}
<A>__{the words hit brendan hard.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{hey, i'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, brendan. see, you leave, you get the opposite. you leave, you get to bury people.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you're not the only one who suffered, tommy. i didn't even know she was sick. i never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. you had no right to keep that from me! that was not your decision to make!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you know what? you walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, i forgive you, i forgive pop. i forgive everyone. but you know what? you're full of shit.}
<A>__{tommy and brendan are right in each other's faces. standing on the knife's edge of violence. they hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{are we done, brendan? are we finished?}
<A>__{tommy and brendan look at each other with burning intensity. too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say. finally, tommy turns and walks on down the beach.}
