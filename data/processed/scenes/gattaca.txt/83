<A>__{jerome unlocks eugene's condo and wheels his chair inside. we see their reflection in a full length mirror as jerome pushes eugene to the bedroom. after removing eugene's soiled clothing, he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(maudlin, sobbing like a child)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(attempting to comfort)}
<D>__{it's okay, eugene.}

<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{ what car? go to sleep.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{ i walked right in front of it. i was never more sober in my life.}
<A>__{jerome looks at eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his shock at the revelation.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(grabbing jerome by the collar)}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, vincent.}
<A>__{eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(smiling to himself)}
<D>__{you must be drunk to call me vincent.}
<A>__{but eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again. jerome pulls a blanket over him. on the verge of leaving, jerome's attention is drawn to a wall on the far side of the room. approaching the wall, near eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir coming from inside the adjacent condominium. jerome contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.}
