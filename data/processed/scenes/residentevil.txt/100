<L>__{int freight shaft timeless}
<A>__{rebecca rises through the ceiling.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{we're almost there. you'll have to jump off. the belt won't stop.}
<A>__{as the echo of ada's voice rings off, rebecca looks up and... ...screeee... something dives down on her out of the darkness. she ducks, almost losing her balance. she clings to the chain as other things...black, relatively small.. .whip past her head.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{bats! there are bats in here!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no. they're crows! infected! don't let them bite you!}
<A>__{rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past her. looking up, she sees more coming. she aims her m 16 and fires up the shaft. two birds are hit. they plummet. one hits ada. she swats it aside. it drops all the way down to rosie, who jumps, gasping, when it hits her.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{rats. flying rats!}
<A>__{beneath her, rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from level "b"... they circle, then start to fly up again. rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead. another bird dives from above and... skit... takes a chunk out of rosie's cheek.}
<C>__{rodriguez }
<D>__{aaah ! you fucker !}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(from above) you alright?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{yeah. i'm cool. i'm... cool.}
<A>__{rosie keeps firing. the deafening sound of her m 16 keeps her from hearing a... ...krattch...in the sheet metal wall. a second later... ...rrrrrippp! the metal is torn open like tissue paper. something dark lunges from the opening. it's the surviving hunter! one of its steel claws grabs the chain drive. the mechanism stops dead. quick cuts: of the escapees slipping, nearly falling, as they hang on to the chain.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i thought it wasn't supposed to stop.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{climb out. out!}
<A>__{rebecca has nearly reached level "a"... she's able to hoist herself up, and roll to safety. ada tries to climb. the chain is greasy. her hands slip. below, the hunter lets go of the mechanism. the chain jerks. the escapees nearly lose their balance again. rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the hunter's free hand. she jumps down. barely catching the next set of prongs beneath her. at the top, ada reaches level "a". rebecca catches her and pulls her up onto level "a.. jill is next, rising slowly. rebecca and ada reach down and grab her arms just as... tchung... the mechanism stops again. the hunter has grabbed the chain again. its free hand swings, clutching at rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture. jill is pulled to safety. she turns and reaches down for chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on the grease.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{rosie!?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i'm alright!}
<A>__{she's not alright. she's trapped. she can't get up past the hunter. she fires at the thing. bullets bounce off its protective steel under hide. chris climbs three feet. slides back two. the others reach down from above. their hands come within inches, but can't quite catch hold of him.}
<C>__{rodriguez }
<D>__{here! here, you... lizard. you fuckin' cockroach, here!}
<A>__{straining to reach rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain for a second, then latches on again. that second lifts chris to within reach of jill and the others. they grab his arms. lift him up. that second has also brought rosie within reach of the hunter. its claws comb her hair as she tries to duck lower while keeping her balance on the prongs. thwakk! something crashes through the wall. a monstrous claw that impales the hunter. it's the claw of the tyrant! the chain mechanism begins to rise again. rosie, cringing, is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught. disappointed, the tyrant scrapes the hunter off its claw. it drops away down the shaft. the tyrant turns its clicking, dilating eyes up at rosie, and...tchunnngg...purposely stops the rising chain.}

<P>__{(calling up) bad news, guys. this}
<D>__{thing's not so stupid!}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(from above) climb, rosie!}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{no. i'm finished. i live here now.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{rosie, nooooo!}
<A>__{rosie dives off the prongs...directly at the tyrant. with another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic claw, crushing her ribs. with blood spurting from her mouth, she utters her last words...}
