<L>__{interior corky's apartment night}
<A>__{the sex. there is nothing flower scented or out of focus about it. it is sweaty, slippery, body grinding, bed squeaking lesbian sex pungent and potent and when it is over, neither woman can move. finally, corky's eyes flutter open.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i can see again.}
<A>__{violet smiles. slowly, corky gets up and goes to the fridge. she grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. after a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere. eyes closed, she lets out a long "ahh." violet hears the sizzle pop of the beer as corky returns to the bed. she holds the beer to violet's lips and tilts the can, watching violet's throat as she drinks. violet's eyes open.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... i needed that.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{corky hands her the beer as violet sits up a bit.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{caesar's mafia, isn't he?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you have to ask?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{funny, nobody calls it that anymore. caesar calls it "the |business."}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how did you meet him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{they took over a club i was working at. caesar started managing it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he's a launderer?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{basically.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how long have you been with him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{almost five years.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{five years is a long time.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{corky stares at her beer. she knows what violet is thinking.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the redistribution of wealth.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{isn't that what you wanted to know? what i did time for?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{the redistribution of wealth?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{that's what i tell someone when i'm trying to get them in my bed.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm already in your bed.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. she was always more honest than me.}
<A>__{corky sips her beer.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i started stealing when i was little. we were piss poor, which is not an excuse, just a fact.}
<A>__{it isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone she just met.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the first time i remember so vividly. a bunch of us kids were at waxman's drugstore, when mr. waxman, who was a mean old prick, always worrying about us robbing him, dropped a roll of quarters.}
<A>__{we can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i can still hear that sound, those quarters, because right then something clicked inside of me. some instinct took over and as everyone, including waxman, dove down, i reached up and emptied the cash register.}
<A>__{violet smiles. she likes this woman.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i gave most of the money to my mom. i told her i found it at the trainyard. she was so happy she cried, calling me her lucky charm. fifteen years later, i guess my luck ran out.}
<A>__{sbe swallows that with beer.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sometimes i tell myself that i didn't have a choice, that stealing was surviving. usually i can admit that's bullshit. i did it because it was a way out. it was easy and i was good at it, real good.}
<A>__{she glances at violet.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't usually talk this much. i guess i have been rehabilitated.}
<A>__{violet laughs.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i guess i wanted to.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm glad you did.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{so am i.}
