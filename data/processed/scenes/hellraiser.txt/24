<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(smiles; he's pleased)}

<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<A>__{a church bell rings. off screen, we hear voices: two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with larry masterminding the manoeuvres. we hear their efforts, but we don't yet see them. our interest is in julia, who is unpacking a tea chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{we're not going to get it in.}
<P>__{2nd man (o.s.)}
<D>__{tip it! tip it!}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{wait! wait! watch the fucking paint work.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{look, do you want the bed in or not?}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{just take it slowly.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{oh, sod you.}
<P>__{2nd man (o.s.)}
<D>__{eh, chas, slow it down like the man says.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{it'll go in. 1st man famous last fucking words.}
<A>__{julia's face through this has been almost devoid of expression. she's holding so many feelings inside; deep inside. now she moves from one box to another, and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric a brac. she picks it up and goes through into the hallway. the bell continues to ring.}
