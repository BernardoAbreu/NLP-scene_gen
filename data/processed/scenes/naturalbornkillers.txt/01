<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{the loudness of the rockabilly song slaps sonny and otis in their faces as they walk inside the door. the sexy sight of mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{good god almighty. what the hell is that?}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{that's a bitch outta hell, son.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{miller, mabel.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{comin' up.}
<A>__{otis stands in front of mallory, trying to copy what she's doing. her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him. mabel sets the miller down in front of sonny. sonny takes a swig, enjoying the floor show.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{that's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it?}
<A>__{mickey turns from his pie and looks at sonny. his expression betrays nothing.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{her name's mallory.}
<A>__{the needle lifts off the record. the song ends. mallory opens her eyes and sees otis.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{hells bells! don't stop now sugar. i'm just getting warmed up.}
<A>__{otis gives her his best shit eating grin before turning to sonny. sonny gurgles out a laugh.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, i think she's sweet on you.}
<A>__{otis turns to mallory as she punches him hard in the face spinning him around. sonny spews his mouthful of highlife. mallory grabs the back of otis' head and smashes it down on the table, cracking the linoleum. otis buckles, dropping to his knees. sonny jumps off the counter stool, but mickey's hand clutches hold of his shoulder. sonny spins around toward mickey, loaded for bear, and points his finger at him, threateningly. before any threat can be made, mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath, and in a flash, slices off sonny's finger. sonny's finger drops on his boot. he grabs his aching hand. blood flows from the wound.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in.}
<A>__{mickey makes five lightning quick slashing swings. the buck knife slips back into its sheath. at first, there seems to be no difference with sonny. finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest. sonny collapses. the short order cook charges out of the kitchen at mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming. mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and fires. bullet's pov: heading fast toward short order cook's face. it hits. short order cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming. mickey spots earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window. earl's watched the whole shebang. earl mouths 'fuck!' he turns and runs for it. mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which shatters. the knife plunges deep into earls back. he hits the ground dead. mickey turns to mallory. she's sitting on op of otis, slamming his head repeatedly on the floor.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{honey.}
<A>__{mallory looks up at mickey. she gets off otis and moves to mickey's side. mickey trains his .45 on pinball cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy boots. mickey aims at mabel, who's clutching the coffee pot, crying.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(to mallory)}
<D>__{pick one.}
<A>__{mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth from mabel to pinball cowboy.}

<D>__{eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the tow. if he hollers, let him go. eanie, meanie, minie, moe. my mom told me to pick the best one and you are it.}
<A>__{she ends, pointing at mabel. mabel's crying. she screams.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{mickey fires the .45. the bullet chinks through the coffee pot mabel's holding and explodes, thunking her in the chest. she hits the floor dead. mickey and mallory join hands and walk over to the pinball cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{when you tell people what went on here, tell 'em mickey and mallory knox did this. understand?}
<A>__{pinball cowboy nods yes. the two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths. then, holding hands, mickey and mallory walk out of the cafe.}
