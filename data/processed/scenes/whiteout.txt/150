<L>__{interior science lab continuous}
<A>__{carrie carefully follows. sees he's heading for keller's ice axe in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted lab cart pryce used to bust open the door.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc stop.}
<A>__{he does. turns back to her. but there has been a subtle shift inside him something illogical.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i will cut you in, carrie. there's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. that can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. how many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. well, this is it. those beakers finding that plane was a sign. a sign telling me it was time to go back. now i have something to go back for.}
<A>__{she has a realization.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{there is no granddaughter, is there? this was about greed, plain and simple.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no one will ever know. it's just me and you. we can take care of pryce.}
<A>__{his callus disregard for human life rocks her.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{dead is dead, right?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yes, yes, now you're getting it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what's happened to you? there are four people dead! four! people we knew.}
<A>__{doc looks at her. she's not sure if it's registering.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{where you going to stuff my body too? huh? was i going to be five?}
<A>__{he turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards it. she pulls the gun out from inside her liner, her mind a whirl of limited options and grim solutions. he nears the ice axe on the cart carrie cocks back the trigger }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{i won't go through it again. don't make me shoot you, please.}
<A>__{her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she wrestles with her emotions.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it's either ignore all of this or kill me and you and i, we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice.}
<A>__{with that...he walks right past the ice axe and into the ready room. she's confused.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc, your not thinking straight.}
<A>__{but he's not listening.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ya know, it's really warm. i'm gonna take a walk try and cool off.}
<A>__{the temperature gauge on the wall reads: 82. he looks at her.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc, please.}
<A>__{carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside door's latch. he musters a smile }
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{remember, carrie freedom's just a sunrise away.}
<A>__{using both hands on the latch, he pulls. the door blasts open, filling the space between carrie and doc with violent winds and blowing snow. doc's throws one last look to carrie, then takes two steps out the door. disappears into the blanket of white. wind and cold storm into the room against carrie, who remains standing still like a statue. emotionally drained. numb. freezing to death tears frozen to her cheeks. a shadow passes by her it's pryce. he's hunkered over in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the ready room. latches onto the door. it takes everything he's got, but he manages to get it closed. instant silence. cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket. approaches carrie, who remains staring at the closed door. the effects of the chill and doc's decision apparent. pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders. gently leads her away.}
