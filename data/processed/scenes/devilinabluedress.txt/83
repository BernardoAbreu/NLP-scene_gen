<C>__{daphne}
<D>__{we have different fathers. mine is white... frank doesn't even know that todd and i broke up. so far i've kept him out of all this.}
<A>__{she gets up and takes easy's cigarettes and taps one out.}
<C>__{daphne}
<D>__{see, coretta's the only one out here in l.a. besides my brother who knew about me...}
<P>__{(she lights up)}
<D>__{and about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, matthew teran. she made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that teran was a pedophile. and coretta got carried away and told her that todd carter was engaged to a colored woman. she was sorry and didn't think it would get to teran... but it did and he got a hold of my birth records.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{who killed her, daphne?}
