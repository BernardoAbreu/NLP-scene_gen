<L>__{interior andy's house living room night}
<A>__{they are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight. joan's hands encircle harry's wrist with a new watch.}
<B>__{on harry and joan}
<A>__{seated at the dining table. he is deeply morose and makes a half hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to secure the clasp. (the empty box and the card rest on the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way into the house.)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's really very nice looking, honey.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{do you like it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. i do. very much.}
<A>__{she finishes securing the watch.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah it's great and it's something i really needed, so...}
<A>__{he leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food. joan's eyes remain on him, trying to divine his mood:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{is anything wrong?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. nothing's wrong. everything's fine.}
<A>__{she resumes eating. then, desirous of drawing his atten tion, she fixes her gaze on the table top and smiles pensively, making the assumption that he is looking at her. when no response is forthcoming, she attempts a verbal solicitation:}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{you're probably wondering why i'm smiling.}
<A>__{he looks over at her:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i was just thinking that i find this moody side of you very attractive.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, uh huh.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{in fact, if you want to know, and i can see you're dying to...}
<P>__{(reaches over and caresses his back)}
<D>__{i completely adore you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, same here, honey.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{why are you all wet?}
<A>__{he lays his fork down and tries to make an awkward and difficult excursion into the truth:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, there is something i feel i gotta say here, joan, that's been preying on my mind. something i maybe should've handled a bit differently with you from the start, about this particular situation i'm in...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what situation?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, you recall i mentioned to you a while back, that i was finished...}
<A>__{socorro steps into view, addressing joan with great excitement:}
<C>__{socorro}
<D>__{senora, ven rapido. mira que estoy en las noticias de la televicion!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{... with a certain relationship, and i, more or less, am, but...}
<A>__{she motions joan to follow and disappears into the kitchen.}
