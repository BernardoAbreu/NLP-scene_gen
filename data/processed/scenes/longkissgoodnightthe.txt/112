<L>__{interior motel 2nd floor nighttime}
<A>__{a match flares as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... mr. perkins puffs mightily. turns and favors charly and henessey with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator... timothy straddles a nearby chair. smiles and says:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{good to have you back again, chuck.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{you know, colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. you don't know the rules of the game anymore.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{no shit. eight years ago, you send me to kill daedalus and this clown. now you're working with him.}
<A>__{he crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{budget cuts, remember? congress blinded us in eastern europe, central america. across the board, an intelligence blackout. we had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets.}
<A>__{pause. suddenly charly's eyes go wide. she whispers:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{budget cuts... oh, god. is that what this is about...? the foot soldiers, the tanker truck... fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!!}
<A>__{comprehension, dawning. she looks up in disbelief.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{you'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you...? all you need is a major terrorist incident.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{interesting theory.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{theory, my ass. i think some terrorists were planning a strike. bought supplies from daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming...}
<P>__{(eyes widening)}
<D>__{no way. don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, just to get a budget increase.}
<A>__{perkins shrugs philosophically.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{it's not without precedent. 1993, remember the world trade center bombing...? the cia had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was cia, they facilitated the bombing. purely to justify a budget increase. of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{that's not gonna happen this time...?}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{no. this time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. this time the terrorists can't muck it up... because we've killed them and taken over.}
<A>__{charly and henessey react, startled...}
