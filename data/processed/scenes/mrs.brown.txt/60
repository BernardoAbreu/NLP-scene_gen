<A>__{disraeli and mary anne stand with bertie and his acolytes.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{mr disraeli. ma'am.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{your royal highness. what a pleasure to see you here.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{have you met mr lyle? he's in sugar...?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i don't think i've had that pleasure.}
<A>__{disraeli shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles with drink. mary anne engages him in conversation while bertie turns disraeli aside.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{no doubt you've heard the rumors.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i take no account of gossip, your highness.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i fear the influence he has on her. the man's word is not to be credited. he is an arriviste of the very lowest water.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she's having a bust cast of him. in nero marquino marble.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me. she must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{a situation?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i don't imagine you frequent the republican clubs. but the fact that neither you nor i are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the tory party has always been our party.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i'm flattered you think so.}
<C>__{bertie}

<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i don't think we can overstate the seriousness of this.}
<A>__{disraeli nods and bertie walks swiftly back to his party. the moment he's gone, stanley steps up to disraeli's side.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what did he want?}
<C>__{disraeli}
