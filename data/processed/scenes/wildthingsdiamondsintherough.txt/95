<C>__{elena}
<D>__{the crash. he...he hit his head...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp?}
<A>__{elena has no answers as morrison takes the cuffs from his belt, snaps them on elena's wrists.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{you got the right to remain silent, which in your case is probably best, cos of the shit you come up with...}
<A>__{kristen stands up, shaking her head.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{that's two strikes, elena. one more and you're out.}
<A>__{elena looks at her pleadingly.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i will do whatever you want.}
<A>__{kristen stops. thinks for a moment. nods to morrison as he drags elena to her feet.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{yeah. yeah you will.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i will tell you the truth. i will tell you what happened. she killed him, and took the diamonds. marie, it was marie clifford...}
<A>__{morrison just sneers.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{keep bleeting, missy. all the way to the judge. i think its time he heard the truth about jay clifford's accuser.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{her arrest doesn't guarantee jay'll be cleared, you know that. you need marie, you need the proof they set him up...}
<A>__{morrison considers this.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you came so close to nailing the black widow, don't let this slip through your fingers, detective...}
<A>__{he's about to speak, when elena's cell phone rings. kristen takes it from elena, looks at the caller id, sees marie's name...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{speak of the devil...}
<A>__{she holds the phone up.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you're gonna answer it. and you're gonna say that everything went fine. no one found chad's body. the plan's still on. do you understand me?}
<A>__{elena nods slowly. morrison turns to kristen.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{you thinking what i'm thinking?}
<A>__{kristen's patient with him.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{this is your chance. feds can't take this one from you...}
<A>__{morrison weighs his options, then finally nods. kristen clicks the phone on, holds it to elena's ear.}
