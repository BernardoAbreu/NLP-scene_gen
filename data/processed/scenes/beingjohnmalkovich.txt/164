<L>__{interior craig and lotte's dining room night}
<A>__{craig, lotte, and maxine are seated at the table and eating lasagna. lotte eyes maxine. craig eyes maxine. there is an awkward silence.}
<C>__{lotte}
<P>__{(to maxine)}
<D>__{did you know that eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. it's because they have so much of it.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{after dinner i will show you my puppets.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{after that i will introduce you to my favorite monkey, elijah. he's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. but we're getting to the bottom of it.}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{psychotherapy.}
<A>__{there is another silence.}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(to no one in particular)}
<D>__{the way i see it, the world is divide into those go after what they want and those who don't. the passionate ones, the ones who go after what they want, may not get what they want, but they remain vital, in touch with themselves, and when they lie on their deathbeds, they have few regrets. the ones who don't go after what they want... well, who gives a shit about them anyway?}
<A>__{maxine laughs. there is another silence. suddenly, at the same moment, both craig and lotte lunge for maxine and start kissing her passionately about the face and neck. they stop just as suddenly and look at each other.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you?}
<A>__{lotte looks away.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{craig, i just don't find you attractive. and, lotte, i'm smitten with you, but only when you're in malkovich. when i looked into his eyes last night, i could feel you peering out. behind the stubble and the too prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, i sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.}
<C>__{craig}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{my god.}
<A>__{lotte strokes maxine's face. craig clears dishes from the table.}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(to lotte, removing her hand)}
<D>__{only to john, sweetie. i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{thanks for a wonderful dinner.}
<P>__{(walks past kitchen. to craig)}
<D>__{no hard feelings, partner.}
<A>__{maxine exits. craig and lotte look at each other.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{i want a divorce.}
