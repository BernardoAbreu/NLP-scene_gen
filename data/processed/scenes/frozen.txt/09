<A>__{the threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{look at that. see? all these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. not us. all thanks to you, baby.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{oh, now i'm "baby"? you never call me pet names.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm just not a `pet name' guy.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(to lynch)}
<D>__{he calls me "parker."}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's your name.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? like "honey" or "sweetie".}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. it was so weird. "oh, lynch! your hair is so soft! do me harder, lynch!" it was like i was throwing it to dan over here.}
<A>__{dan looks back to parker.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{see? at least i don't call you "o'neil".}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you don't touch my face enough either.}
<A>__{dan laughs.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to no one imparticular)}
<D>__{third wheel.}
<A>__{parker reaches across and playfully taps lynch.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{watch it, lynch.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{hey, that's not fair. i'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.}
<A>__{parker shoots dan a look: "oh, really?"}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{wha ? i never said that. i never said you make my life suck.}
<P>__{(then, forced)}
<D>__{sweetie.}
<A>__{after a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face. nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.}
<C>__{parker}
<B>__{e}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{aww!}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that. but last time we went i did pretty good, right?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you did awesome. i'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(to lynch's skis)}
<D>__{are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{please. snowboards are too emo for me. give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{that's what they said about rap.}
<A>__{parker removes a cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{mmm mmm. smell that fresh mountain air, huh? kind of smells like... cancer.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you know what, i am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{at least pot does something for you. cigarettes are just gross. especially out in the cold. it like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{used floss? where do you come up with this shit.}
<C>__{lynch}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{have you ever sniffed your floss? it's nasty.}
<A>__{dan and lynch both crack up at this, huge.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no, i have never why would i ever sniff my floss? why am i friends with you?}
<A>__{parker blows more smoke out.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{gimme a drag.}
<A>__{he takes her cigarette from her.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what time do you think we'll get back? i have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{oh no. she broke the rule.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{parker you just broke the first rule.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no worrying about the bullshit of real life. the whole point of this is to relax and have fun. worry about school when you get home.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but, i haven't read a }
<A>__{the chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly. the sound of the chair lift cuts out. a deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on would suddenly shut off. random skiers and boarders in the surrounding chairs express their disgust for the delay. parker instinctively grabs dan's hand.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{uh oh! is someone afraid of heights?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{so it doesn't bother you when i do this?}
<A>__{lynch rocks the chair back and forth. parker grabs hold of the safety bar.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{quit it!}
<A>__{dan motions to lynch to stop.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i'm not afraid of heights. i just don't like them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off of a lift.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, statistics don't work on smokers.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(nervous laughter)}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<A>__{lynch turns around and yells behind him.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ok, what asshole couldn't get on the chair right?}
<A>__{laughter echoes from the chairs behind him. he yells forward.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{come on, i paid good money to do some skiing!}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{actually, i paid good money.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.}
<A>__{with a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the whirring sound of the cables above them start up again. applause is heard from all of the other chairs.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{that's what i'm talking about! woo!}
<A>__{dan lets go of parker's hand and gives her a smile. she smiles back. he playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame.}
