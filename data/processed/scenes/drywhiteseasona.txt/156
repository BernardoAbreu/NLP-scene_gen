<L>__{exterior suzette's house swimming pool day}
<A>__{the immaculate blue of the pool. johan hurls himself out of the water, flops down at the side. suzette and ben nearby, sitting in the sun. pieter at the barbecue, sizzling thick steaks. a servant in white uniform soundlessly laying the table on the patio behind him. the nanny with the baby in the shade.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ how's she doing?}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{better... she's waiting for you to ask her to come home.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<A>__{she turns to ben, squinting in the sun.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{papa, i don't want to interfere...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then don't.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{i know this is going to sound strange coming from me... i mean i haven't exactly been supportive for the past months... i can't say i agree with what you've done but i respect you for what you are...}
<A>__{on johan listening.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{i'm just... destroyed by what's happening to us as a family.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{suzette...}
<C>__{suzette}
<P>__{(interrupts, squeezing his arm.)}
<D>__{please, papa, for mom's sake... for all of our sakes... let's try and patch it up.}
<A>__{ben smiles sadly at her... suzette understands. johan looks at them.}
