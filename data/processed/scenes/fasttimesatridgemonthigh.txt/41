<L>__{interior u.s. history class morning}
<A>__{we are now several weeks into the school year. mr. hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are pieces of manure.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{c... d... f... f... f... three weeks we've been talking about the platt amendment. what are you people? on dope? a piece of legislation was introduced into congress by senator john platt. it was passed in 1906. this amendment to our constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv....}
<A>__{mr. hand stops on a dime. he is like a champion hunting dog that has just picked up the scent. he scans the room.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{where is jeff spicoli?}
<A>__{there is silence in the u.s. history classroom.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{i saw him earlier today near the 200 building bathrooms. is he still on campus?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{anyone?}
<A>__{one student sitting next to stacy raises his hand.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{yes, desmond?}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{i saw him by the food machines.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{how long ago?}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{just before class, sir...}
<A>__{mr. hand snaps his fingers, hawaii five o style.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{okay. bring him in.}
<A>__{desmond hustles out the door.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{what is this fascination with truancy? what is it that gets inside your heads?}
<A>__{mr. hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks. occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down to lecture directly into the students' faces.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{there are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants.}
<P>__{(points to attendance clip on the doorway)}
<D>__{it's a little game that you both play. they pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch. who pays the price later? you.}
<A>__{desmond returns to the room with a red eyed jeff spicoli.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{hey! wait a minute! there's no birthday party for me here!}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{thank you, desmond.}
<P>__{(to spicoli)}
<D>__{what's the reason for your truancy?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i couldn't make it in time.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<P>__{(in top form)}
<D>__{you mean, you couldn't? or you wouldn't?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i don't know, mon. the food lines took forever.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{food will be eaten on your time!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{why are you continuously late for this class, mr. spicoli? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{mr. hand appears mesmerized. he then turns and heads for the board. he writes in long, large letters as he slams the chalk into the green board. he writes: "i don't know".}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{i like that.}
<A>__{he stands back and admires it. he turns randomly to stacy.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{don't you like that, miss hamilton?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{i really like that too. 'i don't know'... that's nice. 'mr. hand, will i pass this class?' 'gee, mr. spicoli, i don't know'. i like that. i think i'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy. giving you full credit, of course, mr. spicoli.}
<A>__{we hear the blare of the dismissal bell. stacy and the other students get up to leave. spicoli stays in place. he has just figured out a truly bitchin' comeback... and his mouth is forming the first word, when mr. hand cuts him off.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{you can go now.}
<A>__{hand turns back to his desk. the rest of the students have already left. spicoli's audience is gone. he shrugs and lopes out the door.}
