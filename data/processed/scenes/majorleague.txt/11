<D>__{by the way, you were with me last night. who's this girl on top of me?}
<A>__{donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{tolbert? tolbert? screw it.}
<A>__{taylor hangs up, leaving donovan staring into his phone. taylor looks up to see tolbert standing in the doorway.}
