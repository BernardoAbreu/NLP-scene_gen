<L>__{exterior street morning}
<A>__{a tram trundles down the wide berlin street. rachel and david are walking to vogel's surgery, holding hands. she's pale, very frightened. david walks, trying, and failing, to think of anything to say to her. he suddenly notices an odd sound. it's rachel, humming tunelessly to herself, very low. something about this pierces him. he gives her hand a squeeze.}
<L>__{exterior clinic day}
<A>__{the two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs leading into the clinic, their husband and wife routine.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{i will be waiting for you.}
<A>__{she nods, trying to smile.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(her throat is tight)}
<D>__{i won't...be long.}
<A>__{they kiss. she turns to go, looking so young and lost... david hesitates, staring after her, then walks quickly away. rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance.}
