<B>__{with her.}
<A>__{as she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns around, back pressed against the baron who is looking down at her. the look on her face is the look we often see on flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed. note: good introduction, for flaemmchen. the lift ascends.}
