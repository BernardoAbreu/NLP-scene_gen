<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{jacob is wheeled into a tiny room. a numer of "doctors" are waiting. as they draw closer jacob notices that something about them is not right. they bear a subtle resemblance to bosch like demons, creatures of another world. jacob tries to sit up but winces in pain. he cannot move. he tries to scream but no sound comes out. chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. they are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to jacob's arms and legs. he screams.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{the "doctors" laugh. there is the sound of a huge door closing. jacob is left in semi darkness. suddenly a new group of "doctors" emerges from the shadows. they are carrying sharp surgical instruments. they surround jacob, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. jacob is panting and sweating in fear. one of the "doctors" leans over jacob. he gasps with horror. it is jezzie.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jezzie!}
<A>__{she pays no attention to him. he stares at her, the camera tilting down her body. as it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming with maggots. the "doctors" laugh. they take great pleasure in his suffering. their voices are strange and not human. each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. the confusion of meanings is a torment of its own.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{get me out of here. "doctor" where do you want to go?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{take me home. "doctor" home?}
<P>__{(they all laugh)}
<D>__{this is your home. you're dead.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{dead? no. i just hurt my back. i'm not dead. "doctor" what are you then?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm alive. "doctor" then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know.}
<P>__{(he struggles like an animal)}
<D>__{this isn't happening. "doctor" what isn't happening?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{let me out of here! "doctor" there is no out of here. you've been killed. don't you remember?}
<A>__{a "doctor" approaches jacob. as he turns, we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets. he extracts a long needle from his belt and positions it over jacob's head. like a divining rod it locates a particular point near the crown of his head. with a powerful thrust the "doctor" shoves the needle into jacob's skull and pushes it slowly into his brain. jacob howls.}
