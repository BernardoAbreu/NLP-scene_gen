<L>__{exterior ornamental garden spa night}
<A>__{a beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen footmen. a small orchestra, playing in a temple of love, some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of trees. roderick approaches the countess.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{despite my friend's strong warning. i resolves to become acquainted with his lady. sir william cosgrove was dying. his widow would be a rich prize. why should i not win her, and, with her, the means of making in the world that figure which my genius and inclination desired? when i determine, i look upon the thing as done.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{charming lady, tell me the truth and earn my gratitude. have you a lover?}
<A>__{the countess laughs.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{have you had one?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{but, for a time... a passing fancy?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{not even that.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{not one.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{have you not a man whom you value?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{that man has, perhaps, not yet been born.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{what! you have not met a man worthy of your attention?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. i could value only someone whom i loved.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{then you have never loved? your heart is empty.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{your word "empty" makes me laugh. is it fortunate, or unfortunate? if it is fortunate, i congratulate myself. if it is unfortunate, i do not care, for i am not aware of it.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{it is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{but if, when i love, i am unhappy, i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{that is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{it is only too possible. love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{a man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i believe you, and i see i must hasten to leave, for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{by loving you, with no hope of possessing you.}
<A>__{she laughs.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{you want my heart?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{it is my only object.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{to make me wretched in two weeks.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{to love you until death. to subscribe to all your commands.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me. if i do not know it, i am innocent.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.}
<A>__{roderick laughs and kisses her.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{with a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.}
<A>__{she laughs.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{and if she does not choose to show you some kindness?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{then i will respectfully take leave of her.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{you will do as you please. it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. do you not agree?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{yes but i am afraid of being deceived.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{poor man. and, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i ask only a payment on account today after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.}
<A>__{she laughs. he kisses her again. they exit.}
