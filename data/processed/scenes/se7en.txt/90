<L>__{interior inner city cloister, stone's room afternoon}
<A>__{the door is unlocked and opened by the nun. somerset enters and bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door. it's dark. father stone, 73, is in a wheelchair. feeble and frail, eyes sunken in their sockets. he looks up at somerset.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{father stone. i'm a policeman. i'd like to ask you a few questions, if it's alright?}
<A>__{the whites of stone's eyes have yellowed. he seems to nod. somerset sits on a stool, close.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{i want to ask you about the seven deadly sins.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{the sins.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{yes, father.}
<A>__{stone reaches out a hand to touch somerset's face. stone's extremely long fingernails trail against somerset's cheek and somerset tries to hide his revulsion.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{are you one of mine?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i don't...}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{are you saved? do you have god?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i... i need to ask about the sins. do you understand what i'm saying?}
<A>__{stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{are you a sinner?}
<A>__{stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.}
<C>__{stone }
<D>__{there are sinners here. even here. and, pain waits for them. hell is hungry for them.}
<A>__{stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.}
<C>__{stone }
<D>__{they don't realize... they don't know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{fuck them all!}
<A>__{somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of stone's jagged voice. the nun goes to place a comforting hand on stone's shoulder. stone is beginning to cry.}
<C>__{nun}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{they shouldn't have let you disturb him. this shouldn't have been allowed.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{where are the children?}
<P>__{(much louder)}
<D>__{where are the children?!}
