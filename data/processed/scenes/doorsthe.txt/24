<L>__{exterior venice rooftop night}
<A>__{pam glancing through jim's notebooks as they sit on his sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television antennas. fires burn from the beach. in the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic william blake mode with writing between. books are everywhere panning kerouac, ginsberg, nietzsche, rimbaud, mailer, artaud, mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen ideas.}

<P>__{(reading, looking)}
<D>__{these are like beautiful! i never read much poetry in school. i hated it. what's a "shaman"?}
<P>__{(mispronounces)}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{he's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance. and he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. it's the same in all cultures greeks, jesus. some indians say the first shaman invented sex. he's the one who makes you crazy.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{are you a "shaman"?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{uh}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no. i just write about it. what turns you on?}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{i don't know. experience. freedom. love... now. peyote's like love. when it's given it's blessed. when it's sold it's damned. i like peyote. i like acid, it's easier to get. i like the spiritual voyage. the first time i did acid i saw god. i did. i had a friend who was christ. and he was judas too. i suddenly knew the secret of everything that we're all one, the universe is one. and that everything is beautiful.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{is it? i don't know. i think you're alive by confronting death by experiencing pain.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{i think you're alive by recognizing beauty seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing. it's "love me and i will love you."}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(looks at her, ironic)}
<D>__{it's only thru death that you know life. jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{do you love death?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i think life hurts a lot more than death. when you die the pain is over.}
<A>__{pam shivers, a strange thought.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{why do i look at you... and see my death?}
<P>__{(pause, shrugs)}
<D>__{no, that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i bet your dad's a school teacher.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{how did you know!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{what was your father?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{military}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{i bet you moved around a lot.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah, about 8 times.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{how many sisters and brothers?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{two.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{one... she's the pretty one... i love your neck.}
<P>__{(she gets in his lap)}
<A>__{he runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{"...but one, the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug"}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{that's beautiful. who did you write it for?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i wrote it for you.}
<A>__{the panties coming off. rousseau dangling from the venice moon. he moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward than we might expect.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{...take your time, jim... there's no hurry, i'm all you have to do tonight...}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{well the clock says it's time to close now i guess i'd better go now... as we depart the rooftop. your fingers weak with minarets speaking secret alphabets i light another cigarette learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget}
