<C>__{jo jo}
<D>__{so....where's gorgeous?}
<A>__{suddenly, george comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and tied, face down, to a bus cart. there is writing on his back. everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward.}
<D>__{n.s. bruglione #2 what the fuck is going on, here? s.s. bruglione #2 where's that spic barkeep? yo, pepe! where you at?!}
<A>__{as the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar in the b.g. brugliones look down on george, painted on his back...}
<D>__{s.s. bruglione #3 "erin go brah?" what the hell does that mean?}
<A>__{connor and murphy are standing 25 feet behind them.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it's irish for "you're fucked."}
<A>__{hard core music as the brugliones turn in horror. everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music. several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into george on the cart, knocking it over. george comes to. romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the salad bar. murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode. connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth. the boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain. the music cuts.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{viva la mejico, bitches!}
<A>__{george bolts up. the bus cart is still tied to his fat belly.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{uh, i've seen the light! you guys have really turned me around on this! i'm like born again and shit! i swear!}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(to connor)}
<D>__{what do ya think? let him go?}
<A>__{connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it shut. he points it to george's forehead. george weeps in earnest.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{we'll let god decide if you get a second chance.}
<A>__{he slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click."}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{well, praise the lord.}
<A>__{the terrified ex gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling out of his bonds. just as he touches the door.}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{george?}
<P>__{(george turns)}
<D>__{all good boys go to heaven.}
<A>__{george nods and exits. romeo is confused as our trio gathers. connor tosses the bullet he palmed to romeo and he nods.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{now, that was, perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that i have ever had the good fortune ta witness.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{well, thank you very much. mysterious ways. mysterious ways.}
<A>__{slo mo: suddenly, eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels her weapon at the brothers and romeo. romeo levels back. eunice fires as the boys dive on romeo. crew cut is revealed behind our trio, firing from the shadows. eunice and crew cut exchange fire as the boys reload. eunice hits crew cut in the side. the assassin has a moment of outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit. in the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is gone. silence falls. presently, romeo and the boys bolt up. romeo goes for the door and the boys level at eunice.}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{drop the gun! drop it!}
<A>__{she "places" her gun on a nearby table.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{easy fellas. i'm alone.}
<A>__{the boys are before her as romeo returns.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he's gone.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{who are ya?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{my name is eunice bloom...and i'm your new guardian angel. a torch was passed to me by a mutual friend, gone but not forgotten.}

<D>__{very well...connor, murphy.}
<A>__{the boys nod. romeo points to the front door.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{who the fuck was that guy?!}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{that, i suspect, was the shooter you boys have been looking for.}
<A>__{the boys look at each other. frustration. anger.}

<D>__{fucking...what the fuck?! who the fuck is this brawd?! and what the fuck's going on, here?!}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{let's speed this up before your new sidekick's got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary.}

<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{i am an fbi agent who is controlling this investigation from within, in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell. i am conspiring to do this with three like minded individuals who have aided you in the past. though i have yet to inform them of my agenda because, well, girl's gotta have her fun.}

<C>__{connor}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{eunice denotes the bodies.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{this...simply won't do. we made a deal. the big fish step in if your body count gets too high and...}
