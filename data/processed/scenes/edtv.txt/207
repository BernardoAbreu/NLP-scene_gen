<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{it's depressing. there's a liquor bottle on the dresser. ed sees it.}
<C>__{hank }
<D>__{how've you been?}
<A>__{ed shrugs.}
<C>__{hank }
<D>__{they don't get cable here, so 1 can't watch you.}
<A>__{ed just grunts. hank takes laundry off a chair.}
<C>__{hank }
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{he does. he looks around.}
<C>__{hank }
<D>__{quite a shithole, isn't it?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{it could be, if you fixed it up. how did you... ? i mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i was in jail.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the whole time? eighteen years?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{no. two times.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{check forging.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh, man! so...}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{the last two years, i've been a limousine driver, but i don't see well anymore, so...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so you saw me on tv and you said "hey, let me jump on this."}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i need help. how many times if just one little thing that i needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. if i had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.}
<A>__{ed doesn't know what to say. he's bitter towards hank, but there's also some empathy.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{all right... this is my father, i don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him get him a job i'11 ... help you. i'11 ... mention your business or ... i don't know, we'11 figure it out.}
<P>__{(quickly, to hank)}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{ed... i'm sorry.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(still bitter)}
<D>__{yeah? that's good. sorry is good. you know i finished that model.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the pirate ship.}
<A>__{hank looks blankly at him.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{ that we were doing "together." i finished it. it came out great! because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me "that's too much glue. you're using too much glue."}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{do you still have it?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. ray sat on it. i'11 see you.}
<A>__{he exits. out in the hallway, he leans back against the door, drained. the camera is right on him, soaking it up.}
