<A>__{the chink leads sissy into the cave where we see his clockworks. it is made of garbage can lids and old saucepans and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with baling wire. a bat flies into it making a bong noise and the contraption moves a little.}

<D>__{then if you are japanese, then why are you called the chink?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{the clock people mistook me for chinese. and the name stuck. in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled "indians" through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "indians" misnamed me. the clock people, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes. they have lived together since 1906.}
