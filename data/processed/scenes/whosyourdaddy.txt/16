<L>__{interior ted's bedroom night}
<A>__{candles light the dark room. rain pours hard outside. journalism mementos all over ted's walls. news clippings. magazine covers. there's even a faux pulitzer, a christmas gift from his parents. ted's dad sits on the edge of his bed.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i remember spring break of my senior year. seems like a lifetime ago.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{dad, please.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{grandpa was so strong back then. working from the crack of dawn. so proud of his peaches.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{you're way ahead of me again?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(proving it...)}
<D>__{it was the year of the rhizopus rot. grandpa almost lost the farm. you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{the lesson being?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. it's all part of growing up. and it usually works out peachy in the end.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm getting so good at this.}
<A>__{dad chuckles, but ted's still moping.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you guys are my parents.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{of course we are.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{they didn't want me when i was born. why should i care...}
<A>__{...if they're dead.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{son.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, why should i?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{they had a rough life. your father was a bouncer. your mother was, well, a two bit stripper. there was no place for a baby.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{they did do one great thing. they gave us our boy.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{be a sport. how bad could spring break in los angeles be?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i guess we could go to disneyland or something.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{like one of those "national geographic" specials with the topless chicks?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{whatever helps you cope.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{there ya go. always remember, focus on the peach...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{...not the pit.}
<A>__{ted's dad hugs him briefly, laughing...}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{always one step ahead of your dear old dad.}
