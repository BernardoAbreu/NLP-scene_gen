<L>__{exterior n.y. theater street day}
<A>__{margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in. it's friday afternoon no performance.}
<C>__{margo's voice}
<D>__{what was it the wise man said "this, too, will pass away"? two weeks later the day of the audition all was well with bill and me, the world and me }
<L>__{interior lobby and foyer curran theater day}
<A>__{margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer. she spots addison sprawled on one of the sofas.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{why so remote, addison? i should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{miss caswell, at the moment, is where i can lend no support moral or otherwise.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the ladies' shall we say lounge?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{being violently ill to her tummy.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's good luck before an audition. she'll be all right once it starts.}
<A>__{she heads for the auditorium.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{miss caswell got lucky too late. the audition is over.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{over? it can't be. i've come to read with her. i promised max.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{the audition was called for 2:30. it is now nearly four.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{is it really? i must start wearing a watch, i never do, you know... who read with miss caswell? bill?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{lloyd?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{well, it couldn't have been max! who?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{naturally enough, your understudy.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. eve harrington.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{eve! my understudy...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(keenly)}
<D>__{didn't you know?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{of course i knew.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it just slipped your mind.}
<A>__{a moment of silence.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how... how was miss caswell?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{frankly, i don't remember.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{just slipped your mind.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{completely. nor, i am sure, could anyone else present tell you how miss caswell read or whether miss caswell read or rode a pogo stick.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{was she that bad?}
<A>__{as addison speaks, he rises with excitement.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{margo, as you know, i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith. i have no other world, no other life and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. you were one. jeanne eagels another... paula wessely... hayes there are others, three or four. eve harrington will be among them...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{i take it she read well.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it wasn't reading, it was a performance. brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how nice.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{in time she'll be what you are.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a mass of music and fire. that's me. an old kazoo and some sparkles. tell me was bill swept away, too, or were you too full of revelation to notice?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{bill didn't say but lloyd was beside himself. he listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how nice for lloyd. and how nice for eve. how nice for everybody.}
<A>__{addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. he senses the approaching typhoon, he whips it up...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{eve was incredibly modest. she insisted that no credit was due her, that lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the implication being that i have not been reading them as written.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{to the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.}
<A>__{miss caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{feeling better, my dear?}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{like i just swam the english channel. now what?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.}
<A>__{margo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium. addison smiles. he takes miss caswell's arm.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{tell me this. do they have auditions for television?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{that's all television is, my dear. nothing but auditions.}
<A>__{he takes her toward the street.}
