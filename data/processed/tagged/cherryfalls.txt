<L>__{interior car}
<A>__{a teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her breast. he pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her bare knee. as he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently pulls it away. she places it back on her breast, sliding it under her shirt. we pull back. stacy and rod, two healthy sixteen year olds, are passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big american car. rod smiles seductively, kisses stacy, and places his hand back on her knee. once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand tightly.}

<A>__{she hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. she sees the silhouette of someone standing a few feet away. the wind picks up. stacy realizes it isn't rod. all she can see is that whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very long, jagged, steel nail in the other.}

<A>__{jody and kenny try to make it to the door. leonard tries to get up but he can't. he starts crawling toward jody, slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way, sending them to the ground. one kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. blood sprays across the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler. through the sea of legs, leonard sees jody's leg, the 'vir' still freshly carved. he slashes his way towards jody.}
