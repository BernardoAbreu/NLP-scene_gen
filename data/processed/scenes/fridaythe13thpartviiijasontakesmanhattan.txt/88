<L>__{interior bowels of ship on eva}
<A>__{empty for a second, then eva appears, weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways. she races past a sign directing passengers to "club ruby." angle jason entering the same corridor a beat after eva exits it in the direction of the disco. he tramples onward.}
<L>__{interior corridor disco (steadicam)}
<A>__{the thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes eva as she tears open a door, entering the corridor. move backwards with her as she rushes forward, curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech disco floor. a flashing star wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music. she's all alone in here.}
<B>__{tight on eva}
<A>__{the lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror. she spots another door on a small stage, rushing to it. it's locked. crooked angle entrance door as jason enters the corridor, slamming the door shut}
<B>__{behind him. eva}
<A>__{decides this is the wrong place to be. she moves for the corridor again and:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. the spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. now he's gone.}
<B>__{eva}
<A>__{backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. but:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask. she's on a collision course with him.}
<B>__{eva}
<A>__{whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him. camera spins with her in 360 degree arcs, pushing in on her face. eva's point of view spiraling counter clockwise on the dance floor, flashes of jason materializing where she least expects to see him. and getting closer. finally at the point of exhaustion:}
<B>__{eva}
<A>__{stops, looking everywhere. eva's point of view he seems to be gone. she catches her breath...then sensing his presence, she revolves a half turn to face:}
<B>__{the hockey mask}
<A>__{exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly before her. his forearms recoil with lightning speed as he grips her throat... wide shot disco thundering music. frantic lights. and jason and eva at the center of it all. her feet are twenty four inches off the ground, kicking madly as the life is being choked out of her. finally eva's legs go rag doll limp. jason flings her to the ground like a sack of flour. this dance is over.}
