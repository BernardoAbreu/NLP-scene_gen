<A>__{a paramedic, 30's, checks conners out. teddy concludes her cellphone conversation.}
<C>__{teddy}
<P>__{(to conners; re: richards)}
<D>__{he's unconscious, with a nice knot on his forehead, but stable. three officers are watching the room.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{he wakes, they call.}
<P>__{(to the paramedic)}
<D>__{hey quincy, give it a rest, i'm fine.}
<C>__{paramedic}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{quincy was a coroner. you may have a cracked rib. you should go to the hospital.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{i should do a lot of things.}
<A>__{the paramedic gives up, exits. teddy leans down beside conners.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{you sure you're all right?}

<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{girl's name is gina lopez, twenty eight. done some time for possession, has two kids... am i interrupting?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{teddy exits.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{gina claims she doesn't know anything about a bank robbery.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{of course she doesn't. vincent!}
<A>__{vincent trudges out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{have'em put ms. lopez in interrogation one and turn the a c on full. leave her alone and cold. let me know when her nipples can cut glass.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{will do.}
<P>__{(to dekker)}
<D>__{detective... i didn't realize when we first met who you were. i worked with your father. it was only for a brief time when i first got outta the academy, but it was an honor.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{your father was harry dekker?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i wish it could've been for longer.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{vincent exits. conners looks at dekker in a new light. dekker starts away, until...}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(new subject)}
<D>__{that was some fancy riding. you have a bike?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{used to, but i sold it.}
<P>__{(shows his scrape on his arm)}
<D>__{they're dangerous.}
<A>__{marnie rollins, 20's, a csi officer, wears gloves, pokes her head in the room.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{detectives. ready for you.}
<A>__{the bedroom two large suitcases rest open on the bed. marnie prepares a report.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{somebody going on a trip?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{looks like it, don't it?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{marnie, you're looking well.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{heard you were back, conners... and keep dreaming.}
<A>__{marnie gives dekker an amorous glance, which he returns.}
<C>__{marnie}
<P>__{(to dekker)}
<D>__{you, on the other hand... i gotta bike myself. maybe we can go for a ride sometime? or maybe i can just ride you.}
<A>__{conners looks at both of them.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{can we get back to work?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{we got passports, sun tan lotion, bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully hers and this...}
<A>__{she opens a large duffel bag. conners and dekker look inside the bag... it's full of cash! all denominations.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{must be a fifty large there easy. his cut?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{you'd think, right?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{it's not?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{don't put words in my mouth, but... two things jump out here. first, each bank branch has their own money bands. this is not american national's. after a little checking, it belongs to pacific savings of seattle.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{that sounds familiar.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{it should. four months ago, a half million dollars was stolen in an armed robbery there. just a smash n grab job. they caught the guys a day later, recovering about $400,000. those guys have been in lock up since and their trial's still pending. which leads us to point number two. do you smell that?}
<C>__{dekker}
<P>__{(smells the bills; grimaces)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{when evidence is taken in, any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints, so, to mark it, we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{is that new?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{wave of the future. gotta keep up with the times, conners.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{so this money's not from our bank.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{no. this is the money from the pacific savings job and our evidence room.}
<P>__{(smiling; to dekker)}
<D>__{now... for a list of things you can put in my mouth.}
