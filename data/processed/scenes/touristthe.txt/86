<L>__{interior dining area, pearce's "safe house" later}
<A>__{close on the fish now seasoned, grilled and surrounded by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds. frank places a plate before cara who sits with her wine at pearce's oak table. she looks appreciatively at her plate.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{and she left you for a cook?}
<A>__{frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine. cara takes a bite.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{mmmmm! that's decadent.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{with these ingredients, it's not hard.}
<A>__{frank savors a bite of his meal.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you know something? food tastes better after you've been shot at.}
<A>__{cara laughs. she clinks his glass.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i'm glad i decided to come back for you, frank taylor.}
<A>__{they watch one another eat for several moments.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{can i ask you a question.}
<A>__{she sets down her fork. leans back.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{what's it like? being a criminal?}
<C>__{cara}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{i'm not a criminal.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers... i hate to break it to you, but }
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{okay, i'm a criminal.}
<A>__{she takes a big gulp of wine. moves over to the sofa.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{i didn't mean for things to turn out like this. i always lived by a certain code. but then... i broke it.}
<A>__{she lapses into silence. frank comes and sits beside her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{for alexander pearce?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. which is an answer.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{what's he like?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{he's the most interesting man i've ever known. when i first met him, i wasn't expecting that. he took me by surprise.}
<A>__{she shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if reliving a memory of sensual pleasure.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{if i'd been prepared, i might not have loved him. but i wasn't. so i did.}
<A>__{she frowns into her empty wine glass. frank slides a little closer.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i don't regret it, you know.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{regret what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{kissing you.}
<A>__{he looks into her eyes. they are sitting very close on the sofa. the lights are low. the mood is romantic... frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a kiss cara stands abruptly.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{he looks up at her, questioningly.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought...}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{you thought what? that i saw you on the train and my heart stopped? that all my life i've been waiting for a math teacher from the midwest to sweep me off my feet?}
<A>__{frank doesn't respond.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{i picked you because of your height. do you understand?}
<A>__{he does. his humiliation complete, he rises with as much dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the kitchen. cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt. she is about to say something when... her cell phone rings. a special ring. she answers right away.}
