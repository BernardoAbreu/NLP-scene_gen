<L>__{interior billy's room night}
<A>__{ted's pov billy lies sprawled across the bed, all tangled up in the covers.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{as he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten the covers.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{daddy?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(all anger gone)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{that's okay, pal. go back to sleep. it's very late.}
<A>__{he starts to get up, when:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{daddy?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{uh huh?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(very quiet)}
<D>__{are you... gonna go... away?}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{stunned at the question.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{of course i'm not going away. i love you very much. i will be right here.}
<A>__{there is a beat of silence, then:}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(it comes pouring out)}
<D>__{that's why mommy left... isn't it? 'cause i was bad...}
<A>__{the boy begins to weep.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(he puts his arm around}
<D>__{billy and holds him}
<P>__{close)}
<D>__{oh, christ... oh, christ...}
<P>__{(he thinks for a moment, then:)}
<D>__{no, pal. your mom loves you very much. the reason she left didn't have anything to do with you.}
<P>__{(pause, this is very painful)}
<D>__{look, i don't know if this will make any sense to you, okay? but i will try and explain. you see the reason your mom left was because... well, i guess it was because i kept trying to make her into a certain kind of person... make her be the way i thought a wife was supposed to be. only she wasn't like that. she was...}
<P>__{(smiles to himself)}
<D>__{well, she wasn't like that. and now, when i think about it, i can see she tried very hard to be like i wanted very hard. and when she couldn't, then she tried to tell me about it. only i wouldn't listen. i guess i thought that if i was happy, that meant she was happy too. only she wasn't. the truth is, the only reason she didn't leave a lot sooner was because she loves you so much. joanna stayed until she couldn't stand me any longer and then she left... but it wasn't you, pal. it wasn't you.}
<A>__{there is a long beat of silence as billy thinks about this. clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from his shoulders. finally:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{is mom ever coming back?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mean for good?}
<A>__{billy nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{ted gets to his feet, starts for the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now go to sleep. it's very late.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sleep tight.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{don't let the bedbugs bite.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{see you in the morning light.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{ted pauses in the doorway, smiles.}
