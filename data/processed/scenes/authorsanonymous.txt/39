<A>__{hannah and henry sit together in the reception area. alan breezes in, ever smiling, greeting both enthusiastically.}
<L>__{interior alan's office day}
<A>__{rows of eye glasses on display as alan guides hannah over to the fitting table. henry tags along.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{thanks for seeing me today, alan.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no problemo. let's get you some new eye wear.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{something that makes me look smart.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you're already smart, hannah.}
<A>__{hannah gives henry's hand a playful squeeze: thank you. alan and hannah sit down opposite from each other. henry pulls up a chair to the side. alan selects a pair. puts them on hannah.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{how about...}
<A>__{hannah shrugs her blase reaction.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{mmmmmmm.}
<A>__{alan removes the brown colored frames. studies them for a second. then inspiration arrives.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{excuse me. one sec.}
<A>__{he reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder. speaks into it.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{ah. name for character. alexander brown. wears brown colored glasses.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{of course he would.}
<A>__{henry nods, agreeing. satisfied, alan puts the recorder away and reaches for another pair of glasses.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning. it's called unleashed.}
<A>__{alan tries the second pair on hannah. she checks herself in the mirror. then she shows henry. they both shake their head: no. it is a funny moment between friends. they laugh as alan reaches for pair #3.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{it's about a dog who becomes human for 24 hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner. i love this idea, hannah.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{could be a winner.}
<A>__{alan puts the third pair of glasses on hannah. she checks herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. she looks over towards henry.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{poor henry. she does look good. he's falling even harder for her by the moment.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you look great, hannah.}
<A>__{hannah can't decide. she studies herself in the mirror as henry studies her. henry reaches for his android and snaps a photo of her. alan brings them back to real time.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{question: you think your agent might be interested in this idea? does he have a dog?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(evading)}
<D>__{oh. i don't know }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{how about a cat? it could be a cat.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{um. sure. probably could be.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{think about mentioning it to your agent, ok? unleashed. dog or cat becomes human.}
<A>__{alan beams with pride at his imagination on display. hannah fidgets. avoids alan. henry jumps in to save the moment.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i will help you develop the idea, alan.}
<A>__{alan looks pleased. hannah looks grateful.}
