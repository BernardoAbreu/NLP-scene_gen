<A>__{gina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a hallway. the elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she turns to see: freddy. a razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons. he smiles politely.}

<D>__{going up?}
<A>__{gina is shocked and speechless. she backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil. which is exactly what she is. rising past the terror is gina's realization that everything jacob's been saying is true.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{at your service.}
<A>__{he punches one of the buttons and the elevator lurches. gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and freddy actually begins to whistle nonchalantly.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{you're not real!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{ah, but who is?}
<A>__{the elevator begins to slow.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{fourth floor. overpopulation.}
<A>__{the elevator stops. the doors begin to open. gina leaps for the way out. but she's blocked. blocked by people. they fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in. all kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, plumbers. and they're all zombies. vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in. pushing gina back into the elevator. filling it to capacity and beyond. the doors close and the elevator starts to move up. twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their mouths, breathing down her neck. smashing her so hard she can't even yell for help. gina turns her head. wesley is pressed up next to her. a very dead look on his face. begin squeezed by the zombies around him. one of his eyes pops out of its socket. gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{eight floor the morgue.}
<A>__{the elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out. gina, having only been held up by the crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift. she breathes in ripping gasps like she's having a coronary. but she sees the open door. and gina jumps for the exit. freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently. gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut. freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one. this button doesn't looks like the others. it's in the shape of a little heart. freddy turns and gives gina a frighteningly serious look.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{time to go down, gina.}
<A>__{he presses the heart button. and the floor disappears. gina falls screaming into blackness as freddy hangs in mid air and}
