<A>__{suddenly, she begins to choke on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair. denver and sethe rush towards her. beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin. she breathes in sethe's arms as denver wipes up the mess, glaring at paul.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{beloved}

<A>__{sethe gets beloved to her feet. denver takes her up the staircase to her room glaring at paul. when the girls have gone, sethe turns on paul as she cleans up.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't understand what the hold is. it's clear why she holds onto you, but i just can't see why you holding on to her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{what you care who's holding on to who? feeding her is no trouble. and she's nice company for denver.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we was just starting to feel a little like a family ourselves.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{is that what's got your teeth on edge?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't place it. it's a feeling in me.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you wanna feel somethin!? ... feel how it is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody there not worrying you to death about what you got to do each day to deserve it. and if that don't get it, feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything god made liable to jump on you. feel that!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know every bit of that, sethe. i wasn't born yesterday and i never mistreated a woman in my life!}
<C>__{sethe}

<D>__{what halle ever do to you? halle stood by you. he never left you.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{ha, what'd he leave then if not me, huh?}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he couldn't get out of the loft, i expect.}
<A>__{forgetting himself, paul let that slip out.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{loft? what loft?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{the one over your head... the one in the barn.}
<A>__{sethe stops dead cold. it's no use... the memory takes over:}
