<L>__{exterior down house. the present. day.}
<A>__{darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up against the cold. looking frail still, but oddly at peace.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{ah, there you are mr darwin.}
<A>__{darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky, dark suited figure of mr innes.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{may i join you.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{by odd means}
<A>__{he makes some space on the bench. innes hesitates, unable to read darwin's feelings towards him. the smile is welcoming enough but there is something not altogether balanced about it}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{mrs darwin informed me you would be alone and ....perhaps a need to counsel.}
<A>__{he sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve it.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{you dropped this. what a beautiful postage stamp.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{yes. it is from the spice islands.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{i do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents. in my youth i always wanted to travel.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you are still young. you could be a missionary and follow in mr livingstone's footsteps.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{yes, although i have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad.}
<P>__{(then, casually)}
<D>__{mrs darwin told me of the book you are writing.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{not any more, thank goodness}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{you have finished it?}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{it has been finished for me. my correspondent in the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages.}
<C>__{darwin }
<D>__{there's brevity for you. i had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end. so finally i am rid of the project.}
<A>__{innes is relieved to hear it}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{the lord moves in mysterious ways.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{he does indeed mr innes. i was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa.}
<A>__{innes shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{and then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{well. it is not for us to guess at his reasons.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no. we can leave that for mr wallace now. should i advise him to stay overseas do you think? if he shows his face in kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt.}
<A>__{innes rises. he's a short man, acutely aware of any threats to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{i once valued our friendship mr darwin. i had hoped it might be possible to restore it. clearly in your present mood that is not going to be possible. my regards to mrs darwin}
<A>__{he starts off round the corner of the house. darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his face back to the sun. when he opens his eyes sees a figure standing in the lawn. it is annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{what? i am forestalled by mr wallace. that is the simple fact of it. what reason do you have to be angry?!}
<A>__{she shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him and runs off towards the meadow. darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries after her.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{annie!}
<A>__{he reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and fells him to his knees. he lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of the wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to the wind. a view from high above: spiralling downwards on the darwin garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters and hurry to his assistance.}
