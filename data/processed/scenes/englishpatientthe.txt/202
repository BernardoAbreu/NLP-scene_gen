<A>__{almasy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes against the sun. the plane bounces along the runway, not quite landing. almasy continues packing the equipment. almasy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly heading straight towards him. he's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run. he dives at the ground. the plane smashes against an invisible ridge and turns over and over, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the prostrate almasy. he gets to his feet and starts to run towards the wreckage. a blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire. almasy pulls away the debris to find geoffrey slumped, neck broken, bloody. he tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his absolute horror, katharine, staring grimly ahead, unable to move. he's frantic.}

<D>__{why did he bring you?}

<D>__{a surprise, he said.}

<D>__{poor geoffrey. he knew. he must have known all the time. he was shouting i love you, katharine, i love you so much. is he badly hurt? his neck is odd.}
<A>__{almasy puts his arm around katharine to try and pull her clear. she can't stand the pain.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{please don't move me. it hurts too much.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{we've got to get you out of here.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{it hurts too much.}

<P>__{(can't bear to hurt her)}
<D>__{i know, darling, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{the smoke thickens. he pulls hard the pain from which causes katharine to gasp, then pass out. they slip haphazardly to the ground, cushioned a little by the sand. he lifts her gently into his arms and carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back. the plane suddenly erupts in flames. almasy dashes into the fire, disappearing into the smoke before emerging with clifton over his shoulder, fireman's lift style.}
