<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{noisy, trendy downtown bar. professional type on a bar stool. thirties. handsome. doug. he laughs when he sees emily.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i am so in your head.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss. sits down beside him.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{be honest. the whole psychology thing, it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{regrettably, yes.}
<A>__{they share a laugh. he gestures to the bartender for another beer.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you know what freaks me out?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{that you have a four year degree and make seventeen grand a year after taxes?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i sit there talking to these families, you know, like i'm some expert. my family's a train wreck. i mean, i had this moment today where i realized i might be totally full of it.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{everybody's full of it. in the end you're a number to call for people who don't have anyone else. there's no way that's bad.}
<A>__{emily nods, appreciates that. recognizes a girl going by in the crowd. a friend from school. well dressed. career oriented. the track emily might be on if she weren't a social worker.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{hey becca...}
<C>__{friend}
<P>__{(hugging her)}
<D>__{hey. so one of us is a major screwup, i can't remember if i was supposed to call you or the other way around...?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no, it's me, it's just been a crazy couple weeks. you remember doug.}
<C>__{friend}
<P>__{(handshake)}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(then to emily)}
<D>__{listen, my ride's leaving, let's catch up soon, okay?}
<A>__{emily nods okay. the girl departs. emily's beer arrives. doug hands it to her.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so anyway, i've done some soul searching and i just want to say that if a full on relationship feels like too much right now, i'd be willing to consider a purely physical one.}
<A>__{emily, sipping her beer, smiles.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, you might actually enjoy yourself.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm sure i would, i just...}
<A>__{hard to explain. doug saves her the trouble.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i know, i know, the job, you get home you don't have anything left.}
<A>__{emily nods yeah, leans in closer, the friendly banter giving way to a moment of real sincerity.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{if it were anyone, it'd be you.}
<A>__{they exchange a look then doug clinks his glass against hers. and as they drink together after a long day, more than friends, less than lovers...}
