<A>__{nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record toselli's "serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted europe at the close of the great war. as the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. then she turns and sidles over to sit next to cary who is seated by the window, scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what are you writing, cary?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{a letter. a letter to shep's mother.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{mind if i read it?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{certainly not.}
<A>__{nikki reads the letter silently. a long pause.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{why, cary. cary, that's the most beautiful letter i've ever read.}
<A>__{nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{please forgive me for crying, cary. i can't help it. you don't mind if i cry just a minute, do you?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no, nikki.}
<A>__{cary puts aside the letter.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{can't you cry, cary?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{long, long time ago. before the war.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and you can't cry now? not even for shep?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep lambert spent his life in the war. he had nothing more to give. he had died once. and he was ready to die again.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{this time he was played out with music. that was the way he wanted it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{and bill talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts. maybe he'll tackle the angel gabriel and be a big success again.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and francis?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{maybe francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping. till the end. it doesn't matter now. without them, nothing matters. we only had each other. comradeship was all we had left. and now that's gone, too.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and you, cary? you? you're alone now.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right. i'm alone now.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't want you to be alone, cary. let me stay with you. let me be with you.}
<A>__{he takes her hand, looks at her affectionately.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why, nikki. you're sweet.}
<A>__{he kisses her hand. a strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it to reveal a heart shaped stone. cary looks at her in surprise.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why, nikki, you kept it. you didn't forget.}
<A>__{she lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no harm can come to our true love.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(amused, skeptical)}
<D>__{no harm can come to our true love?}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{oh, nikki, you've become very dear to me. i want to help you. can't i do something for you, too? what do you want? what can i get you?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, i've always wanted a pair of spanish earrings.}
<A>__{he gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she buries her head lovingly in his shoulder. he kisses her hand again.}
