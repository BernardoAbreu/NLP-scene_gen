<A>__{roy has been throwing up but is finished now. he's sprawled like a shot deer across the hood of his honda, still clutching his stomach. a police car stops, the passenger cop gets out. he's suspicious at first.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{sir? everything all right?}
<A>__{the sight of the uniform forces roy into gear. he straightens, smiling through his pain.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{getting better. a bad shrimp, i think.}
<A>__{the con's suspicion changes to concern.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{want us to take you to a doctor?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no no, i'm fine now, thanks, anyway. still got a lot of clients to see.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{take it easy, now.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, i will.}
