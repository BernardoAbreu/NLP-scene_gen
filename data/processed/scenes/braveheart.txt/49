<A>__{we favor wallace's subjective pov: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear... they stand to shoot at him with their bows; the arrows whish toward the lens, fly past... the arrows tear through wallace's clothes, but don't catch his flesh. he charges on; his horse leaps the barrier as wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword and he's more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head! the soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his horse leaps over them. one of them has sighted william's back... but hamish and his father crash into them! it's a wild fight; old campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder but keeps hacking with his sword; hamish batters down two men and more scots arrive! they overwhelm the soldiers. wallace races through the village favoring his pov he dodges obstacles in the narrow streets chickens, carts, barrels. soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next chops down on his left side; every time he swings the broadsword, a man dies. wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from the village, follow in his wake.}
