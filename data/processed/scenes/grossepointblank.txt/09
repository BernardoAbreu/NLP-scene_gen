<A>__{martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the scope in the other. next to him, the assembled rifle rests across the arm of a chair.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...i don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me.}
<A>__{he glances over to a second window to his left, which offers a view further down the street. he goes to it. he raises the scope and sees martin's p.o.v. scope window #2 a few blocks down, small even through the high powered scope, is your average bicycle messenger dressed in lycra racing gear, weaving through traffic toward us. slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag. the messenger's hand is hidden in it. the other phone begins to ring.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hold on a second, tom. i got my hands full here.}
<A>__{he sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching the messenger.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{good. account number 3649367, transfer to account number 96 546 38739 47825. ask for mr. sanchez, tell him it's mr. duckman. if there are any problems, access file 673594638 io 98, and look at it.}
<A>__{martin drops the phone and moves away from window #2 to the rifle. he mounts the scope and he looks out window #1 at the high rise. martin's p.o.v. scope window #1 of a doorman opening the door for a group of five men in suits. four bodyguards form a perimeter around the fifth man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in saville row finery.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises the rifle toward window #2. martin's p.o.v. scope window #2 of an empty street. the bicycle messenger flashes past.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{concentrating, tracks the path of the messenger, leading him left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall between window #2 and window #1.}
<B>__{street}
<A>__{the bicycle messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing a mac 10 submachine gun from his bag. the group see him just as martin's sniper fire explodes the messenger's chest. two of the bodyguards collapse onto their boss. the other two open fire on the messenger as he wipes out horribly into a parked car in front of them.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and begins to break down the rifle.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{sorry tom. but look, i know it's the playoffs. that's why i'm offering a thousand dollars for one seat...}
<A>__{martin listens patiently as he works.}
