<L>__{interior sasha's room night}
<A>__{playing with his toys, adam does not see archer's icy gaze.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{how old is he?}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{five. no one knows you're his father. i thought someone might want to hurt him just to hurt you...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{bang! bang! bang!}
<A>__{startled, they turn to see adam pointing a toy gun at them. upset, she takes it from his hands.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{you know mommy doesn't like you playing with these things...}
<A>__{she kicks the toy aside and lifts adam offering him to archer. awkwardly, archer takes the boy. archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{you're not holding him right... caz...}
<A>__{archer isn't hearing sasha. he's lost in his own memory... the sound of a carousel... a kid's laughter... a gunshot... then adam smiles perhaps the way matthew once smiled. it pulls something up from inside archer something strong. he regains control, dumping the child into sasha's arms.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{he's not my son.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{yes, he is !}
<A>__{then something alerts archer maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window light for the barest second.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{k boom boom boom boom! the window panes shatter as teargas grenades and gunfire riddles the loft.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{across the way, castor directs the firepower.}
