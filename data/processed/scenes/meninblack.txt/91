<A>__{the orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. from inside, throaty wails of frustration can be heard. two passersby hear the racket and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved. but an inhuman growl rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on their way.}

<A>__{inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against edgar's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship, edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the rest of the box and smacks it with his right fist. nothing doing. he bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally cracks a hinge. edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box. inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. but the rest of the box is empty.}
