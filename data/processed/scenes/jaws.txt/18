<L>__{exterior avril bay day}
<A>__{a flotilla of twenty exhausted boy scouts round a buoy that marks the official course. a rowboat with scoutmaster using a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.}
<C>__{scoutmaster}
<P>__{(bullhorn effect)}
<D>__{let's go, robbie. you too, hofner. boyle, keep your head up. alberts, keep kicking...}
<P>__{(etc., ad lib)}
<L>__{exterior on the beach at avril bay day}
<A>__{two older seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, while some parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching their offspring. brody pulls up in the amity police jeep, and starts toward the people. behind him, vaughn's cadillac pulls up and skids to a stop. in it are vaughn, meadows, the doctor, maybe a selectman, and hendricks, with his arms still full of sign material. vaughn intercepts brody, the others circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through the sand to the scouts.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{martin!}
<P>__{(he catches up with him)}
<D>__{are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{do i need any more authority?}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(the good guy)}
<D>__{that's just going by the book. we're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. this is your first summer.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{now tell me something i don't know.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{all i'm saying is that amity is a summer town we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at cape cod, or long island.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{so we should set out a smorgasbord?}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{we're not even sure what it was.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what else could've done that?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(to doctor)}
<D>__{boat propeller?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i think, possibly... sure. a boating accident.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along }
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{remember when fred ganz went scalloping in his bvd's? he was going to swim to new bedford, he said.}
<A>__{the men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this foolishness.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{...and bill mayhew almost caught him in his net...?}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(interrupting the merriment)}
<D>__{doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i was wrong. we'll have to amend the report.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{we never had that kind of trouble here.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i was only reacting to what i was told.}
<A>__{brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding another buoy on the home stretch.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(taking brody aside)}
<D>__{it's all psychological, anyway. you yell 'barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'. you yell 'shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. i think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of july.}
<A>__{vaughn indicates the beach where the scouts are flopping out onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i can't work in a vacuum. why don't you make hendricks chief? his family's been here since the puritans half this island are his cousins.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{martin, we hired the best man we could find.}
<A>__{all ad lib agreement.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{we need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{you have our complete support.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{now then. we've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about...}
<A>__{the others surround brody as vaughn leads the way back to the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate choppers. hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of vaughn's cadillac. vaughn waves casually to the scouts and swimmers who are vigorously toweling off in the background.}
