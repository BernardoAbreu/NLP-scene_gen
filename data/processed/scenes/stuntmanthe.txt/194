<L>__{interior hotel corridor on elevator doors night}
<A>__{it's three o'clock in the morning. the corridors are empty as the elevator door swings open and nina and eli step out and move down the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{sorry i had to put you through that. i know it was humiliating.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...it was awful...i hated it. but you did save that man's life.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah, that was really nice of me. i'm a nice person. i just wish i had the strength to go to his room and break his spine. on the last day of filming the queen decides to come out of the closet! wouldn't that have made a lovely headline? you understand, of course, that the film would've been destroyed. doing that to me...}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{eli, what's wrong?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{nothing serious. just a little self indulgence. feel sorry for eli time.}
<A>__{eli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{i'm sorry, but you know...it's too goddamn much. why's everybody on my back? when's somebody gonna say, "there, there eli?" i'm really surrounded by friends, allies and you..."what else can i do for your film, eli?"}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(wounded)}
<D>__{that's not fair.}
<A>__{they have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his separate way. they stop.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what's not fair...getting my feelings "hurt?" when did i lose you to that soldier boy, nina? that nice, wholesome, swell looking kid...wanted by every cop, the fbi and god knows who else, for god knows what crime.}
<A>__{nina is paralyzed with shock.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{come on, nina, those blue eyes have bedazzled our little girl. for christ's sake, he reeks of blood.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{you sound as crazy as...}
<P>__{(she stops)}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{as who?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{he thinks you're trying to...}
<P>__{(she can't say 'kill')}
<D>__{...harm him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{any number of people are trying to harm him...}
<A>__{he walks off down the corridor.}
