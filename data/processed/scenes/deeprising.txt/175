<A>__{they enter the rear ballast section, where the walls are indeed far apart, half of which is now a small pond. obviously flooded. the only way out of this room is down some steps which vanish beneath the seawater, or through a single violently twisted hatch door. finnegan tries to push the hatch. it will not give. mamooli and chin join him, adding their considerable muscle to the task. the hatch holds tight. finnegan turns to canton, who stands slumped against a railing. he does not look well at all.}
