The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN. There are several people at the counter with him, including GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them. A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. This is WADE.}

<DIAL>__{I'm good, though. There ain't but one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. I've been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's just wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. And breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this song.}
<ACTION>__{She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished his meal.}
