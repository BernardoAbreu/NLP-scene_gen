<A>__{move across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable. the camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still. we read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly:}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{valkyrie.}
<L>__{interior smoky room night}
<A>__{stauffenberg faces the top members of the resistance.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{we've already considered valkyrie. it isn't suitable.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{not as it's currently written.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{excuse me. what is valkyrie?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{operation valkyrie.}
<A>__{tresckow explains even as he studies stauffenberg, curious. what does he have in mind?}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{the reserve army has thousands of men all over the city most of them not even in uniform. valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{and what use is that to us?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{the orders could be rewritten. a few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{yes, of course, but }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{now what would the high command do if they thought, say, the ss was staging a coup?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{they would declare a military state of emergency.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{and initiate operation valkyrie.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{hitler's own reserve army, using hitler's own plan and under our command, would automatically seize power in berlin...}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<P>__{(catching on)}
<D>__{while we put a new government in place.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{precisely. it will seem as though we're fighting for hitler government, not against it.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{but only if hitler's dead.}
<A>__{all eyes turn to goerdeler. here we go.}
<C>__{goerdeler }
<D>__{that is what you're saying, isn't it? the central solution.}
<C>__{goerdeler }
<D>__{how else will you make people believe the ss is trying to seize power?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm afraid it's the only way.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{i'm disappointed in you, colonel. i thought a man of your background would appreciate a more }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{yes, but }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{and you're neither, doctor. now if you want to be chancellor, you'll do as you're told.}
<A>__{a moment of tension. humiliated, goerdeler nods. but he won't ever forget this...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to tresckow)}
<D>__{can this plan be made to work?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{rewriting the order is one thing distributing it is another. a bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails. in this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{it's the best idea we've heard yet.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{there is one... small problem.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{fromm...}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{who is fromm?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{commander of the home army. olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only fromm can actually initiate valkyrie.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{can we get to him?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{he's a careerist pig.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{but one who's gone as high as he can go in hitler's army. it's no secret he's not happy about it.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we don't seem to have a choice. without fromm there is no valkyrie.}
<P>__{(to olbricht and stauffenberg)}
<D>__{get him.}
<A>__{we end on goerdeler, a look of concern on his face.}
