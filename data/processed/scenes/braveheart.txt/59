<L>__{exterior woods by the stream night}
<A>__{hamish is waiting as william comes out of the grove. there is nothing to say. they mount their horses and ride away, as the music of william and marion's love haunts us...}
<L>__{exterior woods encampment night}
<A>__{wallace and his inner circle hare huddled around a small fire. other highlanders guard the perimeters. old campbell is lovingly honing the broadswords to razor edges and sharing a whiskey jug with hamish, who stares at the fire. wallace is using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{what're ya doin'?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{thinking.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{what do we do when longshanks sends his whole northern army against us? they have heavy cavalry. armored horses, that shake the very ground. they'll ride right over us.}
<A>__{at a loss, wallace looks up at the sky. he sees: the trees stretching into the night like spikes to skewer the stars.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{we make spears. a hundred spears. fourteen feet long.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{fourteen? }
<C>__{sentry }
<D>__{volunteers coming in!}
<A>__{they look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in, blindfolded. when the guides remove the blindfolds, the new recruits see wallace and rush to him, bowing.}
<C>__{recruit }
<D>__{william wallace? we have come to fight and die for you!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{stand up, man, i'm not the pope.}
<C>__{faudron}
<D>__{i am faudron! my sword is yours! and i brought you this tarta }
<A>__{as he reaches into his cloak, both hamish and campbell instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck.}
<C>__{sentry}
<D>__{we checked them for arms.}
<A>__{carefully, faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and replaces wallace's tattered old one.}
<C>__{faudron}
<D>__{it's your family tartan! my wife wove it with her own hands.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{thank her for me.}
<A>__{a loud voice interrupts...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{him? that can't be william wallace! i'm prettier than this man!}
<A>__{they all look at a slender, handsome young man, stephen, who is talking to himself or more accurately, seems to listen to some unheard voice, then answer it...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{all right, father, i will ask him!}
<P>__{(to william)}
<D>__{if i risk my neck for you, will i get a chance to kill englishmen?}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{is your poppa a ghost or do you converse with god almighty?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{in order to find his equal, and irishman is forced to talk to god.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{yes, father!...}
<P>__{(to wallace)}
<D>__{the almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{insane irish }
<A>__{stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at campbell's throat.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man.}
<A>__{wallace jerks his sword to the irishman's throat, and grins.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{that's my friend, irishman. and the answer's yes. you fight for me, you kill the english.}
<A>__{stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{excellent! stephen is my name. i'm the most wanted man on the emerald isle. except i'm not on the emerald isle of course, more's the pity.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{a common thief.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{a patriot!}
<A>__{wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.}
