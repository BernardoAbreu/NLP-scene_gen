<C>__{cameron's voice}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{what am i worried about the cops for?}
<C>__{eli's voice}
<D>__{another one over there.}
<L>__{81b the view whips to a second police roadblock at the other entrance to}

<P>__{(puts viewer down)}
<D>__{is this my present?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no, your present is a piece of good advice.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{keep it.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(patting sam's beach bag)}
<D>__{you've got that look again. that gleam of the sprinter about to set a record for the 50 yard dash. is that why all those cops are chasing you? what are you, some kind of sex freak running across america with your fly open? is that why they're after you?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you're close. what's your advice?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{button your fly and be at the airport on sunday at three o'clock with the rest of the crew. climb aboard our chartered 707 and fly away with us to where the setting sun bleeds into a million swimming pools a man can hide in. you do swim as well as run?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(overwhelmed by the offer)}
<D>__{i will swim like a fish. you really mean it?}
<P>__{(eli nods)}
<D>__{why are you trying to save my ass?}
<A>__{eli hesitates, then answers quietly for him there is great meaning in it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{...because you're as crazy as the guy i'm doing the picture about.}
<P>__{(then grinning archly, the mood broken)}
<D>__{...besides, i've fallen madly in love with the dark side of your nature.}
