<L>__{interior mackelway's apartment entry continuing}
<A>__{the door bursts open. the greasy bag and the soda fall to the floor. mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. he dials hurriedly.}
<L>__{intercut with:}
<A>__{ interior fran's car same we're in a parking lot outside a wal mart. fran's just thrown a bag into her ford taurus. her cel phone rings. she grabs it.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{kulok.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{he really was fbi.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{o'ryan. he left his file on my doorstep. fran, he was fbi.}
<A>__{he can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what was in that file now; pages are splayed across mackelway's coffee table: a copy of an fbi i.d. badge, xeroxed memoes, test scores, citations, evaluations, reports. the entire career of special agent benjamin o'ryan... in black and white.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm look at his whole history! citations, letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from quantico. the guy was an agent.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{listen to me }
<A>__{then we hear a beep. call waiting. great.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{shit! hold on.}
<A>__{that irritated her. mackelway clicks over.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{read anything interesting lately?}
<A>__{mackelway's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{where are you?}
<A>__{click. o'ryan's just hung up.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re connecting to fran.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{that was him.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{he called you at home?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{beep. call waiting again.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{jesus. call me back.}
<A>__{mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{o'ryan?}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{i've found him, you know.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{zero.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{zero's a myth. you made him up.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{myths don't kidnap little boys. do they?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{do you?}
<A>__{sounds like o'ryan just laughed... then, another curve:}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{was she pretty?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{i could hear her moaning, right under the navajo chanting. whole thing was downright tribal. what's she look like?}
<A>__{that was unsettling. very. mackelway looks around feeling violated, feeling "watched." he draws the blinds. double bolts the front door. runs his hand under the window frame for any kind of wire tapping. but mackelway won't allow himself to over react. not now, with o'ryan on the phone.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{you tell me.}
<A>__{o'ryan laughs. he liked that.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{fair enough. we'll stick to business: how'd ya like my old room?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{"hope house." you were there.}
<A>__{how the hell did he know that? it's unsettling.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{dyson re paint it?}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{my room. did he re paint it?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{yeah. white.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{...but you saw what was underneath, of course.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{no. tell me about it.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{no. you tell me.}
<A>__{click. o'ryan just hung up. mackelway stares at the phone.}
