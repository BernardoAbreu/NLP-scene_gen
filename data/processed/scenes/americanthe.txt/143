<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{slam! jack shuts the boot of the car. he scans the lakeside. no sign of the picnic. no sign of clara.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{everything i've ever done...}
<A>__{then he spots something. on the ground, not far from the car. he walks over and picks it up. it's one of clara's shoes.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i've done for a reason.}
<A>__{jack is staring at the shoe.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i never thought the day would come when i'd run out of reasons. reasons to worry. reasons to run. reasons to pull the trigger.}
<A>__{jack turns and walks over to the car. clara is in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{maybe that day's come.}
<A>__{jack gets into the citroen.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{or maybe i've just found a reason to change.}
<A>__{and hands clara her shoe.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{grazie, eduardo.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i still don't understand. what's the point of a gun if it's not loaded?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{one of the girls borrow it to me after the second hooker in chieti is murdered. with some of the clients it make me feel safe. i don't tell the police, of course, but... madonna, eduardo. how they do to these two women! a police agente from rome show me photographs. they show photographs to everyone in via lampedusa.}
<A>__{clara shivers with disgust.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{non capito... how one person hurt another in this way.}
<A>__{jack looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{does the gun make you feel safer with me?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you are not a client.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then why's it in your purse?}
<A>__{clara looks unhappy.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i have to work tonight, amore.}
<A>__{silence. jack looks away.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{maybe this is suicide. cops often put the graft on working girls. perhaps the girl i told you about, clara, has sold me out. jack (v.o.) (cont'd) maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe she's a hired gun. then again, maybe clara is who she says she is and my belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money. always a risk in my profession. or perhaps my trusted colleague in rome no longer trusts me. perhaps even you, father, with your connections in naples...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{what will you do?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i guess i will go to work too.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{and after that? tomorrow and the next day.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can't stay here forever.}
<A>__{as the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he could.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{it's not that i've given up on life, father. just the way that i was living it. if you can call it living.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i want always to stay here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's time to go home.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{let me come to your home.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can't, clara. one day...}
<A>__{she's upset but decides not to press her demand.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{if i had one request, father, it would be this. that it's not clara who finally pulls the trigger. but whoever it is...}
<A>__{clara kisses him and simply says:}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{stay forever here.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{...by this time tomorrow i will be dead.}
<A>__{fade to black.}
