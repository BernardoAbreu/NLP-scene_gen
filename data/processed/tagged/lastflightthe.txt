<A>__{on a freeze frame of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. the distant roar of battle rumbles ominously. superimposed titles appear and hold for a moment. abruptly, the image springs to life. the gun fires deafeningly. the nearby branches shake violently. another set of titles appears. the image freezes again as a lone bugle plays a charge. again and again and again, the image moves, the gun discharges noisily, the image freezes and more sets of titles appear with every firing. on the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:}
<B>__{war montage}
<A>__{nothing but fast, brutal flash cuts of: cannon firing in all directions. massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. an entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. men yelling. faster and faster, more and more chaotic: mortar fire, explosions, smoke. a machine gunner fires. a soldier falls. infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. more machine gunning. more soldiers go down. a massive gun fires.}

<A>__{around her neck, on a slender chain, nikki carries a small lorgnette. it opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. she uses it frequently, peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. on shep's remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. he raises his drink to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(off frink)}
<D>__{pay no attention. sometimes he goes away.}
<A>__{nikki looks away glumly as shep grins at her. she turns and sees something. she raises her lorgnette for a better look at:}

<D>__{oh, i'm so sorry. your hands...}
<A>__{she tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, your poor hands! your poor, poor hands.}
<A>__{wildly uncomfortable, cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. stunned, nikki watches him exit the building. she realizes she's done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{but shep intercepts her. upset, she whimpers.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(more in disbelief than anger)}
<D>__{if you aren't the worst! first, you insult his hands and make him mad. then you cry over them and make him self conscious. come on back here. come on.}
<A>__{he clasps her hand and leads her to:}
<B>__{the bar}
<A>__{francis and bill watch, disturbed, as shep guides a crying nikki onto a stool beside them. shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. she pulls out a compact to fix her tear stained face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, that's torn it. he'll never come back now.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{then we'll have to find him.}

<D>__{to explain how sorry i am.}

<D>__{you are. you're coming all apart.}
<P>__{(hands her a glass)}

<C>__{shep}
<D>__{oh, out.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(rises)}

<D>__{out to get a drink.}

<D>__{nope. we gotta go somewheres else.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{shep }
<D>__{cary!}
<A>__{cary looks up. he rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. the others crowd around him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(genuinely polite)}
<D>__{hello. won't you sit down?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sure we'll sit down. what'd ya think we'd do? stand around?}
<A>__{they all take seats around the little table. during this, frink brings a chair for nikki who grabs a seat of her own. when he tries to use it to sit next to her, bill commandeers it for himself.}

<P>__{(with a wave, to frink)}
<D>__{thank you.}

<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{champagne? oui.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{boys, she's goin' to be a problem.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(explains, to bill)}
<D>__{that's what i started on.}
<P>__{(to cary)}
<D>__{it upsets me if i change over to anything else.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{there's a lot of things wrong with this one.}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{what were you doing at the bar at claridge's anyway?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{yes. don't you know you're not supposed to be there?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{there's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{can't read signs.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{do you think she's good lookin' enough?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, i know i'm not very good looking but }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but when i was a little girl, my mother always said i had the nicest hair ribbon.}
<A>__{shep laughs derisively. the others give him a look and he shuts up. the drinks arrive. all the men, save cary, snatch up their glasses. bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his martini whole. he watches nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a boy scout trying to start a fire.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then there's her drinking.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what's the matter with my drinking?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're a sissy drinker.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, maybe i can improve.}
<A>__{meanwhile, cary attempts with some success to drink his martini with one unsteady hand. bill inspects nikki's mouth.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then there's her teeth. why, one of 'em is turned sideways.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{you mean this one?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why don't you have it turned around?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, in what respect does it kind of help?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. and you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. so now i don't let anyone kiss me hard.}
<A>__{the men are amused. nikki sips her champagne.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, we'll let that pass.}
<A>__{bill chuckles. shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{where's he gone?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep went off to sharpen his skates.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now, about your nose.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what about my nose?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it isn't straight. it kind of turns up at the end.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, when i was a little girl, i got bumped by a swing.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{how'd you happen to get bumped?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i just walked through the gate. i was only seven.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, poor dear. didn't you see it?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i can't see very far.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{did it hurt?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it made me dizzy all day.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, i guess we can't hold that against her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we all make mistakes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right. michelangelo painted adam with a navel.}
<A>__{bill and nikki laugh at this. suddenly, nikki grows thoughtful.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{all the same, he'd look funny the other way even in a painting.}
<A>__{they all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. frink abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{where's he gone?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he went off to shave a horse.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{have you got a husband or anything?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no husband.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{a mother?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{mother, yes. but we haven't met in quite a long time.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why not in a long time?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, on account of my mother's name was beulah. now, you can't have a mother named beulah. so i changed it to jane. and that's how it all began.}
<A>__{an odd chiming sound distracts them. they look off to see:}
<B>__{francis}
<A>__{the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. he awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. the chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{nikki watches francis' exit curiously. bill waves her off before she can ask:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he's goin' off to tame an alligator.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who is he, anyway?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{francis used to fly with us in the 94th. the best shot in the squadron. brought down twelve planes. used to call him "sudden death." he lost interest after his teammate got killed. he's lonesome is all.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i like him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what kind of chimes?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, westminster, canterbury, and whittington.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i will take vanilla.}
<A>__{cary puts a fist on his hip and gives nikki an exasperated look. taxi horns squeak. francis, shep and frink return from their various adventures and sit down as bill gives nikki his opinion of francis.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think he's a washout.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, just because you're a big bombardier and an all american }

<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{all american what?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{halfback.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, montana state or somewhere. idaho or nebraska or the carlisle indians or something. didn't you never read about bill? bronko bill the alabama flash?}
<A>__{bill grins as nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{i think it's a forgery.}
<A>__{bill's face falls. he looks at nikki.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{say! what do you want me to do? tackle a horse?}
<A>__{she nods. shep is amused.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sure. go ahead. tackle a horse.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(with a dismissive wave)}
<D>__{all right, all right, i will tackle a horse.}
<A>__{shep looks down the street.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{here comes one now.}
<A>__{they all look to see: a horse drawn cab rolling down the street in their direction.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{everyone watches as bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{look out, horse!}
<A>__{the horse drawn cab rolling along as bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.}
<B>__{on the sidewalk}
<A>__{cary, horrified, stands and yells:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey, bill! bill! come back here!}
<A>__{cary runs off, toward bill, leaving a thrilled shep and a worried francis with a distressed nikki. they all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{oh, bill!}
<A>__{at the horse drawn cab cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey! what's the idea runnin' down my friend like that? here!}
<A>__{cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. the cabman protests in french but takes the cash.}

<A>__{of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. standing up now, bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while cary tries to placate the driver.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{never mind. look where you're going in the future now. you just watch out where you're going!}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. the horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive bill away. bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. cary tries to pull bill away as frink, francis and the driver gather around. bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(admonishes bill)}
<D>__{now listen, come on out here, you old fool.}
<P>__{(to the shying horse)}
<D>__{whoa, whoa.}

<D>__{you all right now, brother?}

<C>__{cary}
<D>__{all right. now, you just keep your horse, see? you got your money.}
<A>__{the cabbie salutes cary but pays more attention to his horse.}
<B>__{back at the sidewalk table}
<A>__{the waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. cary, beside him, leads him to his seat. they all sit down under the following:}

<D>__{hey, listen, bill, you're all american, see? you're two all americans! the lady's convinced you're the whole team. you don't have to tackle any more horses. how 'bout that? drink your drink.}

<A>__{cary glances in nikki's direction and tells bill confidentially:}
<C>__{cary}

<D>__{my, my! isn't this nice?!}
<A>__{nearby, the men sit at a roped off table for six on a low balcony. cary and francis sit glumly on one side of the table as bill tries to tell a story to the others (frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "kiss me quick" who appears in this scene only; shep and nikki).}

<A>__{bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. once they've gone, bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands with a little noise on the other side, without waking the clerk. he cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, then fetches nikki's key from its cubbyhole. bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs around nearly kicking the clerk in the process then silently slides off the desk to the floor. watching the sleeping clerk warily, bill tiptoes away. at the last possible moment, bill purposefully whacks the signal bell with his hand, making it ring noisily. the clerk awakens with a start and grabs a nearby telephone just as bill disappears from view.}

<C>__{francis}
<D>__{say, i never saw so many shoes.}
<A>__{the others gather to peer into the closet. frink loses interest immediately but whistles at the sight of nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. he moves to it eagerly. nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as frink picks up her silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. bill pointedly takes the gown out of frink's hand. tight lipped, frink stares at him. suddenly, bill points to a small wind up clock on nikki's night table.}

<D>__{oh, boy! here come the drinks!}
<A>__{the others cheer happily. two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with already poured drinks. shep hands a glass to nikki.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{here, nikki, drink this.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{make you laugh and play.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that's what i want to do, laugh and play.}
<A>__{shep hands bill a glass. francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. he polishes off one and then the other. he leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off. cary, bill and shep crowd around nikki who is still seated all have drinks. the tray carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. bill proposes a toast.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{here's to nikki's dainty legs. as smooth and hairless as an egg.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{wheee!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hurray!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{'ray!}
<A>__{they drink. another knock at the door. they all yell, "entrez!" the door opens to reveal frink whose face falls when he sees the other men with nikki. the others are not happy to see him, either.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well! here comes that licentious old man. who invited him?}
<A>__{cary hands his glass to bill and moves to meet frink as he enters.}
<C>__{frink}
<P>__{(sneering)}
<D>__{still drinking?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(shakes his head mockingly)}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<A>__{cary watches frink approach nikki.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{morning, nikki.}
<A>__{after a pause, nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize him. then she peers at him through her lorgnette.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, it's you.}
<P>__{(after a pause, reluctantly polite)}
<D>__{won't you sit down?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{frink moves off to find a chair. shep sets down his drink and follows him. frink starts to move a chair but shep stops him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{say, i don't think nikki likes you.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{oh, no?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no. what do you wanna hang around for?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{well, what do you hang around for?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{me? why, i came to bring nikki some posies. i will bet you didn't bring nikki any posies.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i well }
<A>__{during the above dialogue, bill nudges cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them. they exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to frink.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{have a drink?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{cure the shakes.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i haven't got the shakes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{let's see. hold out your hands.}
<A>__{bill and shep watch with interest as frink holds out his hands, palms up.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no, turn them over.}
<A>__{frink turns them over, palms down. cary looks at frink's steady hands, impressed.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{say, that's pretty good.}
<A>__{cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{let's see if you can hold this.}
<A>__{cary sets the glass on top of frink's downturned hand. frink balances the full glass with ease.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{say, that's great.}
<A>__{cary places a second full glass on frink's other hand. frink balances both glasses with ease. cary expresses keen admiration.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{steady as a rock!}
<A>__{frink looks at the others, a little smugly. cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others. frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them. cary, shep and bill return to nikki and crowd around her.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, i guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while.}
<A>__{frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{hey. take these off.}
<A>__{but the others simply ignore him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{now, let's see. where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we were talkin' about nikki's legs.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right. we were talkin' about nikki's legs. and havin' a fine time, too.}
<A>__{the asian maid who has been working on nikki's feet abruptly rises.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{finis.}
<A>__{the men cheer, "yay!" and nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools. the men crowd closer to peer down at nikki's legs.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{let's inspect the job.}
<A>__{but nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, my poor toes. don't look too close.}
<A>__{nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. since she's no longer using her footstool, cary commandeers it and sits on it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, what's the matter with your toes?}
<A>__{nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story very slowly. her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well... when i was a little girl...}
<A>__{a worried look crosses cary's face.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... and they were way too short. ...}
<A>__{shep and bill listen soberly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{... and i had to walk all the way to sunday school and back. ... down the road. ... and it was hot and dusty.}

<P>__{(hand to his face)}
<D>__{oh, take her away! she's breakin' my heart!}
<P>__{(sobs)}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and when i got home ... my toes were spoiled.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(on the verge of tears)}
<D>__{oh, dear, oh, dear.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's such a sad story. let's all have a drink, quick!}
<A>__{their eyes pop. the men jump up eagerly and run off. nikki, thoroughly nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. shep, cary and bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing. meanwhile, frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands. for the first time in this scene, nikki is on her feet. she walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of shep and cary.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and now would you all excuse me? on account of i'm gonna put on a dress.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, why not?}
<A>__{nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. the men continue to stand around the tray, drinking. in the background, francis sleeps on the sofa. over by the fireplace, a frustrated frink, still balancing the two drinks, casts a dirty look at the others. he angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace, smashing them loudly. francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps off the sofa. the others stare at him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{my, my. what's he getting so excited about?}
<A>__{frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{you guys think you're so darn smart.}
<A>__{shep, bill and cary laugh at this. cary consults his pocket watch.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, cheerio, fellas. i'm off.}
<A>__{bill waves goodbye. cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{see ya later.}
<A>__{cary exits as nikki's voice drifts in from:}
<B>__{the open bedroom doorway}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{what are the plans for the day?}
<A>__{shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the cluny and play billiards and drink beer.}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{how about cary?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{went to get his hat and coat. he's going to pere lachaise.}
<C>__{nikki }

<D>__{a cemetery. how 'bout you coming with us?}

<D>__{no. i'm going with cary.}

<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{you've been invited?}
<A>__{nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{do you think cary might object?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, i have an idea he'd like to be alone.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{why alone?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, cary likes to be alone. he's as brittle as a breadstick. one silly crack from you and he might break up in sections.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(thinks about this)}
<D>__{well, then, i don't think he should be left alone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me, what's cary doing in paris?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{what are we all doing in paris?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i know. but why doesn't he go home?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, he's not ready to go home. what could he do if he went home? have people cry over his hands?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, it seems a pity to go on like this. he's such a sweet soul.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{one of the best.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{isn't he just sort of wasting himself?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{on the contrary. he's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.}
<A>__{lost in thought, nikki moves off and a worried shep follows her to:}
<B>__{the front door}
<A>__{shep stops nikki from leaving. she's a little downcast as he admonishes her:}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{now, listen. if you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say. don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him.}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{and, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(earnest)}
<D>__{oh, i won't. why, who ever heard of such a thing?}
<A>__{nikki opens the front door and exits into:}
<B>__{the hallway}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{cary?! cary? i'm coming with you.}
<A>__{without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look down at her shoes.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oooh!}
<P>__{(to cary)}
<D>__{ooh, wait for nikki!}
<A>__{she leaves him and runs back to:}

<P>__{(calls back to cary)}
<D>__{wait for nikki!}
<A>__{puzzled, shep follows nikki who rushes to:}
<B>__{her bedroom closet}
<A>__{nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes. shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of red ones.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{what are you changing your shoes for?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{on account of i can walk faster in red shoes.}

<A>__{passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. a taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk cafe la regence, according to the awning that covers the little iron tables. cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as nikki hurries under the awning. cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("restez ici."), looks at the rain.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{could we sit down here, do you suppose?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i think so. would you like something to drink?}
<A>__{they move toward the cafe. as cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what should i drink now, do you suppose?}
<A>__{cary orders the drinks as nikki moves to sit at a table.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{deux picon citrons.}
<A>__{the waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his bartender. cary joins nikki at the table and sits down. she removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following:}

<C>__{cary}
<D>__{very refreshing. make you laugh and play.}

<C>__{cary}
<D>__{don't we all?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{not like shep.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, shep has that tic under his eye, you know. takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but isn't there some kind of treatment or something?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep could never stand a long course of treatment. drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. he's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. so he stays tight.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with the drinks. as he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses, cary leans over to light a cigarette for nikki. the waiter leaves and they drink.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{seems such a pity. how did he get the tic?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{in the war.}

<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, it's not very romantic.}

<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{cary}

<P>__{(looks at nikki)}
<D>__{did you ever dig up an indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice? or explore old trunks in an attic? listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind? see a gypsy caravan?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(enthralled)}
<D>__{so that's why you were happy. on account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?}

<A>__{with a grand gesture, bill presents an elderly british gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "hooray!" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save frink), smoking and drinking. various bottles stand on a central table. the old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger.}

<D>__{no. don't want to walk. let's take a cab.}
<A>__{cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. nikki rests a sympathetic hand on shep.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the back seat of the taxi cab moments later as the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded carnival, the music continues. cary and shep sit on either side of nikki. cary is as edgy as shep is subdued.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{did you see the way francis poured lead into that fellow?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{fast work.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{fast? chain lightning!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{nice shooting.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{those slugs went right past my ear. if i'd've moved an inch, i would've caught one of them myself.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{"sudden death," all right.}
<A>__{nikki takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what's the matter with you, shep? i've never known you so quiet before.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's right. i am kind of quiet.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(holds her unlit cigarette)}
<D>__{not smoking?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{your lighter working?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{good ol', nikki never has any matches.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{as shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter, a strange look crosses his face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sure you want a light?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that's what i want, a light.}
<A>__{shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on revealing bloodstains on his white shirt. nikki stares down at the blood in horror.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{shep. shep!}
<A>__{nikki jumps up and moves away from shep, into a seat opposite.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{shep's hurt!}
<A>__{cary turns to shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{it's a forgery.}
<A>__{cary examines shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{do something for him, cary! oh, shepard!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he's been shot!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what can we do, cary?! what can we do?!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep, why didn't you say you were hurt?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{good old cary. sweet nikki. you may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, shep, shep, don't say that. you'll be all right. we'll get you to a hospital.}
<A>__{shep puts a hand on cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no, no, cary. don't rush me anywheres. let's sit here for a while. the hurts, the jolting.}
<A>__{urgently, cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{in front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. the carousel music drifts in. shep hardly moves head back, blank eyes staring, voice dreamy and weak. cary puts his face close to shep's, listening intently.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's better. you know, cary, i feel just like we're falling long time ago. do you remember? spinning ... spinning ... spinning. only you brought me down safe. oh, cary. good old cary.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{best flyer in the service.}
<A>__{nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, shepard, shepard, darling.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(reassuring)}
<D>__{we're gonna make a safe landing again, shep.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{not this time, cary. ol' shep's gonna crash.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{say, but we're spinning fast. level off. cary, level off.}
<A>__{shep's head slumps down. his face presses against cary's shoulder.}
<C>__{nikki's voice}
<D>__{oh, shepard, shepard, darling.}
<A>__{cary can't look at him. eyes wide, cary slowly presses his cheek to shep's.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep? shep?! shep!}
<A>__{cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. and yet he cannot bring himself to cry.}

<A>__{nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record toselli's "serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted europe at the close of the great war. as the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. then she turns and sidles over to sit next to cary who is seated by the window, scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what are you writing, cary?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{a letter. a letter to shep's mother.}

<C>__{cary}
<D>__{certainly not.}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{why, cary. cary, that's the most beautiful letter i've ever read.}
<A>__{nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{please forgive me for crying, cary. i can't help it. you don't mind if i cry just a minute, do you?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no, nikki.}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{can't you cry, cary?}

<D>__{no.}

<D>__{but you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{long, long time ago. before the war.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and you can't cry now? not even for shep?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep lambert spent his life in the war. he had nothing more to give. he had died once. and he was ready to die again.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{this time he was played out with music. that was the way he wanted it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{and bill talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts. maybe he'll tackle the angel gabriel and be a big success again.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and francis?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{maybe francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping. till the end. it doesn't matter now. without them, nothing matters. we only had each other. comradeship was all we had left. and now that's gone, too.}

<D>__{and you, cary? you? you're alone now.}
<C>__{cary}

<C>__{cary}

<A>__{he kisses her hand. a strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it to reveal a heart shaped stone. cary looks at her in surprise.}

<D>__{why, nikki, you kept it. you didn't forget.}
<A>__{she lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him.}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, i've always wanted a pair of spanish earrings.}
