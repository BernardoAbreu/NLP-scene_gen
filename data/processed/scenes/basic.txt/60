<L>__{exterior styles' office day}
<A>__{hardy and osborne stand before the colonel, filling him in.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{pike killed west, dunbar killed mueller, childs, and nunez.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{who killed pike?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{someone must have got a shot off. he wasn't exactly a moving target.}
<A>__{styles turns to osborne.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it's too neat.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{"too neat." how long have you been an investigator?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i don't think that has anything to do with }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that means under a year. let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic. there are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. dunbar's our guy.}
<A>__{osborne struggles to put it into words.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i just... he came back for kendall. i don't think he's capable of murder.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{everyone's capable of murder, osborne.}
<A>__{osborne turns, making her case to styles.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{look, all we've got is what kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except nunez. he found west, he saw mueller and pike, but just their bodies he didn't see any crime committed.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well, i'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{west's body isn't in the creek bed.}
<A>__{they stop arguing, turning to look at him.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{we've already been over the terrain twice. nothing.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{there was a hurricane, bill, the wind probably moved it.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{without the body we have no physical proof. we need a confession.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{from dunbar? i hate to break this to you, but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{nevertheless }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{not for me.}
<A>__{a beat. almost accusingly:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you mean not enough to save you.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{jag gets here in three hours. try for the confession.}
