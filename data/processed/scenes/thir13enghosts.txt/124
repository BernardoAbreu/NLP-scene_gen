<A>__{arthur takes a long look around at the macabre scene before him. first, to the ghosts that circle the eye, each still trapped in his or her own hell. then arthur focuses on the blades that swirl around him, threatening to dice his family, all that he loves. then arthur looks down into the fiery mechanical purgatory that is the eye of hell, its gigantic gears grinding away, the steel bathed in crimson light, driving the house machine toward its fantastic culmination. finally to the symbols on the outer ring that flash by at arthur's feet. the whole effect does something to arthur. especially the mesmerizing symbols flying by. we suddenly intercut with: flashback pages of arcanum flipping by in the library in flashback, as kalina was explaining the ghosts.}
