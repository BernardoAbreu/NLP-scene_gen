<A>__{modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. a skinny pig roams a barren lot. a group of women with their hair in curlers sit on crates around a dominoes table. they wave their hellos to miguel, who smiles back. local kids play stickball in a trash strewn clearing with makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard. they see miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, shouting his name. as miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, erica (15), buying water from a delivery truck. she smiles. with the kids still clamoring around miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. the kids grab the balls, then run off to play. miguel approaches erica. she puts down her water bucket, gives miguel a hug.}

<D>__{is that all you have to say?}
<A>__{miguel helps erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof. on the lot next to their house, the cinder block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block.}
