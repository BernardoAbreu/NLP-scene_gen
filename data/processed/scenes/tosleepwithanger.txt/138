<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{there is a man lying on a bus bench with his belongings. a spotted dog is standing guard next to the bench. the dog's reflection is caught in a puddle of water. the dog has circles and sixes painted over his body. old john taps on the bench with his pipe. the man lying on the bench stirs and gives old john a wave to indicate that he is alright. old john slowly gets his cart moving again.}
