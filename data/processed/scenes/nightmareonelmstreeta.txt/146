<L>__{interior nancy's room. night.}
<A>__{nancy dials again. this time she gets a busy signal. she slams the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{glen. don't fall asleep...}
<A>__{she goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists. yawns. the telephone rings. nancy snatches it up.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{glen?}
<A>__{tight on her, zooming even closer on her ear and the earpiece as we hear the awful scritching scrape of steel fingerknives. nancy slaps the phone down as if it were diseased then, in pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall. spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and lays it on her bed, chiding herself.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{brilliant. now what if glen calls?}
<A>__{she wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it on her bed, then sneaks back to the door. this time she gives an expression of relief, and opens the door. marge is gone. then the telephone rings again. camera moves in on nancy as she turns slowly. reverse in her pov. the telephone rings again, despite the fact that the end of its janked out cord is clearly visible. the nightmare music theme slips right up our spines. back on nancy. she starts to shake. she goes to the telephone as we widen, unwraps it as it rings even louder. she's shaking so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver. move in close on her, so close we can hear her teeth chattering as she brings the phone to her ear.}
<C>__{nancy }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the unmistakeable voice of fred krueger comes over the phone, garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.}
<C>__{krueger }
<P>__{(triumphant)}
<D>__{i'm your boyfriend now...}
<A>__{close on the mouthpiece. it's changed from a normal telephone mouthpiece to an actual mouth fred krueger's mouth and his long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's mouth ! wider as nancy explodes from her micro dream absolutely mad. she jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands, smashing it to smithereens. angle on the telephone pieces. normal pieces of a normal telephone. she pinches herself hard until tears come and her flesh is nearly bleeding.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i'm awake, i am awake. this is not a dream! i am }
<A>__{she stops, realizing what krueger meant.}
<C>__{nancy }
<D>__{my boyfriend...!}
