<L>__{exterior mountain road day}
<A>__{xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up. he passes several of ivan's police jeeps at a furious clip. up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the mountain.}

<D>__{where's he headed?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{he owns a big industrial complex on the river. he'll launch it from there.}
<A>__{xander floors it. up ahead, in the flatbed truck, yorgi drives. he can see the gto gaining on them.}

<P>__{(in russian, subtitled)}
<D>__{they're coming! get back there.}
<A>__{kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. he lays down, resting the rifle on the ahab container. as the gto comes into view, he sights up and fires, whack! the first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows the headrest off xander's seat.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you get down! i will take care of this fool!}
<A>__{he pulls out an mp 5 out and hangs it out the window.}

<A>__{another shot blasts through, taking off the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{goddamit! he's gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable!}
<A>__{kirill laughs and takes aim once again. he puts petra in the sights. xander jerks the steering wheel and blam! the shot goes wide. the gto veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain. xander fights for control as they slide around the turns. the road flattens out and they can see the industrial complex up ahead. they cut across a field, heading right for it.}
