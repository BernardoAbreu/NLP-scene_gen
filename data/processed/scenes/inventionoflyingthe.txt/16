<L>__{interior mark's car morning}
<A>__{as mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world. a homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that reads: "i don't understand why i'm homeless and all of you are not." a business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up next to mark at a red light.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{i'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. i only want people to assume i'm very busy.}
<A>__{at another red light mark eavesdrops on a couple having a loud argument in front of a coffee shop.}
<C>__{girlfriend}
<D>__{i woke up this morning and realized that, not only do i not love you, but that the thought of touching you sickens me.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{the more you hate me the more i fall in love with you.}
<A>__{a bus passes in front of mark's car. angle on: the bus ad simply shows a can of pepsi, and reads: "pepsi. when they don't have coke." a car honks behind mark. the man leans out of his car and yells at mark.}
<C>__{honking man}
<D>__{move it, fatty!}
<A>__{mark drives forward, waving to the man apologetically as the man zooms past him.}
