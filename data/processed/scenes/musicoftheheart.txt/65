<L>__{exterior central park a little later}
<A>__{brian and roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead of them, dragging sticks along the pavement. in the b.g. we see harlem streets bordering the park.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you seem to be the only one who can get nick to laugh these days.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{he misses his dad. i'm just a surrogate.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{no i think nick really likes you.}
<P>__{(taking his arm)}
<D>__{you know... we're all hoping you'll move into the new house with us.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{whoa. can we just slow down here a minute? it's too much like getting married.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what's so bad about that?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that kind of commitment just isn't realistic. i mean, how can we know that you and i will even be able to stand each other in five years?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, we don't. but if two people care about each other, they take a chance.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{and look what happened to you and charles.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i'm not talking about charles. i'm talking about us.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{look, roberta. marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs. i just don't buy that.}
<A>__{this is making her nervous. she looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{what are you saying? if there's some need you have that i don't meet, you'd go and get it "met" by someone else?}
<A>__{he heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. one out of two marriages ends in divorce!}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if i don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship forget marriage for a minute; i'm just talking about a relationship would you go to someone else?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{in theory, yes.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{in theory.}
<A>__{roberta looks very disheartened. brian feels badly.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{roberta, we've got something good right now that's the important thing. let's just keep it that way, o.k.?}
<A>__{he pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away from him. on nick, observing with an anxious expression.}
