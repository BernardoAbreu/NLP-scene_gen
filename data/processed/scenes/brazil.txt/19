<A>__{to the girl in long shot. the monolith rises up into frame partially cutting her off from view. before sam can do anything, another stone skyscraper breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. then another and another. there is nothing sam can do. the girl is being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures. and then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis. sam lies closer. the stone skyscrapers appear to be solid. no windows. no doors. nothing whatsoever to interfere with their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. as he flies among these towering blocks he sees no sign of the girl, only sheer walls rising high above him. below him the walls plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. no sound but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in this dead place. coming round a corner he sees something in the distance. far below him a dark procession is wending its way through the narrow passages... away from him.}
