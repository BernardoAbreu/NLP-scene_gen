<L>__{62 cafeteria rue michelet. inside. day. 6:30 p.m.}
<A>__{cafeteria, rue michelet 1. the club is very crowded. there are two rooms; one at the entrance with an american style bar, and one at the back with tables. it is saturday, and at this hour many european families go out to have an ice cream. there is not too much confusion or uproar. the people are calm, they take their places at the bar and small tables, and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly. hassiba enters, glances at the large clock above the cash register. it is half past six. she goes to the register and waits her turn. the different orders mingle; she orders a coca cola. they give her the check. she pays. she goes to the bar; all the seats are taken. she gives her order and the ticket to the waiter. a man moves aside, looks at her, then steps down from his stool and offers it to her. hassiba tells him that it doesn't matter, but the man insists. hassiba thanks him and sits down. the man is about fifty, well groomed. he smiles again, and turns to chat with some friends. hassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat, then removes the bag from her shoulder. holding it by the strap, she places it on the floor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean one's feet. the waiter has brought her the drink. hassiba drinks slowly, from time to time glancing at the clock. she finishes drinking. the bag is in a vertical position. moving her feet slowly and carefully, hassiba lets the bag slip on its side. she gets down from the seat, and points it out to the man who is standing next to her.}
