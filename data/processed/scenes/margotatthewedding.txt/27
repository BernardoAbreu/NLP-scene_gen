<C>__{margot}
<D>__{dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we didn't invite them to the wedding.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're not really friends.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we're friends enough that's it's awkward. maisy baby sits for us all the time.}

<D>__{you're competitive with everyone. it doesn't matter if they even do the same thing as you.}

<D>__{he's competitive with bono.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's true. i don't subscribe to the credo that there's enough room for everyone to be successful. i think there are only a few spots available and people like dick koosman and bono are taking them up.}
