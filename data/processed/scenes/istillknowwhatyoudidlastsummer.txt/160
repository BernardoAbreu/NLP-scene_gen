<L>__{interior hotel attic night}
<A>__{julie, karla, and nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. they fumble with it }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{there's no way to lock it.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<A>__{from below comes laughter. there's a tug on the hatch, cracking it open. the girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip. there's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see ben. then, the rope snaps. the hatch slams shut.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{there's no way to grip this thing.}
<A>__{suddenly the steel tip of the hook pokes through the crack...it wriggles around...turning...and begins to pull the hatch down. they try to hold it...but it's no use. they let go and jump away. the attic is lit by a cathedral window. it's crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{watch your step...}
<A>__{thunk! karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.}
