<A>__{malahide walks swiftly down the corridor in which we saw him talk to ronson earlier, but this time the camera follows him through the double doors and further down the corridor. he enters an elevator and the doors close in front of him.}
<L>__{interior basement corridor day}
<A>__{malahide exits the elevator into a lower corridor, one not so carefully decorated. we are in the area in which the more deeply disturbed of the institute's patients live. the rooms are smaller, closer together, and there is an observation panel set in each door. malahide looks into the first four rooms. in the first, a middle aged, overweight woman sits completely motionless in the middle of the floor. she is dressed in a shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged. her head is shaven, her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets so that only white shows. in the second, a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as tight as he can be into one corner of the room. his hair is long and he has a full beard. he is naked but not unadorned his body and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement. in the third, a man of about malahide's age stands in the centre of the room. he is of normal build but his head is shaved. his face, scalp, and hands are covered in self inflicted and amaterurish tattoos all of crosses. he is dressed in t shirt and jeans. with both hands he holds aloft a silver crucifix, pointing it in all directions, as if under constant siege by devils. he mutters prayers and invocations constantly. in the fourth, a man in his early twenties restrained in a strait jacket. he shuffles around on the call floor, his eyes twitching and flitting from one part of his body to another.}
