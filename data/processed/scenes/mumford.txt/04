<D>__{...next time.}
<A>__{we see mumford's office: the office of a psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. it's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [the movie is now in color.] his patient, henry follett, looks nothing like the newcomer in the soft core fantasy he's been narrating. instead, he's a mild looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter ego. follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at mumford.}

<D>__{i have eighteen more minutes!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't want to hear any more today.}

<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{mr. follett, do you trust me or don't you?}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{well, i don't know... i only been seeing you }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{without trust, there's no point to any of this. you might as well not come.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{now hold on, i didn't say i didn't want to come }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{good, then go.}
