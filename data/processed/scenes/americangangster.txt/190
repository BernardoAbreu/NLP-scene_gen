<L>__{int exterior tony zaca's house day}
<A>__{tony's wife and daughters can be seen in the suburban backyard. here in the kitchen tony and richie watch kernels of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first amana microwave oven. it's noisier than modern ones.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{the fuck is a `micro' wave?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's a scientific force like atomic energy. it rearranges the molecules.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{of what.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{of anything. of popcorn. you don't want to put your head in there.}
<A>__{tony rakes out the plain, `pre microwaveable' popcorn, using his hand. gives some to richie. half of it's burnt.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i can get you one of these. just like this, brand new. i will have it delivered.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{no, thanks. i don't want one.}
<A>__{tony hands richie some snapshots: the zaca family on the slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow dotted cabin.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{this is nice, where's this?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{aspen. just got back. had a great time.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i'd like to ski aspen some day.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{know who we met? burt reynolds. i'm not kidding. lot of people from hollywood go up there now, buying up everything.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{this is your place?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{are you kidding? you know what it's worth? ski in ski out, five bedrooms, sauna, everything. we were guests.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no ... no, that's your place.}
<A>__{everything seems to stop. richie becomes aware of the sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside ...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{isn't there something we can do about leaving the big guy alone? you know who i mean.}
<A>__{what richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at this point he's got a problem.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{if i don't report what you just said to me, you know i could be in a lot of trouble. if i do, then it's you.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i'm hoping you won't do that.}
<A>__{richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i'm not taping it. how do you know? because we're friends and i'm telling you. this is a real offer.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{from who, your uncle?}
<P>__{(tony doesn't say)}
<D>__{why would you do this? why would you risk our friendship?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{because i care what happens to you.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you shouldn't have done it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i had to. i had no choice. neither do you. leave frank lucas alone.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{he's not important enough for you to do this.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yes, he is.}
<A>__{richie stares at tony, then puts the pictures in his hand.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{tell marie i'm sorry i had to leave. you can tell her why.}
