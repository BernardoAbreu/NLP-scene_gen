<L>__{interior lower east side railroad flat bedroom morning}
<A>__{subtitle: "eight years later" tiny kitchen, clutter, a messenger bike hanging from hooks on the wall, a lot of books. there is a phone ringing under the bed. tyler roth, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. he is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket. a guitar is on his lap. tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of music against a box of off brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face. a forgettable blonde lies sleeping on the bed. tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the phrases of music in front of him. he is completely lost in the moment, with deep grooves in his fingers. by the ashtray next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours. the blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...}

<P>__{(out of it)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. his eyes widen in alarm.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{of course. i'm on my way. i know...i know...i know...i know.}
<A>__{tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants. before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a tattoo that simply says "michael" over his heart. he searches through a beat up chest of drawers, seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt...}
<D>__{tyler v o gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it...}
<A>__{...and scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher brush.}
<D>__{tyler v o ...i tend to agree with the first part.}
