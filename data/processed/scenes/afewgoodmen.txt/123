<A>__{a waitress sets two drinks down in front of kaffee and ross, who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the back.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{that was nice work today. the redirect on howard.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i have markinson.}
<A>__{ross only takes a moment digest this.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{a motel room in arlington with 14 federal marshals outside his door. take a sip of your drink.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{damn.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{the transfer order that parkinson signed is phoney. and jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. but in the meantime i'm gonna put the apostle jon kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun.}
<A>__{ross takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the line for kaffee..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse kendrick or jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to court martial for professional misconduct. and that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. i'm not saying this to intimidate you. i'm being your lawyer.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{thanks, jack. and i wanna tell you that i think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. and this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{don't you dare lump me in with jessep and markinson and kendrick because we wear the same uniform. i'm your friend, danny, and i'm telling you, i don't think your clients belong in jail. but i don't get to make that decision. i represent the government of the united states. without passion or prejudice. and my client has a case.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i've been so advised.}
<A>__{ross stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you got bullied into that courtroom, danny. by everyone. by dawson, by galloway, shit, i practically dared you. not for a second have you believed you could win. you got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're a lousy softball player, jack.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{your boys are going down. i can't stop it anymore.}
