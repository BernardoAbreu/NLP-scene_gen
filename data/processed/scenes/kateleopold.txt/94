<L>__{interior hallway later that night}
<A>__{the corridor is darkly lit. kate leaves the bathroom as leopold enters. they collide and separate but remain close together. both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ooops. bread and butter.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{bread and butter. it's an old saying... well not to you i guess. you say it when you pass someone in a cramped space. as close as bread and butter.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so. did you have a good time last night?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it was very interesting.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{did you find that person of quality?}
<A>__{leopold looks at her a moment.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{yes. i did.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well... fine.}
<P>__{(there is a pause)}
<D>__{i guess it's time to turn in.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{she reaches her door. leopold stops her.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{kate?}
<A>__{she turns. leopold grasps for the words but the habit of inaction returns.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<P>__{(he slowly closes the door)}
