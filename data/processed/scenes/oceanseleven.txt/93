<A>__{the painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van gogh and a monet. at a distance, admiring it, are tess, the seller and the seller's aide de camp. a staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby. off to the side, in a sharp blazer, tess stands transfixed by the painting.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{he painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break up with fernande olivier.}
<C>__{seller}
<D>__{she must have put him through hell.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{you can see the conflict. he makes her both erotic and grotesque. he's hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy. aide de camp}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{mr. santaniello has an early flight. do you think mr. benedict will be late?}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{mr. benedict is never late.}
<A>__{just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and terry benedict enters, right on time. he is elegant, beaming, commanding. all that's missing is a blare of trumpets.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{am i late?}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{not at all, mr. benedict.}
<P>__{(greeting him)}
<D>__{allow me to introduce to you mr. jean santaniello.}
<C>__{benedict}
<P>__{(to seller)}
<D>__{mr. santaniello, i apologize if i kept you. i had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. i gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.}
<C>__{seller}
<D>__{i understand it's going to be a hell of a fight.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{we hope.}
<A>__{tess angles benedict toward the painting.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{here it is.}
<A>__{benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he catches tess in his glance, and his smile deepens. then:}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{magnificent! i've been following her for fifteen years now. at last i've made her a home.}
<P>__{(to tess)}
<D>__{all the arrangements and so forth...}
<C>__{seller}
<D>__{done. she's yours.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{not mine. she belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. isn't that right, ms. ocean?}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{yes, mr. benedict.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{she's lovely, isn't she?}
<P>__{(as the seller is}
<D>__{confused; benedict}
<P>__{specifies painting)}
<D>__{i can't be the only one who was after her.}
<C>__{seller}
<D>__{you're the only one who met my price.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{ah, but this... you can't put a price on beauty. but i shouldn't philosophize. i own casinos, after all. aide de camp can we get a quick shot? mr. santaniello has a plane to catch.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{of course, of course.}
<A>__{tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo. benedict and the seller pose together and... flash!}
