<L>__{interior landing. night.}
<A>__{on the tiny landing, salim and jamal pull back a curtain to reveal a humping couple. they move on, past more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex, not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. they reach the end of the landing. from the other side of the door comes the filmi music. jamal puts his eye to one of the gaps in the slatted door. through it he can see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. latika; though not the rag picker of before. now fifteen, she is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing, turquoise, silk sari.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{is it her or not?}
<A>__{he shoves jamal out of the way and watches.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{shit, she's sexy, man....}
<A>__{then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the limited frame salim can see and snaps a stick down hard on latika's hand.}
<C>__{dance teacher}
<D>__{smile! flow, flow! you entice with the hands not make chapattis, you gawaar. again.}
<A>__{the man starts the music again and latika's hands flow elegantly around her head.}
<C>__{dance teacher }
<D>__{lift your feet, you lump. stop, stop!}
<A>__{the stick is raised to hit her but jamal opens the door.}
