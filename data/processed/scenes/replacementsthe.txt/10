<A>__{the room's blinds are pulled tightly against the bright sunlight. only the blue light of a tv illuminates anything. suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give out with a loud piercing wail. the door to the room bangs open and an english male nurse named augustine ripley, dressed in white, comes running in. he's carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at the ready. he runs to the bed of the still wailing edward francis o'neil (75). o'neil is hooked up to an oxygen tank, watching the just completed redskin game with the sound off.}

<D>__{did they win or lose?!}
<A>__{o'neil continues to wail.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{that has the distinct tonal quality of a loss.}
<A>__{he puts one needle down and jabs o'neil with the other one. he murmurs to the old man as he injects him.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{nice medicine for a loss. keeps us calm. makes us not so sad. keeps us on an even keel. gives us some perspective, doesn't it? and we'll save the winning medicine for next sunday, won't we?}
<A>__{he finishes.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{if you keep talking to me like i'm a five year old, i'm going to hurt you.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{sounds exciting.}
<A>__{he reaches for the phone and hits the speed dial.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{we'll want to talk to coach now, won't we?}
