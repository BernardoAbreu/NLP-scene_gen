<L>__{interior shephered's bedroom late afternoon}
<A>__{sydney is going through the closet in search of something. the door opens, and shepherd steps in, perhaps a little tentatively. he doesn't see sydney at first.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{syd?}
<A>__{sydney comes out.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{have you seen a gray cableknit sweater?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{a grey...sweater? no. i called you at the office, but...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's beth's. i wore it here one time, and i didn't want to leave it.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{where were you going?}
<A>__{sydney continues her search.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm going home, and then i'm going to hartford.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{connecticut?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes. do you know if it was sent with your dry cleaning by any }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{what's in connecticut?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{richard reynolds' campaign. he may be able to get me a job.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{when did you decide to get a new job?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{not long after leo solomon fired me from my old one. beth's gonna kill me. she loves that }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{why did he fire you?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{total failure to achieve any of the objectives for which i was hired. i told him he was being unreasonable. after all, i did get to dance with the president and ride in air force one a couple of times. but you know those prickly environmentalists. it's always gonna be something with them. if it's not clean air, then it's clean water. like it isn't good enough that i'm on the cover of people magazine.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i will call him.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you'll call him? you mean you'll call him yourself? personally? it'll come from the president? that's a great idea. i think you should call leo and make a deal. he hires me back for, say, 72 days. i go around scaring the hell out of congress, making them think that the president's about to drive through a very damaging and costly bill. they'll believe me, right, 'cause i'm the president's friday night girl. now i don't know if you can dip into this well twice, especially since i've lost all credibility in politics, but you never know, i might just be able to pull it off again. i might be able to give you just the leverage you need to pass some ground breaking piece of crime legislation like a mandatory three day waiting period before a five year old can buy an uzi. fuck the sweater she'll have to learn to live with disappointment.}
<A>__{she starts to exit}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{what do you think went on here today?}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i know exactly what went on here today. i got screwed. you saw the poll, you needed the crime bill, you couldn't get it on your own, so i got screwed.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{the environment got screwed. nothing happened to you today, sydney. governing is choosing. governing is prioritizing. i've made no secret of the fact that the crime bill was my top priority.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well then, congratulations. it's only taken you three years to put together crime prevention legislation that has no hope of preventing crime.}
<A>__{sydney heads out the door }
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{sydney. please. i don't want to lose you over this.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president, you got bigger problems than losing me. you just lost my vote.}
<A>__{and sydney is out the door... ...we hold on shepherd, looking like a man who's taken a lot of punches to the heads...}
