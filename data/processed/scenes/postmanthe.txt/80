<A>__{riding into a blizzard, abby leads the way up a zigzag path. a valley opens up below. the unconscious postman lies bundled on the travois.}

<A>__{a little square shape just visible beyond a creek. abby leads the horse and travois bound postman to it.}

<A>__{one room. dirt floor. the windows rattle in the wind. snow falls through a hole in the roof. the wooden door bursts back and abby enters. half frozen, she leads the horse and the travois right inside.}
<L>__{interior hunting shack night}
<A>__{a fire has been lit. the postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as abby washes around his wound. she pulls the shirt back to clean his chest. the material falls away and abby stops short. there high on his biceps a branded "8." she stares in disbelief.}
