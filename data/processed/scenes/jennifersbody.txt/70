<A>__{the door of the van slides open. nikolai pulls jennifer out of the van and hustles her into the clearing. he looks up into the sky.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{we got a waxing moon. perfection.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{you're the man, wolf.}
<A>__{the four band members surround jennifer, looking statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles. without warning, nikolai hauls off and kicks jennifer. she yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt. dirk looks apprehensive.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{i don't know if we should go through with this.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from maroon 5? or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser?}
<C>__{dirk}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{maroon 5.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual! god.}
<A>__{dirk obediently heads over to the van. he pushes the intimidating looking magical books aside and retrieves a single folded piece of computer paper.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{what? i found it on google.}
<A>__{he unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat. the guys have dragged jennifer onto the makeshift altar and are holding her down. she struggles and screams, but dirk slaps her again.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{we come here tonight to sacrifice the body of...}
<A>__{he tries to remember jennifer's name and fails.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{...this chick from devil's kettle.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{my name is jennifer.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{that's fascinating.}
<A>__{dirk and mick exchange nervous glances.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{please let me go. i will do anything. anything you want.}
<A>__{nikolai examines her with an appraising eye.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i only hump nines and tens. you're a seven at best, even with the chicken cutlets.}
<A>__{he reaches into jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a gel breast enhancer, tossing it aside. jennifer rears up and spits in his artfully rumpled hair. nikolai smooths his `do, enraged.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i'm gonna carve you like a pumpkin, bitch. don't you know that me and my boys are in league with the beast himself?}
<A>__{he wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{we've spent months making offerings to the "man downstairs," and whaddya know? satan delivered! we went from college radio to being courted by the majors in two months.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{but that's not enough, jenny. we want designer drugs. we want groupies that have their own groupies. we want speedballs and stadium tours and skittles sorted by color. in short, we want more. and to get more, we have to butcher you. and bleed you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{maybe you could just hire a publicist. make some t shirts or something. hey, i could be on your street team!}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{sorry, darling.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{start chanting, boys.}
<A>__{the group begins chanting jibberish in unison. jennifer struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{with deepest malice, we deliver this virgin unto thee.}
<A>__{he unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it psycho style, admiring his reflection in the blade.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{dude, that is a hot murder weapon!}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{it's a bowie knife.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{bowie. nice.}
<A>__{snickering, nikolai begins to sing "starman" by david bowie. the group joins in merrily.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{"there's a starman waiting in the sky..."}
<C>__{band}
<D>__{"he'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds..."}
<A>__{as the group sings, nikolai brings the knife down with a grin. we hear jennifer screaming, sounds of violence and clothes ripping as nikolai relentlessly beats her and stabs her, his face contorting demonically. the band continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees. nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls rushes into a black hole. he drops the murder weapon into the churning water, smiling.}
