<A>__{forsythe and st. luc are hurrying to forsythe's apartment to see if kresimir is still there. as they round a corner, they see the spergazzis coming toward them, the old lady hobbling and hysterical, the old man helping her walk as best he can, trying to maintain some kind of calm. when spergazzi sees st. luc, he lifts his four pronged cane and waves it around to get attention.}
