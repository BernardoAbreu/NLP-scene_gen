<A>__{raoul has just received orders from general fromberge, who sits at a map table, raoul salutes and follows a young staff officer from the tent. as raoul leaves, the general withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter parchment, with blue and gold seals. fromberge touches the edge of the parchment to the candle, and burns the letter...}
<L>__{exterior trench darkness}
<A>__{two men move along a deep trench, the siege works of 17th century siege warfare. one of the men is raoul, carrying a musket; in his new uniform he looks out of place among the dirty, battle weary men they pass. he is following the staff officer who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are already dead, while raoul's are wide and wild. the trench is deep as a grave; by crouching, both men keep their heads below the surrounding ground. thick smoke rolls over their heads; we can't tell if it is day or night. from all around come sounds of battle, with the sporadic fire of muskets and the rumble of cannons; officers shout orders in the distance; wounded men nearby whimper for water and the officer leads raoul by them as if they did not exist. the young staff officer stops at a bend in the trench.}

<D>__{here.}
<A>__{without another word he goes back the way he came. raoul grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the trench. he has little time to wonder what will happen nexterior a horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the french soldiers clamber out of their breastworks. for an instant, raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins the charge with a shout of his own }

<D>__{mi cheeelllll!! }
<A>__{on the stone wall looming above the french soldiers, orange blossoms of fire the muzzle flash of primitive cannons penetrate the smoke, and the ground at raoul's feet explodes, hurling him backwards. he covered barely a few feet, and falls almost exactly where he started. dead.}
