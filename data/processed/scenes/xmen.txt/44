<A>__{a clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base of a rocky rise. the helicopter touches down. the pilot, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing kelly and guyrich to the intense wind of the rotors. they cover their eyes, cowering. kelly's p.o.v. two figures come out of a hole in the mountain. one seems extremely larger than the other. guyrich and kelly step out. as they get closer he can make out magneto and sabretooth.}

<D>__{dear god... dear... god.}
<A>__{the pilot removes his helmet to reveal: pyro, smiling.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{kelly is utterly confused. as magneto nears, guyrich steps forward to greet him, putting arms around magnetois neck and kissing him deeply. then magneto looks deep and lovingly into guyrichis eyes. and with that guy shape shifts into a beautiful woman who herefore will be known as mystique. her body is covered in iridescent blue scales, which complement her lovely, solid yellow eyes. kelly, of course, is shocked. mystique shows a little hip, raising the scales at her mid section mockingly, as the last of what we thought was guyrich slips underneath.}

<D>__{you... wha... who are you... where is henry?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{mr. guyrich has been dead for some time senator.}

<D>__{you mutant bastards...}
<A>__{pyro grabs the senator as he runs back for the helicopter in vain.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{whatever you do to me... no matter what youill make me right. every word i have spoken will be confirmed.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{gosh, i hope so.}
<A>__{as kelly struggles against all hope.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{people like you are the reason people like me exist.}
<A>__{and with that, mystique walks up.}
<C>__{mystique}
<D>__{and people like you are the reason i was afraid to go to school as a child.}
<A>__{with that, mystique punches kelly. knocking him out cold.}
