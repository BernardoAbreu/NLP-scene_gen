<L>__{exterior the great plains south dakota dawn}
<A>__{the very landscape from opening image. gentle waves of land, rolling out to touch the black hills. the sun rises up out of the distant silhouette like a waking god. heartbeat drum. hypnotic. and then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and gypsum. zoooom! right by us. gone. when a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal sign at roadside becomes visible. it reads, through punched and rusted bullet holes: "entering bear creek indian reservation." heartbeat drum calls in the high pitched, mournful voices of lakota singers. the same haunting song.}
