<L>__{exterior township day}
<A>__{as the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads }
<D>__{one team, one country}
<A>__{ brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun. one of the big kids gets the r100. attention focussed on}
<D>__{that }
<A>__{ until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the springboks exit, one by one. pienaar first, with a huge net bag of practise balls over his shoulder. the springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. the kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable. until chester williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder. now, the kids can relate to the springboks. even sipho, who looks on from the side of the field. springbok management notes it. the tv crews note it. pienaar notes it.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{okay chester i reckon you're up.}
<C>__{chester williams}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{what you do best.}
<A>__{pienaar turns to the throng.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{who wants to play rugby?}
<A>__{a roar. they all do. pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to chester.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{let rip.}
<A>__{chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.) pienaar tosses balls to the others.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{let's do our best.}
<A>__{one after another, the springboks kick the balls high into the air.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{go get them!}
<A>__{the kids go after them. sipho stays on the sideline.}
<B>__{begin rugby clinic montage}
<A>__{barely controlled chaos. each springbok works with one ball and a group of kids. there are three themes to this montage. first, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{who here knows the first rule of rugby?}
<C>__{township kid}
<D>__{me!}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{township kid}
<D>__{only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking!}
<A>__{laughter. a good ice breaker.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{no. the first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways.}
<A>__{pienaar demonstrates. (note: all the rules are demonstrated.)}
<C>__{various springboks}
<D>__{ if you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. this is a scrum. you kick forwards.}
<C>__{various springboks }
<D>__{if you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. this is a lineout. you score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. that's five points. another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. three points for a penalty kick. three points for a drop kick. have you got all that?}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass. whoever drops the ball does pushups!}
<A>__{second, as the players work with the kids, they get into it. much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy the kids, they enjoy the giving. even the grumpiest, most conservative springbok.}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{okay. who wants to scrum against me?}
<A>__{one huge man scrums against a horde of kids. he pushes them backwards with a roar then lets them push him backwards. they love it, the cameras love it. the third theme shows the emergence of chester williams as the face of the springboks. the crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other player's crew. given chester's basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming. the tv cameras follow him even more closely than they follow pienaar. at one point, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at sipho's feet. he hesitates, then picks it up. he doesn't just hold it, he feels it. end the montage as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms. one blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away.}
