<L>__{int karaoke bar night}
<A>__{summer is in a back booth with some co workers when tom walks in to the crowded place. mckenzie has the microphone and he's singing "every rose has its thorn" by poison. he's real into it and, well, it's kinda sad. tom waves to mckenzie and walks over to the booth.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{hey! they said you weren't coming.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you asked if i was coming?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean...my plans got cancelled...}
<A>__{tom is at a loss. there's yet another awkward silent beat between them. thankfully, it's interrupted by...}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<P>__{(already drunk)}
<D>__{goddamn that song is brilliant! what's up hansen?}
<A>__{summer sees the next song come up on the screen.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{ooh that's me.}
<A>__{she downs a shot and jumps up on stage.}
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(into mic)}
<D>__{ok. i'm the new girl so no making fun of me.}
<A>__{her co workers whistle and cheer her on. she takes a deep breath as the opening bars of "born to run" begin to play and summer starts to sing. tom sees summer as the actress in whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a midget in a tuxedo.) later. tom sits in the booth with mckenzie (doing a shot) as summer chats with co workers at another table. tom can't help but stare at summer. she notices and waves. he smiles, hopeful that she'll come over. she doesn't. he hides his disappointment. later. tom walks back to his table with drinks. summer is there in mid conversation with mckenzie.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you were great up there, by the way.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{well you can't go wrong with the boss.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(sitting down)}
<D>__{i hear that.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{hey, did you know tom here's from jersey?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{lived there til i was}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i named my cat after springsteen.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no kidding? what's his name?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{bruce.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that makes sense.}
<A>__{she laughs. she's really cute when she laughs.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{so you got a boyfriend?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{me? no.}
<A>__{tom shoots daggers at mckenzie for that comment. mckenzie mouths "what?" summer sees nothing.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{don't really want one.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{come on. i don't believe that.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{you don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent?}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you a lesbian?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{no, i'm not a lesbian. i'm just not comfortable being somebody's "girlfriend." i don't want to be anybody's anything, you know?}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{it sounds selfish, i know, but... i just like being on my own. relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. who needs all that? we're young. we're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.}
<C>__{summer }
<D>__{i say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but...what if you meet someone and fall in love?}
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{love? you seriously believe in that stuff?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{interesting. a real romantic.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{oh you have no idea. this one... embarrassing. there was this one girl,}
<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{i gotta tell this story }
<A>__{tom elbows mckenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i don't even know what that word means. i know i've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. and i know that today most marriages end in divorce. like my parents.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well mine too but }
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{oh yeah, and i read in newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. is that the love you're talking about?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{why, what's your take on it?}
