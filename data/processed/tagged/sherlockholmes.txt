<C>__{watson }
<D>__{the year was 1891. london was the capital of the world the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. it was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained.}
<A>__{gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a pool of light onto the street, silhouetting a man making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{i had come to london, ten years prior, to find a life after the afghan war. i had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. the life i found was anything but nice and steady.}
<A>__{we can see that the man wears a cape. the distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. a furious clatter of hooves approaches in the distance. the man tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{and that had everything to do with one man. my friend, my partner, my burden...}
<A>__{the man exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{... sherlock holmes.}
<A>__{wham! the man in the deerstalker hat is knocked flat by a running man who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. the running man leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. the man in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{sherlock holmes?!}
<A>__{sherlock holmes offers the handle of the umbrella to the man, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my apologies. send the bill to john watson, 221b baker street.}
<A>__{sherlock holmes sprints off down an alleyway. the man takes a step into the road to watch him go and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of police carriages, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, victorian style.}
<L>__{2 interior carriage closeup on the officers night}
<A>__{inside. big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry a}
<L>__{19th century swat team. one man stands out as a leader,}
<A>__{older than the rest, inspector lestrade. a man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers: dr. john watson, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. a thinking man of action.}
<L>__{exterior streets of london night}
<A>__{almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river. as the carriage banks, we see holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door. we pull back to see the facade of st. paul's cathedral.}
<L>__{interior cathedral crypts entrance night}
<A>__{holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell. he takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be. holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it. he stops at the doorway and peers round the corner. a lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards holmes. holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door. a bowler hatted man ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun. he peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face. the man swings the lantern away again. he peers about, confused. we see holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. first point of attack.}
<A>__{pre visualization in vari speed focus on the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw the most vulnerable pointerior holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (ultra slow motion) as he makes contact. the man's head is thrown back as he spins round.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming.}
<A>__{back to 24 fps. the man's mouth opens to cry out. we ramp back up to 400 fps as his adam's apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{stink of alcohol, heavy drinker knuckles to liver.}
<A>__{back to 24 fps, ramping to 400 fps as a devastating knuckle punch to the liver doubles up the bowler hatted thug and crumples him to his knees. second time action super fast repeat of above holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing. thwack! hammer blow to ear. crack! karate chop to throat. whap! knuckle punch to liver. back to normal motion as the man crumples to the ground, holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move. holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase. pov bottom of the spiral staircase another bowler hatted thug approaches the bottom of the staircase. he has seen the lantern light. he draws his gun and approaches. holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows.}
<C>__{thug}
<D>__{what's goin' on, john?}
<A>__{when he gets no answer, the thug points his gun to where we saw holmes hide. but holmes appears from the shadows behind the thug, reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol whips him twice with his own gun, dropping him. holmes extracts a cigar from the thug's top pocket and sniffs it appreciatively.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hhhmm, good cigar. who do you work for?}
<A>__{he jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the crypts.}

<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{holmes surveys the scene at a distance, out of sight. eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when a heavy hand falls on his shoulder. pull back to reveal (the following exchange in whispers.)}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson. perfect timing.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{nice hat.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{just got it. where's lestrade?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{getting his troops in formation. is that your blood or theirs?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i don't know. it's an old shirt.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you left this behind.}
<A>__{watson hands him his pistol. holmes looks at it with distaste, doesn't take it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{knew i'd forgotten something. thought i'd left the stove on.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you did.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{right. shall we?}
<A>__{this is what they do. this is what they like.}

<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the two hard men on guard turn fast and gather together as they hear footsteps approaching.}
<D>__{man #1 des?}
<A>__{he can see the hat, but not the man underneath.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yeah, s'me.}
<A>__{watson takes out the two men. he is more of a brawler, using headbutts, knees, and elbows. less artful, but no less effective.}
<L>__{interior cathedral crypts balcony night}
<A>__{thugs dispatched, holmes and watson look down and see a chilling sight. a woman in white lies inside a crudely painted pentacle (five sided figure), lit with candles at each corner. her eyes roll back in her head, trance like. a sword has been placed at her feet. a hooded figure kneels inside a double circle next to the pentacle. this is lord blackwood. we do not yet see his face. another hooded figure stands on the edge of the ceremony, shrouded in shadow. we do not see his face. suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if pulled to her feet by invisible hands. some kind of ritual is about to climax. holmes and watson head down, fast, not caring if they make a noise or not. their footsteps echo.}
<L>__{9a interior cathedral crypts}
<A>__{the second hooded figure moves back and melts into the shadows. still kneeling, still hooded, blackwood chants softly, latin incantation repeating and repeating. on the woman as her lips start to move in time with the incantation. this is spooky, real, powerful stuff. holmes and watson leap from the stairs to blackwood's level. blackwood simply ignores them. the latin incantation never stops. holmes is closer to the girl, watson closer to blackwood.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the girl.}
<A>__{the girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to plunge the point into her heart. holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and pulls her out of the pentacle. she collapses. simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a rush of air departs the tunnel. blackwood throws back his hood. we finally see his face. his eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark and cruel. holmes and watson are shocked at his identity.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{lord blackwood?!}
<A>__{blackwood applauds softly, strangely.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{well done, holmes. and watson as well.}
<A>__{watson raises his gun, trains it on blackwood.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{stay right there.}
<A>__{blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before i'd finished the first incision.}
<A>__{that's more than watson can take. he moves in to pistol whip blackwood is stopped suddenly by holmes' hand grabbing his collar.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{watson struggles forward against holmes' grip.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{holmes seems to be pointing at blackwood. watson looks, sees nothing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide. inches from watson's right eye is the needle pointed end of a quivering piece of high tensile wire, almost invisible the other end held between blackwood's hands. a really nasty concealed weapon. one more step and watson gets impaled in the eye.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{what a shame. that would've been fun.}
<A>__{we hear heavy boots on the balcony, as lestrade and his men finally appear. policemen flood the area.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{impeccable timing, lestrade.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<P>__{(vis blackwood)}
<D>__{is that ?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(re: girl)}
<D>__{we've gone for the doctor...}
<P>__{(re: blackwood)}
<D>__{and one for the rope.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{you should've waited for my help.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if i had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the yard.}
<P>__{(a wry smile)}
<D>__{i can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance.}
<A>__{lestrade turns, frustrated. he watches his men yank blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. she's still mouthing the incantation. lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them. grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to holmes.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{what do you make of that?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{some kind of ceremony. five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon.}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{the double circle's for his own protection.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{london will breathe a sigh of relief }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{ at the excellent work of scotland yard. as usual.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{bravo, lestrade. have a cigar.}
<A>__{holmes sticks the villain's cigar in lestrade's pocket and a police photographer lifts his massive camera. flash! an explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops. the scene is frozen bright for a split second and then it fades. credit sequence begins, music and titles over }
