<L>__{exterior bridge night}
<A>__{fog obscures the east end. a sentry squints at the muffled clop of hooves. the mist parts to reveal, seventy yards away: three holnist scouts on horseback. emissaries from hell. as the sentry blows a whistle...}
<B>__{bridge}
<A>__{as word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look. eating their bread, the postman, abby and the carriers join them.}
<B>__{east end}
<A>__{the mayor stands across from the lead scout conferring. finally, the mayor points him back the way he came. the lead scout doesn't budge, spots the postman in the crowd. he and the postman seem to stare at each other forever. then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. the other two follow. swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. the postman's head swims dizzily. it's not over. the mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{they're looking for the postman.}
<C>__{b.c. man}
<D>__{no such thing anymore.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{man on the horse says there is. says he thinks he's here. says he's coming back with friends.}
<A>__{a little boy steps forward, sings out.}
<C>__{b.c. boy}
<D>__{what's a postman?}
<A>__{a silent moment. it's been so long, no one's sure how to answer. the postman looks down at the ground. the carriers exchange deflated looks. then...}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(stepping forward)}
<D>__{you never heard of a postman?}
<A>__{he shakes his head "no." seems a shame. as the postman looks over at abby, she takes a page from his book.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{there used to be a postman for every street in america. they wore uniforms. and hats. like this one...}
<A>__{she goes to the postman's gear, returns with his postal cap. sets it on the boy's head.}
<C>__{b.c. boy}
<D>__{wow...}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{my postman knew the name of every kid on my street. he knew our birthdays. he'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. i can still see the smile on his face. the tip of his cap when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. mine always came just after school. you could set your watch by him. unless you were waiting on something special like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. then it seemed like he'd never come. i used to think they could make time stand still.}
<A>__{several other listeners nod they're completely with her.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. no place was ever too far away for the postman. so nobody ever had to be alone. the postman was someone you could count on. things just made more sense when they were around.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's the kind of world we used to have. a world a lot of us took for granted. and now we've got this one. and it makes me wonder what kind of world do i want my child to live in? i want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. i want my child, and i want my friends i want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail.}
<A>__{it's a moment before anyone speaks.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<P>__{(to the postman)}
<D>__{are you the postman?}
<A>__{the postman takes the cap off the little boy's head, touches the emblem, and answers.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{i've heard of you, man. you're famous.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yeah, i guess i am. and all of a sudden, i'm not wearing the right clothes.}
<A>__{and as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well.}
