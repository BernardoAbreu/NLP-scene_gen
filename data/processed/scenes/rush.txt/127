<L>__{interior james's car day}
<A>__{james gives it everything he's got. tearing through the gears, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. the world flies past in a blur. the steering wheel shakes. the car cannot be driven any harder. no thought for safety. no thought of failure.. failure is unimaginable. unconscionable. he turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees something ahead. flags. red flags. race marshalls. something has clearly happened. an accident.. the race is being stopped. james brakes, slowing down. he pulls level with a uniformed marshall..}
