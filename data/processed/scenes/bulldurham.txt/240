<L>__{interior sandy's whorehouse night}
<A>__{nuke enters tentatively another world. grim. sleazy. the doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors. a black prostitute enters a room with a huge redneck. as they go down the hallway, and as they do: we begin hearing singing raucous, soulful, drunk. nuke stops in a doorway looks into the "waiting room". p.o.v. several hookers in various stages of undress, sit on couches and chairs. bored, smoking, ancient. the one white hooker, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar, struggling to keep up. and a couple hookers are hanging around a piano that crash is playing and singing. he doesn't look up. crash is dressed but barefoot. a cigarette dangles from his mouth as he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords. two hookers at the piano hum along.}
<C>__{crash}
<P>__{(singing and playing)}
<D>__{but when she does get weary try a little tenderness...}
<A>__{nuke steps into the room all the hookers rise in anticipation of a new customer. crash keeps playing, never looking up.}
<C>__{crash}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you know she's waiting, just anticipating, the things that she'll never possess...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{while she's there waiting try a little tenderness...}
<A>__{nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{crash. i'm going to the show.}
<A>__{crash ignores him, keeps playing.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{club's expanding its roster to finish the season }
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{shut up. i'm playing.}
<P>__{(singing last 8 bars)}
<D>__{oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it's all so easy just try a little tenderness...}
<A>__{as crash plays on }
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i'm going to the show.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{then go.}
<A>__{nuke grabs crash by the hair and jerks him to his feet. the two men are face to face.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i'm trying to thank you.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{let go of me!}
<A>__{nuke lets him go and crash staggers drunkenly against the piano, regaining his balance as: sandy rushes in with a gun to break it up.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{he makin' trouble for you, mr. davis?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{no, no, sandy, put it down.}
<P>__{(drunkenly, to nuke)}
<D>__{nuke, you know sandy grimes? hit .367 at louisville in 155.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i hit .371.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{he hit .371 c'mon, nuke you and me, let's step outside and settle this.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{settle what?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{c'mon!}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i don't wanta fight you, i wanta thank you. let's have a drink and forget this }
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{god damn it, you fucking virgin prick step outside.}
<A>__{crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear. nuke reluctantly follows.}
