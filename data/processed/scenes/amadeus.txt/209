<A>__{night 1790's we cut to : the scene immediately before papageno's song, ein madchen oder weibchen. papageno, played by schikaneder, dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through a mysterious door. a voice calls from within.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{go back!}
<A>__{papageno recoils.}
<C>__{papageno}
<D>__{merciful gods! if only i knew by which door i came in.}
<P>__{(to audience)}
<D>__{which was it? was it this one? come on, tell me!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{go back!}
<A>__{papageno recoils.}
<C>__{papageno}
<D>__{now, i can't go forward and i can't go back. oh, this is awful!}
<A>__{he weeps extravagantly. in the pit, mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor. he slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage. we follow him. over the scene we hear papageno being addressed by the first priest in stern tones.}
<C>__{first priest}
<P>__{(on stage)}
<D>__{man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth. the gentle gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the divine content of the consecrated ones.}
<C>__{papageno}
<D>__{oh well, i'm not alone in that. just give me a decent glass of wine that's divine content enough for me.}
<A>__{laughter. an enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth. we follow mozart into the wings. actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes. we see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about. also the scenery door of a temple with the word 'wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. silently mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself. on stage schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the first priest.}
<C>__{first priest}
<D>__{man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink?}
<C>__{papageno}
<P>__{(schikaneder)}
<D>__{well!}
<A>__{laughter from the audience.}
<C>__{papageno}
<D>__{well, actually i do have a rather weird feeling in my heart. perhaps it's just indigestion. but you know, i really would like i really do want something even nicer than food and drink. now what on earth could that be?}
<A>__{he stares at the audience and winks at them. they laugh. now papageno's aria (ein madchen oder weibchen) begins. it is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off stage by mozart. schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see mozart conducting. he looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement. he sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced.}
<C>__{andante}
<D>__{a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish. a willing, billing, lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish. be my most tasty little dish! be my most tasty little dish!}
<C>__{allegro}
<D>__{then that would be eating and drinking i'd live like a prince without thinking. the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine! then that would be eating and drinking! the wisdom of old would be mine a woman's much better than wine. she's much better than wine! she's much better than wine!}

<A>__{at certain moments we see the stage from salieri's point of view: schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings. then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes. he mimes again, but still nothing comes. he looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion. people are looking down on the floor. the song comes to a near halt. schikaneder stares. then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. at this moment salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.}
