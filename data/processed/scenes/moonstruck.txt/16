<D>__{i have put a curse on that plane. my sister is on that plane. i have put a curse on that plane that it should explode. burn on fire and fall into the sea. fifty years ago she stole a man from me. today she told me that she didn't even love him. she took him to feel strong with me. now she goes back to sicily. i have cursed her that the green atlantic water should swallow her up.}
