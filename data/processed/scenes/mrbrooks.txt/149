<A>__{mr. brooks' car speeds under an overpass.}
<L>__{interior mr. brooks' car n night}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{that was great! it was fantastic! it was everything i hoped it would be. thank you.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{in the back seat:}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{here comes the gun.}
<A>__{without taking his eyes off the road.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{mr. smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it at mr. brooks.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(feigns surprise)}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you're smart enough to figure that out, mr. brooks.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{well we're going sixty five miles an hour, mr. smith, if you shoot me now, there's a good chance we'll both die.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{not now. take the next off ramp.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{that wouldn't be very smart of me would it?}
<A>__{he accelerates around a truck into the fastlane. mr. smith can see the exit coming up, it's quickly left behind.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{think about this. you pissed yourself back there, you left your dna at the scene of a double homicide, and there's nothing to indicate that i was ever there. if the cops do an analysis of that urine, and they will, you're the thumbprint killer.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{no. i still have pictures of you doing the first murder.}
<A>__{mr. brooks smiles a knowing smile. beyond him on the other side of the divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes. but what were you doing at the second murder?}
<A>__{mr. smith doesn't have an answer for that.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{let me help you with a thought. you say i forced you to come along and if i'm not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the rap. now you're probably asking yourself why i would help you. i'm tired, mr. smith, i'm tired of killing. but i'm an addict, i can't quit. i've tried. i can't do it on my own. so i will let you kill me but i want you to do it smart, in a way that i disappear and my family never knows what i was.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{how do i do that?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{there's a cemetery i know about. we find an open grave, you shoot me, i fall in the grave, you shovel in just enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and i've disappeared. it's a good plan. what do you say?...}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{why should i trust you?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you don't have to trust me. you're the man holding the gun, you saw me put mine in the trunk.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i don't know. you really want me to kill you?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{okay... but any sudden moves and you're dead on the spot and i will make sure your family knows what you are.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i understand.}
