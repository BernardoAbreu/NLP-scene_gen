<A>__{the woodward forensic institute (wfi) is a 175 bed intermediate security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients. its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the department of mental health by the circuit courts of the state or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.}

<L>__{interior miranda and doug's bedroom dawn}
<A>__{push in on a sleeping couple in the dark. the alarm clock reads 5:59 am. the woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. she grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). this is miranda grey: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows.}
<L>__{interior gym swimming pool morning}
<A>__{miranda slides through the water. swimming cap on, goggles. her steady breathing takes us in and out of the water. something unsettling about this sound. something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. a person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. she emerges from the pool and self consciously wraps herself in a towel.}
<L>__{interior coffeehouse morning}
<A>__{miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.}
<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{miranda's husband douglas grey (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. he sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. a pleasant domestic scene. it's 8:00 am.}
<L>__{exterior st. anne's high school parking lot morning}
<A>__{miranda's volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. doug kisses his wife and hops out. exemplary carpoolers. students are already chatting him up as miranda drives off.}
<L>__{exterior woodward institute on a surveillance monitor}
<A>__{miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. a buzzer lets her in. as the car drives past we read the plate on the wall: "woodward forensic institute" the gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we...}
<L>__{interior woodward institute miranda's office evening}
<A>__{stark walls. simple decor. bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, chloe: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. mid session:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{this is your stepfather who came to visit you?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{my stepfather? no. he's dead.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i killed him.}
<A>__{miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's the first time you admit it.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{so? there's a first time for everything.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(jotting this down)}
<D>__{it means you're finally past the denial stage. this is good, chloe.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you only killed your stepfather as far as i know.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i should've taken care of my mother. she knew all along. you remind me of her.}
<C>__{miranda}

<D>__{let's get back to your visitor last night.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{the devil.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{alright, the devil. why would the devil visit you? it's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{he came to fuck an angel.}
<P>__{(giggles at that)}
<D>__{i'm his dirty angel.}
<A>__{before miranda can analyze that one, the room lights flicker and die. darkness. miranda's breathing speeds up.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{he grabbed me by the hair while i sucked him and usually i love that, i just do maybe you can tell me why i love it so much but not this time, he was just too rough }
<A>__{as suddenly as it went out, now the power returns. a visibly uncomfortable miranda checks the clock.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's it until monday. try and get some sleep tonight, okay?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{sure, doctor.}
<P>__{(leans in)}
<D>__{crazy people hear messages from god. not the devil. you know that, right?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i didn't say you were crazy.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you don't have to say it.}
<A>__{she almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. almost. two orderlies appear at the door. miranda nods for them to escort chloe. chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. the princess of the asylum.}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's not shrink appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're not shrink appropriate and you're about to get promoted. everybody's afraid of something.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what am i afraid of?}
<C>__{miranda}

<L>__{exterior road night}

<A>__{a bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat. she reaches for it and when she looks up we see:}
<B>__{pov through the windshield}
<A>__{a teenage girl stands smack in front of us. naked. about to get pummelled by us.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing. metal screeches as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally brakes to a halt she looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. drunk or high or in any case completely out of it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{stay on the line. don't go anywhere. the weirdest thing just }
<P>__{(the phone cuts out)}
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{she stares at the dead phone. punches the buttons on it. no go.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<A>__{she tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{were you in an accident? were you attacked? it's okay, i'm a doctor.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my name is miranda grey...}
<A>__{and now she turns. young, seventeen tops. busted lip, black eye. miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural. i'm going to get you to the hospital. okay?}
<A>__{the girl suddenly grips miranda's arm. hard.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{don't be scared. it's going to be fine.}
<A>__{now the girl is touching miranda's face. her movements desperate, smothering. like the movements of a drowning person. miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hands off me, okay? tell me your name, do you remember your name?}
<A>__{the girl tries to speak but no words come out. instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. creepy as hell. and now she is prying miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and miranda is panicking }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what are you doing? i'm trying to help you ?!}
<A>__{the girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. and as miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.}
<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{interior bedroom dawn}
<A>__{miranda wakes up in a cold sweat. just a bad dream. a beat. faint at first but growing louder, we hear a repetitive sound outside. like an echo of some sort, but vaguely familiar: thwip, thwip, thwip. miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table. except... it's not there. she turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. and now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom. she climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. trips over something. a tray that clangs loudly. her heartbeat goes haywire. she feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door. a glass pane. she peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's inside a cell. she jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hello? somebody help me!}
<L>__{exterior woodward institute establishing day}
<A>__{camera soars through the tall iron gates, past the guard. now we spot the source of our continuing thwip thwip sound: sprinklers watering the impressively kept gardens. the expansive complex is more victorian campus than drab prison, with separate wings (male and female), research units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.}
<L>__{interior woodward institute various shots}
<A>__{a bored group of female patients listen to a social worker lecturing them. a janitor mops a long corridor. patients study at the library under the watchful eye of orderlies. a doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as shelley). they force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing her tongue, prepare a syringe. institute director phil parsons at a meeting with other doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart. now we are moving up the main building's wall and through large windows into }

<A>__{pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a nurse with a cart of meds, who nods respectfully as he goes }
<L>__{interior hallway outside miranda's cell}
<A>__{an orderly unlocks the door for pete. through the glass pane he can see a visibly upset miranda arguing with the head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: irene.}

<A>__{peter forces a smile, enters }
<L>__{interior miranda's cell}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{peter, what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{pete nods at irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how do you think i feel? is this a joke?}
<A>__{peter is half listening to her, half signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in. miranda catches all of this, growing more agitated. she wears the uniform all patients wear: a white t shirt and sweats. her wedding ring is gone.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{giving you something to calm down.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't need to calm down. what i need is an explanation}
<A>__{pete grabs the meds from the nurse. irene and the attendant step closer to help. miranda feels them closing in on her. peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{just take this and we can sit down and chat.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why here, why not in my office?}
<A>__{she looks at the silent faces around her. no sympathy. or maybe too much sympathy. either way it's unnerving.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me valium.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(nods at nurse)}
<D>__{fifty milligrams.}

<P>__{(final offer)}
<D>__{twenty.}
<A>__{the nurse complies. miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we can discuss it at length after you take your meds.}
<A>__{awkward nods from irene, the nurse and the attendant. pete holds miranda's gaze. miranda takes her meds.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{okay. this better be good.}
<A>__{pete motions for the others to leave them alone. one by one they file out and lock the door behind them.}
<L>__{interior miranda's cell later}
<A>__{miranda paces. alone with pete, she is even more upset.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{miranda, this is very awkward. technically i shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. so whatever is said here won't leave this room. i won't tell parsons, i won't tell anyone.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i want to talk to my husband.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you can't to that. sit down, please. try to relax.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why would i pretend to be in any way relaxed?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i understand you're upset. but we need to put some things in order.}
<C>__{miranda}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what is this? why are you doing this to me?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{just answer the question. humor me.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hi, my name is miranda grey. i'm a psychiatrist. i transferred here to the woodward forensic institute a little over a year ago. my job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty fife }
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't mean how long you've worked here, i mean how long you've been staying here.}
<A>__{this stops her. wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm a doctor, yes? or was medical school just an elaborate dream?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{of course you're a doctor. a great doctor in fact.}
<A>__{the hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{pete, how long have i been here?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{five days.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently. that lasted three days. scans revealed left sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits.}
<A>__{miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we flashback interior neurosurgical unit miranda seizing violently from her pov: doctors struggling to contain her. arms thrashing, legs. flashes of the wall, the floor. head crashing against a cart, out of control.}

<D>__{this is the first time you speak.}
<A>__{miranda, speechless. reality sinking in.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{doug must be worried sick. i need to call him }
<A>__{pete shakes his head emphatically.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you're the most logical person i know, bar none. plus you have a photographic memory unconfirmed, but you do remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around. why am i telling you this?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're establishing my personality as fairly intellectual, you don't consider me impulsive or emotional.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{and that's a fair assessment, no?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{yes, that's fair. and following this pattern of analysis, we're about to discuss a traumatic event that rendered this psychological profile useless, correct?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{two hundred percent.}
<A>__{a pause here. he's waiting for her to continue. she's not used to being on the other side of the therapist's table.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you think i'm in denial. that i'm putting on a brave show that this is a 'cover' for some unbearable emotion i'm hiding. why?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't analyze yourself, just focus on remembering.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i remember friday night after work, if you say that was five days ago }
<P>__{(pushing on)}
<D>__{anyway, i asked you what you were doing for the weekend and you said the usual and you made a joke about writing country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and i told you i was going to look at some real estate in willows creek with doug.}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{there was indeed an accident, you were detoured by the cops. but there's no report of any girl.}

<D>__{how did you get this?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{chloe did. who knows how? not me. around here i'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff i don't need to know. my point is about people talking behind other people's backs. like before i was here, everything i did i thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back. but now i'm more anonymous, more myself. i'm shelley.}

<A>__{miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower. something vaguely concentration camp like about institutional bathing. the shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn. miranda feels chloe's gaze on her across the room. she is stripping off her clothes for miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the stones' "start me up."}

<L>__{interior communal showers later}
<A>__{miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. the sounds slowly fade out : until all we have is miranda and her ragged breathing. chloe and shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. chloe winks at miranda when she catches her staring, but miranda is not staring at her. she is staring past her at the tile wall. more specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. push into the hole to see a perfectly formed globule of blood emerge, following by a gurgling sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. the blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. the gurgling grows louder, closer, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. panic. shuts her eyes.}

<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{it isn't real. it isn't real.}

<D>__{it isn't real. you're hallucinating.}
<A>__{perhaps. but now blood drips by her ankle, drip, drip, drip. and the shooting pain she feels is coming from her arm. what the hell ? we see sharp slashes appearing on her skin, like some invisible knife is slicing her. hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers }
<L>__{interior locker room dressing area}
<A>__{miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything. fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{can you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall?}

<D>__{enough privacy for you?}

<D>__{you saw it?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{listen, doctor. some people, they have a gift. and in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that. it's like that hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago? it's like that. doesn't mean you're crazy. it only means your eyes open in a different way.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me this before?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. my job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're changing the subject.}

<D>__{no, you're not. you're a close minded academic, just like me. you told me once that i was the most logical person you knew, remember? well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. rachel parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago tossed off the ashley bridge by my husband. my harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband that's how pathetically blind i've been.}

<D>__{that's not true. you have less than a year left here.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{that's a lie! i will never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. no wonder you doctors can't help anyone all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing!}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. but i know you, chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. and you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. it's up to you.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{it was you, wasn't it?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}

<A>__{miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off. her hand starts to shake. sheriff ryan turns and strides off. getting away. further. further... but as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to do it. finally brings the gun down. the armed policemen rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff her.}

<A>__{miranda's eyes snap open at the sound of deadbolts sliding unlocked. hopeful. could this be rachel? a looming figure appears at the door. doesn't bother to shut it. stares at her silently for a long while. and so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:}

<D>__{how did you know?}

<D>__{you tell me.}

<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you think me and doug are monsters. that this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. but it wasn't that at all. you do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. life goes on.}

<D>__{no, that's what you want me to do.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{back to profiling, huh? your thought process is completely transparent.}
<A>__{and now miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation. analyst and patient in session. echoing her opening scene with chloe.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{so we're even. you left that door open so i'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{i guess we'll find out.}

<D>__{trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything.}

<D>__{take it off.}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's for show. you know you can't shoot me.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{but i can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.}

<A>__{miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. takes quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage area with barred windows. she makes a turn up ahead and reaches another gate down the corridor. a sliding gate that closes off the cell area from the main station. she tries the gate. locked, naturally. she shakes and bangs on it, desperate.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{turlington!! somebody help me!!}

<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{i'm not saying they knew they were going to die, but truth is, doug and i didn't know it was going to end that way. it was just the natural extension of that moment. so yeah, we fucked them and we killed them. and we knew it was wrong. sure we did.}
<A>__{he reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a clanging sound. miranda wasn't underneath that one. she scrambles to the door behind him as he turns }
<L>__{interior hallway to cell area continuous action}
<A>__{she slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly smashes open against her, knocking her backwards onto the floor he looms over her. she reaches around for anything to defend herself. nothing there. game over }

<D>__{it wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it. but i believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell you what, keep the shirt. the bra will do.}
<A>__{miranda stares, helpless. the sheriff gestures for her to begin. like he has all the time in the world. miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt. petrified }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{chin up, doctor. you wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did. you followed it all the way through. this is how it ends.}
<A>__{his demeanor and voice are eerily calm, as if in a trance. he takes the bra from her hand and hangs it around her neck, as if helping somebody with their tie. she takes a step back and finds herself pinned against the wall }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{doug settled down once you two got married. new start and all that. wanted nothing to do with this runaway i'd found, tracy seaver }

<D>__{you can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life.}

<D>__{the only soul you can ever count on is yourself }
<A>__{blam! a gunshot rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. he stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. he looks up at miranda with the gun trained on him. struggling to catch her breath. a faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{why, doctor. that was unexpected.}
<A>__{he steps forward, almost playfully. she slowly shakes her head. wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you sure about this?}

<D>__{dear pete. hope this finds you on both feet, preferably having been promoted to director after phil's retirement. not that you had much competition, but a big hug to you anyway... i was as surprised as anyone to read about sheriff ryan's suicide and the startling discovery that it was he who murdered my late husband. i wish i could personally thank certain people for their convincing testimonies in the case.}

<A>__{still pulling back through the lush cemetery, past several trees until we find rachel watching the serene scene. she turns to camera now and we push into her eyes, finally at peace, until it fills the screen and in it we see...}
