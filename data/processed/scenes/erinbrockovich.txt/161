<L>__{exterior hinkley gas station sunset}
<A>__{erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the bottle. she checks her watch: 6:30. the gas station attendant comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{this is the only station in town, right?}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{he gets in his car and drives off. erin sits down again. looks down the road in both directions. nothing. then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint of chrome. she shields her eyes against the sunset and sees: the beat up truck parked behind some shrubbery. erin looks around, realizes she's alone. as she looks back at the truck, the ash of a cigarette brightens in the cab. she realizes she's being watched. the driver's door opens. erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys. she jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it won't turn over. panic. the man in the dark glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car. erin looks around again. not a soul. she tries the engine again. and again. just as he gets to her car, the engine engages. erin peels out of the gas station.}
