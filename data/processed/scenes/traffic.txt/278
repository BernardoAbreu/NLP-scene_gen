<D>__{big day.}
<P>__{(shows picture in paper)}
<D>__{you're a star.}

<A>__{ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast.}
<C>__{ruiz}
<D>__{can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened? that my drugs had gone through. what would have been the harm? a few people get high who are getting high anyway. your partner is still alive. we avoid having breakfast together. don't you see this means nothing? that your whole life is pointless?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you're breaking my heart.}
<C>__{ruiz}

<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{so go shower already.}
