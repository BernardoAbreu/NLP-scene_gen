<L>__{exterior screening room, paramount studios later}
<A>__{shurlock exits and approaches hitchcock who's waiting in the foyer.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{you're going to have to cut all that nudity.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{what nudity? it was suggested.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{i definitely saw that knife jabbing her.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{we did no such shot.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{i'd stake my reputation on it. i'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely.}
<A>__{hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i will go over it frame by frame and set up another screening.}
<A>__{but shurlock is already walking away... wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with balaban. hitch searches their expressions for some indication but balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{what's the verdict?}
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<D>__{let's just say it was a four letter review and it wasn't `good'.}
<A>__{the harsh reality devastates hitchcock.}
<C>__{lew wasserman }
<D>__{screw him. it's too late for paramount to back out no matter what balaban says.}
<A>__{hitch just stands there.}
<C>__{lew wasserman }
<D>__{the other route is to recut it as a two parter for the tv series. because of the budget and the hitchcock name, we stand a good chance of breaking even.}
<A>__{still, hitch doesn't say a word.}
<C>__{lew wasserman }
<D>__{look, i made jimmy stewart a millionaire of winchester 73 and that was a dog. at least i could sit through your picture.}
<A>__{hitch stares bleakly off. he can't help noticing the kim novak type he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and kissing her date.}
<C>__{lew wasserman }
<D>__{more importantly, what does alma think?}
