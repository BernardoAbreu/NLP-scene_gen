<L>__{interior milo's yacht cabin same time}
<A>__{the payoff is in progress. one of milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the wall. places it on a built in counter. underneath the suitcase is a half finished jigsaw puzzle. off to one side is a half empty coffee container. the case is opened. greenbacks galore. baynard's aide whistles softly. examines the stacks of bills. nods, satisfied.}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{okay. we're cool.}
<A>__{just then milo enters the cabin. adopts a harsh new york accent as he angrily barks:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hey! any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah?}
<C>__{crewman}
<D>__{no, sir, we didn't think }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{exactly, you didn't think! goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy!}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{hey, baby, i'm clean, take it easy }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{fuck easy. against the wall, spread 'em!}
<A>__{as baynard's man assumes the position milo hits a concealed button. it happen in less than a second: the built in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter. identical half finished jigsaw puzzle. identical coffee cup. and, of course, the identical suitcase. the indignant aide turns around, pat down concluded.}

<D>__{okay? satisfied?}
<A>__{milo smiles apologetically.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we're cool, baby.}
<A>__{he hands over the suitcase.}
<B>__{back topside}
<A>__{baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. steps over the rail, crossing to the senator's boat. gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. they cast off the lines. freeing the two boats.}
