<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{a hundred horses...five or six wagons... and about six thousand fools.}
<A>__{two cavalry officers gallop into view, raising a plume of dust. then an enormous army appears: cavalry, foot soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears, raised banners. the two officers shout orders over the thunderous clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor. charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through the crossroads. willow holds the baby. fighting dust and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{sir? sir!}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{out of the way!}
<A>__{an officer's horse nearly kicks willow, who scurries out of the way. huddling with the baby, he notices airk thaughbaer, a large, muscular, bearded officer, clearly in charge. on horseback, airk breaks file and rides up to the other officers.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{push 'em harder! no rest at mid day! we need to make ten more leagues by dark!}
<A>__{shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the front and rear of the army. airk watches the army pass. willow desperately scrambles up to him.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{sir! sir! i have this baby. we found her in our village. will you take her...?}
<A>__{huge airk looks down from his huge horse. little wil low holds up the baby.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{we're going into battle, little one. find a woman to take care of it.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{he thought you were a woman, airk!}
<A>__{airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{madmartigan! what did you do this time?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!}
<A>__{airk's horse prances menacingly around madmartigan's cage.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{i always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{least i'm not down there herding sheep!}
<A>__{airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{you're lucky somebody got to you first, madmartigan! i'd've killed you myself after that stunt at land's end!}
<A>__{he swings that cage and starts to ride away.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{airk! come on, airk. lemme outa here.}
<C>__{airk}
<P>__{(really sarcastic)}
<D>__{hey, remember? you don't need my help, madmartigan. little rabbit trap like this? come on! i could open it for you, but i wouldn't wanna insult you!}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{gimme a sword, airk. i will win your war for you.}
<A>__{airk quickly drops the banter and glares at madmartigan seri ously.}
<C>__{airk}
<D>__{you're nothing but trouble, madmar tigan. and i got plenty of that. stay in your coffin and rot!}
<A>__{airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges off.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i will be around long after you're dead, airk! you slime! when i get outa here i will cut your head off and stick it on a pig pole!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<A>__{madmartigan snarls down at willow as the army continues to march by. but then he quickly gets cute again.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{hello, little baby...}
