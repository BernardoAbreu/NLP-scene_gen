<L>__{interior gideon young's office evening rush hour, est}
<A>__{director grace already sits in front of young's desk.}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{good afternoon, sir.}
<A>__{young says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears his throat still no eye contact reads aloud like a poor man's orson welles:}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{`sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant.}
<C>__{gideon young }
<D>__{in that spirit i come before this judiciary committee with a painful admission.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{simply: i've lost all confidence in the fbi, especially it's uppermost echelon. entrenched and outmoded, the leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering thought this committee and i have tried to imbue. it is thus an agency at contretemps, hindering our every effort.' and by `committee' i mean the fucking senate select committee on terror...}
<A>__{young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like fear, remorse, back pedalling...}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{senators? then i'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in god's name is `contretemps?' these guys aren't the best and brightest }
<A>__{young's face flashes red, seething:}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{ never take the lord's name in vain in this office }
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{ but you can say `fucking?'}
<A>__{young apoplectic now: ready to end the director right there, when grace leans in, lets the vague threat of physical contact manifest.}
<C>__{director grace }
<D>__{you're going to the senate select committee, but not to the president who appointed you. why's that?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i bet the president wasn't the audience you thought he'd be: i will bet he realized you can't have voters asking why the second longest serving fbi director gets fired for doing his job, for sending agents into saudi arabia, seven months from mid term elections }
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{ you really want to bet?}
<A>__{grace snaps his id badge off his lapel, puts it on the table.}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{young's pallor tells us his bluff has been called. goes silent. grace smells it, finishes him now:}
<C>__{director grace }
<D>__{westmoreland made all us officers write our own obituaries during tet, when it looked like the cong were going to end it all right there. once we clued in that life was finite, the loss of it no longer scared us: the end comes no matter what, it's just a question of how you want to go out: on your feet or on your knees. after that, we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted. and vietnam lasted another seven years.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the lesson extends to this career: i act, knowing the end of this job will come, no matter what. you should do the same.}
<A>__{grace waits: nothing else from young. stands, snaps his id badge back on his lapel, walks out.}
<C>__{director grace }
<D>__{i will forward fleury's reports.}
