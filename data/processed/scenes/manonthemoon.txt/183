<A>__{andy sits disoriented in the living room. movers bustle around him. mirrors get leaned against opposing walls and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself. in the b.g., lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out. andy opens a box and pulls out his old howdy doody doll. he smiles, then places howdy on the shelf next to the vases. suddenly a phone on the floor rings. he grins.}

<D>__{hey! our first phone call!}
<P>__{(he scrambles for the phone)}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{andy... it's me. i've got some crummy news.}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{taxi's been canceled.}
<A>__{silence. andy has no response.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont'd) do you want me to come over? talk about it?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{um... no. uh, i'm sorta busy right now. thanks. we'll get together next week.}
<A>__{andy hangs up. he just sits there... confused... unsure how to react. andy scratches his head then feels something odd. he goes over to the mirror. on the back of his neck... is an inflamed red pimple. andy grimaces.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{yuck!}
