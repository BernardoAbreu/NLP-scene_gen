<L>__{interior kinograph studios george's dressing room day}
<D>__{we're back with george in his dressing room. he's removing his make up. he moves some ordinary object and the object, as he moves it, makes a noise. we hear the noise it makes. really hear it. it's the first time we've heard a sound that comes from within the film itself. one second later, george realizes that the object made a noise. he moves it again, the object makes a noise again. george is worried. he tries another object and obtains noise again. his dog barks and we hear it! he gets up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. he realizes this... panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking again, but still no sound comes out. not understanding what's happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his dressing room!}
