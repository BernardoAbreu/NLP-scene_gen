<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{a close shot of a yellow legal tablet. a young hand comes into frame, holding a pencil. for a few moments, we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written in a series of dissolves. the hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way. and then the sound of an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we now hear alvin and the chipmunks' "christmas song."}
<L>__{exterior pacific ocean day}
<A>__{a lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky. behind it, the sparkling blue of the pacific ocean and the city of san diego. a dry, hot southern california day. even the wind is lazy, and a little bored.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood shopping center day}
<A>__{santa claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he collects for the salvation army. this is christmas in the southland. no snow, no winter wonderland. just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues. turning the corner, walking into frame is elaine miller, 35. she is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's having with her pale young son william, late pre teens. they stand apart from the other shoppers. all around them is the highly charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering fake christmas trees. she hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual conversation, when something stops her. a workman is affixing letters to a store front. he has already placed the merry... now he's finishing the xmas. elaine is strong, but always pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{excuse me, i'm a teacher. there is no word in the english language "xmas." it's either merry christmas... or happy holidays.}
<A>__{the workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as mom turns away. the workman shares a look with william, who shrugs that's my mom. title: 1969}
<L>__{exterior mini tract condo complex day}
<A>__{this is the new professional class. it's a mini condo community. rows of spanish styled three bedroom houses with common walls. move in on one of these homes, the one without christmas lights. at the door is a furtive 15 year old girl. she checks her cheek, straightens her hair. she hides something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance to enter. music fades.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{we now hear the dialogue between this lively mother and her son, as she cooks a pan full of soy based health food cutlets. the meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan. across the kitchen we see william. he's a great listener, with a calm and curious face that takes everything in.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ so livia }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ killed everyone off so her son tiberius could inherit the throne.}
<P>__{(thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{just like nixon.}
<A>__{william nods, intrigued. he has a good disposition. the world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings out in his mom. there is a small clatter at the front door, as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes. she silently curses herself.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{anita, is that you?}
<C>__{anita's voice}
<D>__{hey mom! i already ate.}
<A>__{mom moves to the living room to greet william's sister. william peers into the next room.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{she's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches her. we now discover anita, 16, up close. she is an alluring young natalie wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you sure? i'm making soy cutlets.}
<A>__{the words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i'm fine. already ate.}
<A>__{william stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as mom moves closer to his sister. she sees something curious about her daughter.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{wait. you've been kissing.}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(too quickly)}
<D>__{no i haven't.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(peering at her lips)}
<D>__{yes... yes, you have...}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{no i haven't.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{yes you have. i can tell.}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(boldly)}
<D>__{you can't tell.}
<A>__{mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully. to her, everything is a quest for knowledge.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{not only can i tell , i know who it is. it's darryl.}
<A>__{anita is stunned silent. she turns slightly to look at herself in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself immediately.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{and what have you got under your coat?}
<A>__{this is the booty anita didn't want to give up. mom picks at the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket. she withdraws the album. it's simon and garfunkel's bookends.}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(busted)}
<D>__{it's unfair that we can't listen to our music!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(weary of the issue)}
<D>__{honey, it's all about drugs and promiscuous sex.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{simon and garfunkel is poetry!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{yes it's poetry. it's the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex.}
<A>__{look at}
<D>__{the picture on the cover...}
<B>__{close on bookends album cover}
<A>__{mom's fingers at the edges. we examine the insolent faces on richard avedon's classic album cover. even simon and garfunkle look guilty under her scholarly inspection.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{... honey, they're on pot.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{first it was butter, then sugar and white flour.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{bacon. eggs, bologna, rock and roll, motorcycles.}
<A>__{nearby, william squirms as he watches the gently escalating conversation. anita glances at her brother. he silently urges her to downshift. she can't.}
<C>__{anita }
<D>__{then it was celebrating christmas on a day in september when you knew it wouldn't be "commercialized."}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that was an experiment. but i understand }
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{what else are you going to ban?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{honey, you want to rebel against knowledge.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{i'm trying to give you the cliff's notes on how to live in this world.}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(simple and direct)}
<D>__{we're like nobody else i know.}
<A>__{these are the words that sting mom most.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'm a teacher. why can't i teach my own kids?}
<P>__{(pats chest) use me.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down. he says i'm a "yes" person and you're trying to raise us in a "no" environment!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(immediately, can't help it)}
<D>__{well, clearly, "no" is a word darryl doesn't hear much.}
<A>__{anita gasps. ever the peacemaker, william weighs in. nearby is a poster "no more war."}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{mom }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{everything i say is wrong.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i can't live here! i hate you! even william hates you!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't hate her.}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(to william)}
<D>__{you don't even know the truth!}
<A>__{william looks vaguely confused.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.}
<A>__{anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the strangled sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for the first time.}
<D>__{anita feck}
<A>__{you! all of you!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{anita runs down the hall to her room. elaine turns to william, relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{well, there it is. your sister using the "f" word.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i think she said "feck."}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(sputtering) what's the difference?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(encouraging)}
<D>__{well. the letter "u"...}
<A>__{shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of the moody blues' "nights in white satin."}
<L>__{interior school dance gymnasium bathroom night}
<A>__{music continues. shot moves along a row of very mature looking male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror. there's the kid with a very mature looking moustache, the kid proudly sporting full blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some hai karate ), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down, down to find william. he is so much younger, without a zit in sight. puberty is so very distant on his horizon.}
<L>__{interior dance night under cranked}
<A>__{song continues as we see william's perspective of these much older looking kids. girls now are visible, and they are even more mature than the boys we've just seen. they flirt and glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys. whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down. it's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{are you really in our grade?}
<L>__{interior junior high locker room day}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{are you really in our grade?}
<A>__{william turns to see tall, adenoidal tim tobin. the most mature looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges william in a loud theatrical tone. it is a voice right out of guys and dolls, which incidentally is the school play in which tobin had just starred. william answers in a respectful voice. he is desperate for acceptance.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tobin}
<D>__{hey guys! check it out! william doesn't have any pubes !}
<A>__{others now begin to gather around, examining william. he has never been more naked.}
<D>__{guy # 1 how old are you man?}
<C>__{tobin}
<D>__{he's not a man, he's a little baby kid. he doesn't even get zits yet. guy # 2 how come you don't have any hair down there?}
<C>__{tobin}
<P>__{(in loud, funny voice) where are your pubes???!!}
<A>__{their voices echo off the tiled walls. now everyone is watching the hairless william. he is confused by their meanness.}
<D>__{guy # 2 yeah. where are your pubes?}
<A>__{all eyes are on him, waiting for a response. the kid's mental wheels turn frantically. and from somewhere comes an attitude, a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could only be a merciful deity.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(cool, dismissive)}
<D>__{i had 'em. i shaved 'em off.}
<A>__{it is a new persona for the kid the witty guy. and it works. guy #2 cracks up, then others. william's new accuser is suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these older boys. others turn away, on to other things. tobin stares at william, and then also turns away.}
<L>__{interior family car day}
<A>__{william jumps into the backseat of the white ford country sedan station wagon, carrying books. ("see ya pubes!") mom continues driving william and anita home from school.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(cheerfully, by rote, to william in back)}
<D>__{put on your seatbelt. i don't want you flying through the windshield.}
<A>__{anita examines her own un fastened seatbelt, which mom hasn't noticed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{we got our annuals today }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(cheerful, automatic)}
<D>__{"received" your annual.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(looking at his photo)}
<D>__{i look so much younger than everyone else.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{enjoy it while you can.}
<A>__{camera drifts from mom to anita, who can take it no longer.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{mom. it's time.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(pleasant, pointed)}
<D>__{can this wait until we get home?}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{mom, pull over.}
<A>__{tell him the truth. tell him how old he is. mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(as in "be quiet")}
<D>__{he knows how old he is.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{the other kids make fun of him because of how young he looks. nobody includes him.}
<A>__{they call him "the narc" behind his back...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they do?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what's a "narc?"}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(bleeding for her brother) a narcotics officer!}
<D>__{elaine well what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(ever the peacemaker)}
<D>__{come on you guys. it's no big deal. i'm 12. it's okay. she skipped me a grade, it's okay. big deal. i'm a year younger. they're 13, i'm 12 }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't i?}
<A>__{their silence is eloquent.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(confessing, in a rush)}
<D>__{i also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{so... i'm... how old?}
<A>__{a heavy quiet. she and his sister ignore him, as they now debate the subject with each other.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you lied to him! you make such a big deal about the truth and you lied!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(that one hurts)}
<D>__{he never asked.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{what like he's going to ask if he's as old as he thinks he is? don't you realize, this is going to scar him forever?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{honey... sweetheart... don't be cleopatra. we have to be his mother and his dad.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you put too much pressure on him!}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(apprehensive)}
<D>__{how... old...}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{and when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{... am i?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{i skipped you an extra grade. you're eleven.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(horrified, voice crackling) eleven?}
<A>__{he looks at his body, the information affects him physically. new sounds come from way down deep inside. mom now begins speed rapping, trying to stem the leak. she starts the car.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{so you skipped fifth grade. there's too much padding in the grades. i taught elementary school. 5th grade unnecessary. nothing happens in the 5th grade. all teachers know it, no one talks about it.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(still in shock)}
<D>__{e leven.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{and you skipped kindergarten because i taught it to you when you were four.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(still horrified, looking at his body)}
<D>__{this explains... so much...}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you've robbed him of an adolescence!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{adolescence is a marketing tool.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{he's got no "crowd"... no friends...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{anita reaches out to her brother. with the compassion of a saint, she offers this:}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{honey, i know you were expecting puberty. you're just going to have to shine it on for a while.}
<A>__{deeply embarrassed, william shrinks down in the seat. mom monitors his face constantly. she is raw and sincere... and yes, inspiring:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{who needs a "crowd?" you're unique. you're two years ahead of everybody. take those extra years and do what you want. go to europe for a year! take a look around, see what you like! follow your dream! you'll still be the youngest lawyer in the country. your own great grandfather practiced law until he was 93. your dad was so proud of you. he knew you were a pronominally accelerated child.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(heartbroken, can't help herself)}
<D>__{you're rebellious and ungrateful of my love.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{well, somebody's gotta be normal around here!}

<P>__{(blinking, still can't}
<D>__{believe it) eleven.}
<L>__{interior william's bedroom day}
<A>__{william finishes the last of many candy bars. a mound of wrappers sit just below the mirror. he examines his face hopefully for zits. nothing coming. we begin to hear simon and garfunkel's "america."}

<A>__{anita stands in the living room. the song continues playing on the stereo.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i want to play you a song that explains why i'm leaving, and try to listen.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{we can't talk? we have to listen to rock music?}
<L>__{exterior front lawn day}
<A>__{william watches sadly. anita's good looking boyfriend darryl, a dead ringer for young stephen stills, loads her suitcases into a large turqouise chevy. the suitcases are adorned with plastic stick on flowers. all coolness is leaving william's life. mom watches nearby, worried and helpless. (their house is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{take good care of her in san francisco, man.}
<A>__{darryl gives the kid a sub human look. he's invisible, too young to converse with.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how can she leave such a loving family?}
<A>__{anita turns and heads towards them. she focuses on william, placing her hands on his young shoulders. her face is very close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the future.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{one day you'll be cool.}
<A>__{he nods stoically, hopefully. he is utterly lost. she leans forward and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{anita }
<D>__{look under your bed. it'll set you free.}
<A>__{anita shakes hands with mom, and exits. as the car takes off:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she'll be back.}
<A>__{in the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{yeahhhhh hoooooooo.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{maybe not soon...}
<A>__{william watches wistfully. he moves away from his mother. she pulls him closer. shot moves in on his slightly fearful face.}
<L>__{interior darryl's car day}
<A>__{anita looks back at the receding american gothic image of her mother and brother. sister waves to brother. she feels for him. music now shifts to the who's "sparks."}
<L>__{interior bedrooom night}
<A>__{william locks the door. he reaches under his bed. it's a black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design. he unzips the bag it's filled with albums. he flips through the amazing, subversive cache of music. cream's wheels of fire... the seminal bob dylan bootleg great white wonder... the rolling stones' get yer ya ya's out... the beach boys' pet sounds... abraxas by santana... jethro tull's stand up... the mother's of invention's we're only in it for the money... led zeppelin... crosby, stills and nash... miles davis' bitches brew... and the who's tommy... with a note taped to it.}

<B>__{close on photos in magazine}
<A>__{camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and fashions of the rock heroes of the day. ian anderson of jethro tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute. neil young, enigmatic with perfectly patched levis. the southern rock royalty of the allman brothers band, posing and laughing in front of massive stacks of amps. marc bolan of t. rex, his ringlet hair backlit by stage lights. david bowie in skin tight japanese one piece attire, onstage with the spiders from mars. pete townsend of the who, slashing windmill style at his guitar. drift down to a by line by lester bangs.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{william walks through the parking lot after school. everybody now congregates around the new arrival of their lives their own cars. arms suddenly clap william on the back, friendly faces smile strangely, laughing. he takes a few steps and looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing something from the high school marquee. high school marquee which reads: william miller is too young to drive (or fuck) all are laughing. he laughs with them, and turns as his face goes slack. he shrugs, marches on.}
<L>__{exterior downtown san diego radio station day}
<A>__{the song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by a highly active man in a red promotional t shirt proclaiming the greatness of the guess who. he is a ferocious, lumbering, music driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the very brim. this is lester bangs, 25, the rarely seen god of a then new art form rock journalism. a disc jockey with long long hair watches helplessly. william views all this through a glass window. he stands on the corner of a downtown side street, halfway up a steep incline. he is the only person on the streets this early saturday morning. reveal that he is watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small p.a. speaker overhead.}

<A>__{william watches intently. bangs thuds the needle onto a copy of raw power. we're rewarded with a blast of iggy and the stooges' "search and destroy." a closer shot on william now watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside. lester does an iggy pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the other side of this double glass window.}
<L>__{exterior radio station day later}
<A>__{bangs walks with william on this sharply inclined san diego street. it's early, the streets are silent. bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight. his jeans are loose, his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing. in there somewhere is a good looking guy. his hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he takes big sweeping steps.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{so you're the one who's been sending me those articles from your school newspaper }
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i've been doing some stuff for a local underground paper, too.}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{over?}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{well. at least i'm here for that.}
<A>__{bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head. it's too late for newcomers. but if the kid's age is an issue, he doesn't mention it. like a machine gun:}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{what do you type on?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{smith corona galaxis deluxe.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{you like the new lou reed?}

<D>__{smart kid. i used to do speed and sometimes nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the guess who, or coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting... william me too.}
<A>__{the writing part... for a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens. bangs laughs. it's an odd and charming laugh, the kind a tough guy keeps well hidden. it surprised the kid, who smiles back. bangs stops at the corner, and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{well, alright. it's been nice to meet you. i will see you around. keep sending me your stuff.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay. see you.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{i can't stand here all day talking to my many fans.}

<A>__{because once you go}
<D>__{to l.a., you're gonna have friends like crazy but they'll be fake friends, they're gonna try to corrupt you. the publicists! the bands! you got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything.}
<A>__{but you cannot make friends}

<D>__{that's what's important. if you're a rock journalist, a true journalist first you will never get paid much. but you will get free records from the record company.}
<A>__{the kid's eyes widen. bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{and they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls... they'll try to fly you places for free.... offer you drugs... i know. it sounds great. but they are not your friends.}
<A>__{these are people who want you}
<D>__{to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it.}
<A>__{privately, william thrills. we. our. it all sounds great to him. he listens to the grouping of the words, every one of them. he madly scribbles.}
<C>__{bangs }

<A>__{the kid leans forward as lester finds the right word.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{ dumb!}
<A>__{and you're smart enough to}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{... industry... of... cool...}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{and that's what they want!}
<A>__{and it's}
<D>__{happening right now. i'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll. the war is over. they won. 99% of what passes for rock now... silence is much more compelling. it's over. i think you should turn around and go back and be... a lawyer or something... but i can see from your face that you won't. i can pay you thirty five bucks. gimme a thousand words on black sabbath.}

<D>__{and if you get into a jam call me. i stay up late.}
<A>__{bangs reaches across the table, and william watches as he scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate notebook. the notebook has just become valuable. they sit together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.}

<D>__{okay. okay. i could do that.}
<C>__{jeff}

<D>__{yeah, come back here!! keep going!}

<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{dressing room activity swirls around him, as william simply listens. he holds a small microphone. his stoic look gives away little of the full body rush he's experiencing. as the other band members drift across frame, russell hammond, a true rock and roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready for the show. to the kid, every word is reckless gem.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{... and it's okay, because rock and roll is a lifestyle... and a way of thinking and it's not about money and "popularity!"}

<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but we didn't do it for that! we are here because we needed to fuckin be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from troy, michigan, which we did... but what it all comes down to is that thing. the indefinable thing, when people catch something from your music, the thing you put into it. i'm talking about... what am i talking about?}

<P>__{(elegantly)}
<D>__{the buzz?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{the buzz! and the chicks, the whatever, is an off shoot of the buzz. and like you saying you liked "fever dog?" that is the fucking buzz, man. all we get are these fucking old ass interviewers who don't understand, don't listen, don't appreciate why we are here, which is the fuckin' buzz.}
<A>__{william nods, holds his microphone steady. russell tunes his guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks. jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{the next album will be even better. more texture.}
<C>__{russell}

<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(he does it)}
<D>__{that's what you remember. the silly things, the little things... there's only one, and it makes the song. it's what you leave out. that's rock and roll.}

(adlib onstage private patter, between members, goading each other the stuff no audience ever hears) twenty feet away, dick prepares to address the crowd from the darkened stage. it is his favorite moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.}

<A>__{miss penny lane's yellow vega makes the big swing onto sunset boulevard. she sings along to the obscure words of led zeppelin's "dancing days." william takes it all in from the passenger seat. huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or beer, but albums. it's a wondrous piece of geography for any rock fan. shot moves in as william, watches, takes it all in. he moves his head outside the window to see fully. her windshield is cracked along the side.}

<L>__{interior hyatt house lobby night}
<A>__{penny blasts into the continental hyatt house, william on her arm. the lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive than most clubs. it's a swirling mass of roadies carrying halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling rockers, and more than a few groupies with lower ambitions and taller platforms than penny lane. the feeling is communal, illicit, intoxicating. the secret community of rock. penny attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.}

<A>__{stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone in this room. russell takes a seat near the open mike. jeff bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be just as close to the microphone as russell. william watches all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth. stillwater sits with late night progressive disc jockey quince allen, 25. quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it. the entire stillwater band is now collected in the studio and ready for the interview. william can't avoid looking at penny lane, who looks great tonight. she catches him, and he barely looks away in time. polexia, newly reconciled with jeff, notices. the very mellow disc jockey eases up to the microphone, as the finale of "fever dog" is just ending.}

<D>__{well... not to get into a "me" thing... this is jeff talking... but i did start the band, some time, actually, ago. this is back when we were the jeff bebe band, and i placed an ad in a magazine called peaches looking for a guitarist and russell hammond answered.}

<C>__{russell }
<D>__{okay we're talking now, right? why the fuck do you wait until and interview in arizona to say something nice about me. why don't you say it to my fucking face sometime? because i tell you every time i think you nailed something.}

<D>__{you should be really proud of him. 'cause i know guys... and i will bet you do too. and he respects women, and he likes women, and let's just pause and appreciate a man like that. you created him out of thin air, and you raised him right, and we're all looking out for him. and that's more than i've ever said to my own parents, so there you go.}

<P>__{(very professional)}
<D>__{now that you're starting to be successful, you had twenty six years to write your first album... and you'll have maybe four months for the second. do you worry that the pressure of the business will get in the way of the original joy of making your music? or }

<A>__{russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with william. william follows him through the sliding glass door to his room, facing the pool. russell grabs his guitar. they stand for a moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait twenty yards in front of them. the off limits after hours pool area has been overtaken by the stillwater tour members. jeff bebe sits in a chair nearby. dick laughs at a joke. always the life of the party, penny lane dispenses stolen towels from a maid cart. and she is the first to slip into the pool for some after hours, against the rules swimming. effortlessly, she turns a collection of people into a party. they regard her, well out of earshot of the others.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{for a minute i thought you were actually a real journalist... which is... you know, it's great.}

<A>__{they both watch penny lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool. she places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{like you.}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. right.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{so your question you asked me. i think about it every fucking night. the "business." i hate it!}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i grew up with these guys, okay? i can't play all that i can play, i'm past these musicians, do you understand?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{the more popular we get, the more i can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure... you forget, man. you forget what it was like to be real, to be a fan.}
<A>__{you can}
<D>__{hear it in a lot of bands who've been successful it doesn't sound like music anymore. it sounds like... like lifestyle maintenance.}
<P>__{(suddenly confessional)}
<D>__{i used to be able to hear the sounds of the world. everything, to me, used to sound like music. everything. now i don't hear it. you know what i'm trying to say?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{man, it feels good to say this stuff out loud. but what am i doing? i'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(feeling included)}
<D>__{no, that's okay. we'll do the interview tomorrow.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{this is good. so there's the "friend" and then there's the "interview guy."}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{so tonight it's "friend".... and when we wake up tomorrow " interview guy. " we'll figure it out as we go, buddy.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hey for whatever it's worth you guys are really good.}
<A>__{russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete. he hands his guitar to the kid, and joins the party. william watches, part of the crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised. he doesn't care. penny gestures for him to join them.}
<L>__{exterior sun stadium afternoon}
<A>__{william interviews larry in the seats of the empty arena. on stage, ed soundchecks his drums.}

<D>__{i'm the bass player.}

<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{the bass?}
<A>__{larry doesn't give him much.}
<L>__{exterior sun stadium night}
<A>__{it's raining. the pre show huddle breaks up, william a part of them. penny lane adjusts larry's look. she takes the scarf from around his neck and ties it around his leg. he looks instantly better. william watches in the darkness as dick takes the microphone. the best part of his day has arrived. in his important voice:}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{good evening phoenix.}
<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{from troy, michigan. please welcome, stillwater.}
<A>__{lights come up, as the band launches into "fever dog." jeff begins singing. russell reaches to adjust the microphone for a back up vocal and is hit with something unexpected. a sharp electrical shock. it's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a moment something is clearly wrong. russell holds onto the microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high voltage for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal. his face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off stage, collapsing a couple steps later.}
<L>__{exterior backstage night}
<A>__{dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has been pulled up into the backstage area. he guides a sagging russell, assisted by penny lane, into the bus.}

<A>__{william sits nearby, watching russell, making notes out of eye sight of others. the ever wary jeff, unseen by william, cranes to see that he's writing in his notebook. dick swings into the seat across from russell. the bus door shuts, as the promoter is still yelling. doris is slow to gain speed, as estrella appears, running alongside. she knocks on the window next to william.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{i forgot to tell you! your mom says to call home immediately. she says she knows what's going on!}
<P>__{(receding)}

<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(casually, to russell)}
<D>__{wanna buy a gate?}
<A>__{before russell can answer bash. doris barrels through the steel gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside this bus.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{you just bought a gate.}
<P>__{(to the bus)}
<D>__{c'mon doris!! get us out of town!!}
<A>__{the bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a thoroughfare.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what did it feel like to be electrocuted?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{it burns. it feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body... and then you see god, and he says, "how bad do you want to be legendary?" and god damnit.}
<A>__{i let go.}
<P>__{(shaky grin as all laugh warmly)}
<D>__{rock and roll.}

<C>__{penny}
<D>__{give that to me.}
<A>__{she grabs for it, they have a brief play fight. he grabs some other polaroids from her pocket. he hustles to the back of the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the passing landscapes. she chases him down the aisle. music continues as she sits down next to him. out the window, a long distance running team of girls keeps pace with the bus for a bit. they wave. penny watches them over sunglasses, waves briefly to the real world.}

<P>__{(breathing heavy, owning the world)}
<D>__{when we go to morocco, i think we should wear completely different clothes, and be completely different people.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what will our names be?}
<A>__{she snaps a polaroid of a nearby sleeping silent ed, pockets the polaroid. she regards russell up ahead, also sleeping. her attention has already wandered from morocco.}

<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you should give him a break. there are real problems in the band. off the record.}

<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{william, looking concerned over the state of his interviews, walks into the backstage bathroom. he makes a few surreptitious notes in his notebook before noticing that jeff is standing there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered by a local hanger on. seeing the kid, he immediately hides the coke spoon.}

<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{respectfully. we all have our roots. i believe in bands holding onto their roots. but those roots need to be augmented. i'm gonna tell you the truth i may enrage some and enthrall others. i don't really give a fuck. your manager here needs a manager.}
<A>__{example.}
<D>__{if you hadn't run out on the contract in phoenix, you could have sued over russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you.}
<A>__{russell looks at his hand.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{we can all work together. your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour. right now you owe the record company more than you've got. but your record's selling, there's money to be made. so i've brought a plane in, we can add more shows to make up the difference. respectfully.}

<P>__{(immediately)}

<D>__{but god forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make.}
<P>__{(rueful, to hendrix on the wall)}
<D>__{you might have died at the right time, my friend.}
<C>__{jann}

<B>__{long shot russell}
<A>__{at the entrance. raises his hand.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{good evening!}
<L>__{exterior san francisco day}
<A>__{russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go. oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a music of its own. it's a beautiful and compelling "silence." he thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath of life. his head filling again with the music of the world, he begins to walk down the street. very naturally, and quite randomly, he is noticed by young passersby. they can't help it. he looks like a star. they can't quite figure out who it is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the street. unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought, a small crowd begins to form... following him.}
<L>__{interior breakfast table day}
<A>__{a quiet kitchen. anita has been cooking. a substantial breakfast has been placed on the table. sausage, orange juice... and now anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with syrup and butter, in front of her mother. william watches his mother facing an old enemy white sugar.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{they're called pancakes. who knows when we'll be together again. splurge. it's what most people call breakfast.}
<A>__{mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i went through your records. and i found a song to play for you.}
<A>__{she goes to the stereo and puts on a record. the two children eye each other what's coming next? (song to be chosen) the two kids eye each other again. self consciously avoiding their gaze, mom sits and toys with her breakfast. it's a song she clearly wants them to hear. it's a song from the heart. they look at her, amazed. elaine looks up, regards her family. somehow they're back at this table. they continue eating breakfast.}
<B>__{on sidewalk}
<A>__{bam. a bundle of bound rolling stone magazines lands on the newsstand pavement with a thud. someone reaches in to cut the cord, as the magazines puff up into view. it's the new issue, with russell hammond on the cover. the title: stillwater runs deep. just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in the racks.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<A>__{music segues to led zeppelin's "four sticks." penny lane's sleeping polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few self portraits.}
