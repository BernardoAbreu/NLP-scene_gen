<A>__{anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, dr, resfield, 60, the head scientist. it is not a place that warms anderson's heart. biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting and examining protoplasmic tissue masses. other technicians peer through massive microscopes. still others use robotic arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded glass barriers.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{you don't get out here much.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{not my sort of place.}
<A>__{dr. resfield emits a dry little laugh.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{the head of precrime squeamish?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{when it comes to needles and scalpels, yeah.}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{i promise we won't use any on you.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{what do you use them on?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{on bits of this and that.}
<A>__{anderson looks at him. the doctor pauses outside a thick door. an identiscan device quickly reads their eyes, and the door opens with an electronic hiss. anderson looks around the lab. technicians lower mesh cylinders into some sort of chemical vat. another technician turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the roiling liquid.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{what's happening here?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{we're in an interesting phase.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{what's in the cylinders?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{neurotissue.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{from ...?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{a fusion of sources. from the precogs' deceased mother. from the precogs themselves.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{a fusion of ... ?}
<C>__{dr. resfield}
<D>__{in lay terms, we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth.}
<A>__{the cylinders shudder as the voltage is increased.}
<C>__{dr. resfield }
<D>__{and then we add mutating variables.}
<A>__{anderson stares into the roiling vat. dr. resfield waits for more questions. but it is clear from anderson's expression he has already learned enough.}
