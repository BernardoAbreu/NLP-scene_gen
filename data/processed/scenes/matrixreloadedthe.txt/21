<D>__{aye aye, capitano.}
<A>__{minimal cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.}
<L>__{interior main deck}
<A>__{the ships operator, a lean asian kid with a gaze like a laser scan, sits behind neo, whos sitting at the operators console with his hands on the abbreviated keyboard. trinity sits with them, her feet up as she observes. neo stares at the screen. its a huge syllabus of matrix code characters. he struggles to learn the complex code.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{"ka equals 9. but reverse ka is point nine, right? razor nods.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{you catch on quick, man.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"i know these symbols from the hacking trainer. but how come its so}
<D>__{hard to find them on the keyboard?"}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"your brain knows what to do. but it has to associate characters with}
<D>__{your body."}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"its muscle memory, neo. think of the space bar and your thumbs nail it. because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. but think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit}
<D>__{the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{where did these symbols come from, anyway?}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"most of it is from the old japanese. its katakana. see, the machines arent binary. no zero and one. theyre quantum based, so instead of an open close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all}
<D>__{numbers between zero and one."}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"all numbers between zero and one. that could be an infinite number of}
<D>__{numbers."}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{not could be, it is. neo is astounded.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{holy shit. how many calculations per second?}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"how many cps? well, thats kind of hard to estimate. put it this way: picture all the particles in the known universe. not just atoms, but}
<D>__{sub atomic particles that compose atoms."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{ok. at last count that was what, a gazillion, right? two gazillion? razor barely smiles at the joke.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"well, its up there. in any case, the number of calculations per second the matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of}
<D>__{particles in the known universe."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{woah.}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds}
<D>__{within their pcs."}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"ok. thats why it looks like reality. they have the computing power}
<D>__{to create entire worlds."}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"so, if we hack into the matrix, why cant we just change the code}
<D>__{while were at it?"}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"no, no. see, its not that simple. the machines, the programs that code, create, and maintain the matrix, the agents, they are code.}
<D>__{there are different types of agents, many work unseen with no}
<A>__{interaction in the matrix. then, there are the enforcers, the ones we}
<D>__{know all too well."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"well, my point is, the machines code and recode the matrix by pure will. interaction with the matrix, the physical act of being there, by default, allows people to change their environment the matrix.}
<D>__{they move objects, make sound, affect cause."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{like reality.}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"almost. reality is unalterable. but the fabric of reality in the matrix can be rewoven. some can reach beyond normal cause. their affects on the matrix are deeper than average. they have learned to change it according to their needs. but they dont have total control. thats why we need operators like razor here. but you, you go further}
<D>__{than any of us can."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{razor stands and taps neos skull. he stretches, grabs a japanese style wooden sword, and, out of boredom, starts performing slow, precise kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"the equipment you carry up here. youre a freak. a good freak. youre neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. this, combined with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the}
<D>__{reality of the matrix."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how did i end up as... a freak? razor practices the same strike a few times.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"good question. the machines create people through cloning, since, obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. theoretically, all clones in the matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. they}
<D>__{shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{ok, so how do you explain me?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{"not just you. morpheus, myself. we were all born inside.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{well, what separates us from others?}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"for the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children in the matrix. theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines never predicted. some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.}
<D>__{others seem to have psychic powers."}
<A>__{razor looks up to see morpheus, hanging back as he listens. he comes forward.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{and others are able to change the reality of the matrix itself. he points to neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{discussing history, are we? razor shakes his head.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. hes stuck in}
<D>__{the 20^th century. hes got no skills, man. without us, hes helpless."}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{in the matrix, without him, were helpless.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"not until we reach broadcast depth. its slow going out there. i guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. we have time}
<D>__{to rest and ready."}
