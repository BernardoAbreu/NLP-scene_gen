<L>__{int nite: nightclub (winter 1945)}
<A>__{the main floor of the nightclub is very large, with endless glistening wooden floors. now, at this late time, the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a negro janitor is waxing them. a single hat check girl is counting her receipts. luca moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar. another man, dark and very well built, moves behind the bar.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{luca...i'm bruno tattaglia.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{luca looks up; and out of the shadows emerges sollozzo.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{do you know who i am?}
<A>__{luca nods.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{you've been talking to the tattaglias. they thought we could do business.}
<A>__{luca listens.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{i need somebody strong to protect my operation, physically. i've heard you're not happy with your family, you might make a switch.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{if the money is good enough.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{on the first shipment, i can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.}
<A>__{luca looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good. sollozzo extends his hand, but luca pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth. bruno tattaglia, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to luca's cigarette. then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on luca's, almost patting it.}
