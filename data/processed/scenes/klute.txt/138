<L>__{interior bree's apartment day}
<A>__{the room is still disordered. bree and frank ligourin look at him, silently. bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her. frank sits nearby in a chair. klute smiles a little almost apologetically.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i'm always getting surprises.}
<A>__{bree doesn't answer. she sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others. frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. then }

<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? it's }

<A>__{klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to beat him. blood thickly descends the side of frank's face, as he struggles away. bree is screaming. bree grabs at him from behind. he thrusts her off. but it allows frank to break away through the still open door. klute pursues.}
