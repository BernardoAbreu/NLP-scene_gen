<A>__{gibbs nods to korshunov. korshunov nods one of his men. nevsky removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover exposing the tape. across the face of the tape is a thin strip of a rubbery substance. nevsky pulls the strip up and out, making a kind of fuse. he reaches for a pack of matches... courtesy matches, sporting the seal of the president. nevsky nods and lights the fuse. in a rapid succession gibbs tosses his two extra weapons to korshunov's men, pivots the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. the secret service agents try to get at their weapons, but gibbs has caught them completely off guard. several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck) and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading down the creases of the fine corinthian leather chairs. nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours out of it. smoke screen. bazylev and zedeck catch the guns gibbs tossed and hold them on the reporters.}
