<A>__{zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta. dean martin "innamaraia" plays on the stereo. eddie, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso. he starts carrying it over to zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other. zammito watches him with strained patience. joey "two tons" and nicky "the rake" enter. their faces tell the story.}
