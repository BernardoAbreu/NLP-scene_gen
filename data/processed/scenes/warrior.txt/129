<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you've got a visitor. second row, 10 o'clock.}
<A>__{buzzing in the arena. the lights about to go down for the entrance of koba. before they do, brendan looks up to see a familiar face at cageside. tess. he can't believe his eyes.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you alright with that?}
<A>__{brendan looks at his wife. she smiles broadly. mouths the words "i love you." brendan grins. kisses his glove and presses it against the cage. as he does, the lights go out inside the arena and ominous russian music blares.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{and here comes the great russian koba.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{koba is so intimidating. his reputation is larger than life.}
<A>__{the crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his way toward the cage. brendan watches. so does frank. tess takes a quick glance at koba, then looks away. she can't bear it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i want you to look right at him when he comes in here. don't take your eyes off him.}
<A>__{brendan nods, then looks at tess. drawing strength. frank leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i'm proud of you brother. this is your cage.}
<A>__{finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great russian climbs into the cage. he's massive, and the crowd stares at him like an exotic animal. josh rosenthal calls brendan and koba to the center of the cage. the russian looks at brendan with the cold, dispassionate eyes of a killer. brendan does his best to hold his gaze.}
<C>__{josh rosenthal}
<D>__{alright, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. i expect a clean fight.}

<C>__{callen }
<D>__{should i be nervous for brendan? `cause i am. i want to stop the fight before it even begins.}
<C>__{josh rosenthal}
<D>__{gentlemen, you ready? you ready? let's go to war!}
<A>__{koba comes straight at brendan. his speed and strength are astonishing.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{now the question is, how long can brendan conlon stay alive?}
<A>__{franks screams at brendan to keep his distance. tess watches through her fingers. and koba keeps coming, snapping brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an uppercut to the chin. the russian is doing whatever he wants to brendan. he slices him up with strikes. bruises his legs with kicks. works him against the fence. power slams him.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{koba just pounding on brendan conlon! he's pounding on him like a side of beef!}
