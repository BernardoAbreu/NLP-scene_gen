<A>__{a wood panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree lined road and heads up toward tall wrought iron gates. on a white washed wall are black letters: "meadow wood convalescent home". the station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. the gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree lined driveway. as it goes by, we see frances sitting in the back seat between lillian and one of the women from the previous scene. the car heads up toward a large spanish style building set back among some trees.}
