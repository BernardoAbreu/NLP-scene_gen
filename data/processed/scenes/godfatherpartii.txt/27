<L>__{exterior tahoe swimming pools and harbor day}
<A>__{francesca and gardner are greeted by her twin sister and their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news. someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{francesca kisses her aunt kay.}
<C>__{francesca}
<D>__{uncle michael is the greatest man ever!}
<A>__{view on kay happy for her niece.}
<L>__{interior tahoe boathouse day}
<A>__{michael sits in the darkened boathouse. tom hagen paces. michael is looking at photographs. neri stands over him.}
<B>__{close on michael}
<A>__{studying the pictures.}
<C>__{neri }
<D>__{his name is fred vincent. he owns a small pizza parlor in buffalo...}
<B>__{close on the pictures}
<A>__{snapshots of a middle aged man, handsome, italian. there is something familiar about him.}
<C>__{neri }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...american wife and two small kids. we traced him and found that he's in the country illegally, from sicily...}
<A>__{michael looks at another picture. the same man. only younger, and dressed in sicilian shepherd's clothing. we remember him as fabrizzio...michael's traitorous bodyguard in sicily.}
<C>__{neri }
<D>__{...came over around 1956. sponsored by the barzini family.}
<A>__{michael puts the pictures down.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's him. fabrizzio.}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{revenge is a dish that tastes best when it's cold.}
<C>__{neri}
<D>__{how do you want me to handle it?}
<A>__{michael glances at hagen, who has been waiting in the room.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{later. tom?}
<A>__{hagen brings him a folder; then, as michael glances through it:}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i've cleared it through the senator's chief aide, a man named turnbull. turnbull's a heavy gambler, and into us for over a hundred grand, so i figure his information is reliable.}
<A>__{neri moves to the bar, to prepare michael a drink.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{the senator can be set up; but he thinks of himself as a clean politician. so it's got to be on terms he can live with: campaign contribution, donation to a charitable cause that he controls, things like that. if he gets even the inkling that you think you're buying him, he'll freeze up. nevada's a funny state, they like things both ways here... all right. turnbull says the senator will be here at two thirty, and he's been primed. he knows you'll want to meet with him alone, and he knows it's about the tropicana's license. at any rate, he expects to be introduced around to some of the influential people here today, and generally treated as an ordinary guest. just go light on him, mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks don't like to think of themselves as crooks...}
<A>__{michael glances at hagen, as though that last remark was unnecessary.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i'm sorry; of course, you know that.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{two thirty. that gives me time to see my boy.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{connie's outside.}
<A>__{michael doesn't want to see her.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i promised; she said it was urgent.}
<A>__{michael nods.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{all right. apologize to pentangeli.}
<A>__{neri opens the door; hagen exits, and connie steps in impatiently, followed by merle.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i said i would see my sister, alone.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i think this concerns me too.}
<P>__{(taking a cigarette from the dispenser)}
<D>__{you don't, do you?}
<A>__{connie steps forward, kisses michael on the cheek.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{how are you, honey? you've met merle, haven't you. he was with me in vegas.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i saw him with you.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{we're going to europe next week. i want to get passage booked on the queen.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{why do you come to me? why don't you go to a travel agent?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{we're going to get married first.}
<A>__{michael is silent. then he rises, and moves to the window overlooking the lake.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the ink on your divorce isn't dry. your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, michael francis... was in some trouble with the reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{michael...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{you're not my father!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then why do you come to me?}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{because i need money!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{connie, i want to be reasonable with you. you have a house here, with us. you can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything. i don't know much about merle; i don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. he'll understand. but if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{it was my father's money; and i'm entitled to what i need. where is tom hagen?}
<A>__{she turns angrily, leaving michael standing face to face with merle.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{are you finished?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then out.}
<A>__{merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.}
