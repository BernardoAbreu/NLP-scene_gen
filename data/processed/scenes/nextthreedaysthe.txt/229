<A>__{john takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35. he then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos, sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. he decides it is too late to worry. he loosens an edge of wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.}

<A>__{luke sits in the back seat with their carry on bags. john tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the back. he picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to the alley. he looks around, then stuffs this final bag into his neighbor's trash can.}
