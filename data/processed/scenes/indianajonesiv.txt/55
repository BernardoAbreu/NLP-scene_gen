<A>__{the swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many pirates at bay. scraggy exchanges swordplay with a pirate. the sword is knocked from scraggy's hand. he is defenseless. the pirate comes in for the kill. he raises his sword...ready to plunge it into scraggy's heart... the pirate suddenly pauses. a horrified look on his face. the end of a sword shoots out of the pirate's chest! a moment passes...the sword slides back inside of the pirate's chest. the pirate falls to the deck. betsy stands behind him. she holds the bloodied sword. scraggy gives her a thankful nod.}
