<A>__{louise is a waitress in a coffee shop. she is in her early thirties, but too old to be doing this. she is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift. she is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter. it is making a lot of racket, which she is oblivious to. there is country muzak in the b.g., which she hums along with.}
