<L>__{interior blue bay pd interview room day}
<A>__{elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger. she stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection... tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab on her lip, covering the wound marie inflicted at the party. and slowly elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to flow once more... there's a quiet knock on the door and elena quickly lowers her hand, looks round... kristen richards, the young parole officer who so heart wrenchingly told her story at blue bay high earlier, comes quietly into the gray room.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{elena.}
<A>__{elena just looks up at her pitifully.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{could you tell me what happened?}
<A>__{through stifled sobs, elena states...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{it was jay clifford. he raped me...}
<A>__{the interview room door swings open and detective michael morrison, 30's, enters. he's the personification of the term "overworked, underpaid."}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{you understand the seriousness of this allegation, young lady?}
<A>__{elena nods weakly.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{and you know that we'll leave no stone un turned in the investigation.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{there'll be a battery of forensics tests you'll have to take, humiliating stuff. and background checks, digging up all kinds of dirt. and you'll have to testify in court, face the man you're accusing...}
<A>__{crocodile tears roll down elena's cheeks.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{you sure you want to go through with this? no harm, no foul, you can just walk away right now....}
<A>__{kristen interjects...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{please, detective, this isn't the right time...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i ain't lying. you think i'm lying?}
<A>__{kristen turns to her young ward...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{if you're telling the truth, you won't find a more sympathetic ear...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{'if' i'm telling the truth...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{and if you're not, there's gonna be trouble, you understand?}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{this is already trouble. the man you're accusing happens to be a friend of mine, and when the dna tests prove you're lying i'm gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks, mark my words...}
<A>__{elena withers under his glare...}
