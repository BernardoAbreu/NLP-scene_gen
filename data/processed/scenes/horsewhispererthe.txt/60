<L>__{exterior horse arena, california day}
<A>__{inside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked by tom. as he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to the crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great skill guileless, sensible, of the earth.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{... it's always kind of interesting to hear the horse's side of the story...}
<A>__{the crowd laughs warmly. he directs his comments to a woman wearing an expensive ralph lauren western outfit, standing outside the corral...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{now if he was cranky or lazy, like you say he is, we'd be seeing his tail twitching there and his ears back, maybe. but this isn't a cranky horse, it's a scared horse. you see how braced he is up around the neck back there. he just doesn't know which way to turn...}
<A>__{the woman nods. tom turns the horse on a dime so that he always stays facing the circling thoroughbred...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you see how he keeps pointing his hindquarters in at me? well, i'd guess the reason he seems reluctant to move out is because when he does, he gets in trouble for it.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{he's not good at transitions, you know? when i want him to move from a trot to a lope, say...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well, i'm sure that's what you think but that's not what i'm seeing. you may think you're asking for a lope, but your body may be saying something else altogether. you might be putting too many conditions on him. for instance, you might be saying "go, but, hey, don't go too fast." he can tell that from the way you feel. your body can't lie. you ever give him a kick to make him move out?}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{he won't go unless i do.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and then he goes and you feel like he's going too fast, so you yank him back?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{and next thing you know, he's bucking.}
<P>__{(she nods again)}
<D>__{well, if someone told you to go, stop, go, stop you'd buck too.}
<A>__{the people laugh. the woman smiles self consciously.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's a dance, see... somebody has to lead and somebody has to follow.}
<A>__{tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, "dancing". he then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the coils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst into a lope. and again... making the animal go from a trot to a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i want him to get so he can leave real soft. he's getting the idea now. he's not all braced up and tense like he was at the start. he's finding out it's okay.}
<A>__{he throws the rope again and this time the transition to the lope is a smooth one.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you see that? he's getting better already. pretty soon, if you work at it, you'll be able to make all these transitions easy on a loose rein.}
<P>__{(sotto voce, wry)}
<D>__{yeah, and pigs'll fly.}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{he's going to be okay so long as you don't go yanking on him.}
<A>__{she nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. he walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and speaks sympathetically:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look, the truth is it's all about self preservation. these animals.}
<P>__{(with great affection)}
<D>__{... well, they just have such big hearts, you know? there's nothing they want more than to do what you want them to do. but when the messages get all confused, the only thing they know to do is try and save themselves... now, why don't you go saddle up and see what happens.}
<A>__{feeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt man's man, the woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb over the rail. her horse lets her come right up to him and stroke his neck. tom comments;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they won't ever hold a thing against you. they're the most forgiving creatures god ever made.}
<A>__{turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{okay, who's next?}
<A>__{a young boy leads a mule into the ring. tom smiles:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{now god has another idea entirely with the mule.}
