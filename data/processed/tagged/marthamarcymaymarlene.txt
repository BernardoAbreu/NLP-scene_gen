<L>__{exterior farm day}
<A>__{it is a hot summer day. a large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. two men tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. three women work in a vegetable garden. two women hang wet clothes on a clothes line. two men work in a cluttered garage on an old car. four women sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. one woman breast feeds a new born. the others knit a large blanket. two women and two men swim naked in a swimming hole. a man in his forties sits alone in a room reading. a man chops wood. a bare foot toddler plays alone in the driveway.}
<L>__{interior farm house day}
<A>__{a large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor. two women are in the kitchen preparing food. martha, sets a table for eight. martha is beautiful but appears run down. she is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older. a bell rings off screen.}
<L>__{interior farm house dining room evening}
<A>__{the men sit around a table eating dinner. one man sits at the head of the table, this is patrick. patrick is older than the other men. to his right is watts, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard.}
<L>__{interior farm house kitchen continuous}
<A>__{the women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. the men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside. the women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food.}
<L>__{interior farm house dining room moments later}
<A>__{the women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food. katie sits at the head of the table.}

<L>__{interior farm house early morning}
<A>__{the kitchen is filled with dishes. two babies sleep next to each other in an old broken crib. a teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib. people are strewn all over the house sleeping. suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame.}
<L>__{exterior farm house continuous}
<A>__{martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. she carries a small bag. her pace becomes increasingly faster. she looks back to see a teenage girl, sarah, standing in the window watching. martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. as she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run. slow zoom: martha disappears into the thick woods. off screen, the house door slams shut. a man urgently yells out: "marcy may" the camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind. for a moment everything is quiet. suddenly, a man and two women enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after martha.}
<L>__{exterior woods continuous}
<A>__{the woods are dark. martha runs as fast as she can. she hears the man's voice calling her from a distance. a man and two women are chasing her. martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. she keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls. martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent. martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her pass by.}
<L>__{exterior diner parking lot day}
<A>__{martha uses a pay phone at a diner. she dials and waits. she is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.}

<D>__{i want to see you martha. please.}
<A>__{martha thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{martha!}
<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. she devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days. the entrance bell rings. martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. a family walks in. they are seated. martha returns to eating.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{marcy may?}
<A>__{it is watts. his voice paralyzes her.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what are you doin'?}
<A>__{martha stops eating. he slides into the booth and sits across from her. watts reaches over and takes some french fries. he eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. she can't look at him.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{we were worried about you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{patrick's worried about you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i just wanted to come into town.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i could've brought you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i wanted to walk.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{through the woods?}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(to watts)}
<D>__{can i get you something?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(to martha)}
<D>__{you done?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the waitress goes to take martha's plate. watts puts his hand out to stop her.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(to martha)}
<D>__{you not gonna eat that?}
<A>__{watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. the waitress clears the plate. watts takes martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{you ready to go?}
<A>__{martha doesn't respond.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{not right now.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{the waitress drops the check on the table. watts stares at martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. he sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. he stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. he grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{i will get this.}
<A>__{he lets go. her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. she does not look at him. he leans in and forces eye contact with her. watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. it is very busy. he does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. he leans down and kisses martha on the cheek. she doesn't kiss back. he holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. she reluctantly kisses him on the lips. martha watches him walk outside. as soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop later}
<A>__{martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop. she does not look well. she turns and vomits behind the bench.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop later}
<A>__{martha hides between two parked buses. she watches a black bmw pull into the parking lot. lucy, a well dressed woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. martha walks towards lucy. lucy rushes over and hugs martha.}
<L>__{interior lucy's car day}
<A>__{martha, wrapped in lucy's sweater, leans her head against the window watching the road behind her in the side view mirror.}
<C>__{lucy}

<D>__{you too.}
<A>__{lucy notices that martha's left ear is bruised.}

<L>__{interior lake house kitchen night}
<A>__{the house is completely dark. martha finds her way through the hallway and into the kitchen. she drinks water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst. the kitchen has large windows, through which a bright spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is beyond that. martha is scared to look outside. she forces herself to slowly turn and look. she puts her head down and quickly returns to her room.}
