<A>__{close on tracy her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted from crying.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{one vote... one vote}
<A>__{she falls again headlong again into the throes of despair. her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry of pain. her anguish grows convulsive. barbara flick comes in and sits on the bed. she's carrying a prescription bottle and a glass of milk.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{why don't you take a couple of my pills, darling? you'll feel better.}
<A>__{tracy takes the pills and sips the milk weakly. her mother kisses her.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{don ' t worry. .. don ' t worry. . . sshhhhh... that's it, baby... that's it, darling. everything's going to be fine.}
<A>__{she lays tracy on the bed, and tracy begins to quiet. barbara kisses her again and rises to leave. at the door she pauses to add a few final words of comfort.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{maybe you needed more posters, honey. or if you'd taken my suggestions about your speech. i don't know. we'll figure it out.}
