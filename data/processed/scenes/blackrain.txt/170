<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the room later kobo is led back into the room by two guards. the guards shove him down to the floor. his hands are still bound. nick walks over and stands above him. he doesn't say a word. just stands above him. then, nick pulls spare change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by one, in front of kobo's face, like kobo did to him. he walks away. sugai steps in.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{abolofia's person has received the plate. it's done.}
<A>__{a door opens at the far end of the room. it's kobo's girlfriend, the one nick and ich had been following. she starts toward kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.}
<C>__{sugai}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{i wanted you to see him like this.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{let him go, father.}
<B>__{on ich}
<A>__{realizing she's sugai's daughter.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{you're too old...}
<C>__{sugai}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<A>__{sugai turns away and picks up the sword. the guards clutch kobo. sugai's going to kill kobo after all. the girl screams at him to stop. sugai's oblivious.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{that wasn't our deal.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{you want him dead too.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{after a court convicts him. he belongs to me.}
<A>__{there's a long pause. then, something unusual happens. sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten kobo's wrist. when he does, sugai hands kobo the sword and demands that he cut off his finger. this is yubitsume: the ritual act within the yakuza of slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a mistake. kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses. sugai nods to a guard who places kobo's finger on the table.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{stares defiantly at sugai. he doesn't even wince as the blade slices off his finger. the guard hands sugai the finger in a handkerchief.}
<C>__{sugai}
<P>__{(looking at nick)}
<D>__{if anything happens to abolofia or my plate, detective...}
<A>__{hold on nick then }
