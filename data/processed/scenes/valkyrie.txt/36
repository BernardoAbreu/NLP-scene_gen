<A>__{darkness. as our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods. is this a dream? a nightmare? we are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance.}
<L>__{exterior forest clearing night}
<A>__{from out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous, almost mousy young woman, fraulein von oven. walking just behind her is tresckow. he carries a small but heavy case in one hand. they come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight. in the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers, including the original orders for operation valkyrie, next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the reich. the orders have been meticulously annotated.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{were you followed?}
<A>__{fraulein oven gasps. tresckow turns, pistol drawn. the tip of his barrel comes up just inches from stauffenberg's eyepatch. stauffenberg smiles, emerging from the shadows.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{dammit, stauffenberg. you scared me half to death.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we'll be closer than that before we're finished.}
