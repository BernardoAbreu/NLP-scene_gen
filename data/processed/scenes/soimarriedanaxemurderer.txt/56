<L>__{interior hallway harriet's apartment evening}
<A>__{charlie knocks on the door. rose answers.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{you're back. but harriet's not here yet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe i could wait.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{sure. that would be fine.}
<A>__{she then starts to slowly close the door. he props it open with his hand.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{inside? i was hoping...}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(letting him in)}
<D>__{i'm glad you asked. i didn't want to be so forward. i mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, i sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and i don't really have time to hear. you know?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i couldn't agree with you more.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i think about a lot of things.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead.}
<P>__{("ah, here's an angle")}
<D>__{i mean, to tell you the truth, i'd love to see your work.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{okay! what would you like me to do?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i don't want to see you work. i was talking about your work. your photographs. that one that i saw was so, wonderful, and...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{harriet's far more talented than i am.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, i'm sure it's so subjective anyway and...}
<P>__{(out of patience)}
<D>__{rose, show me your photos.}
<B>__{close on photographs}
<A>__{there are two kinds. beautiful travel pictures and very erotic black and white portraits of young men and women. all with a slight sadomasochistic quality. at the bottom of every photo is says: "seasons greetings".}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, these are some interesting photos here. very impressive. nice shots of sauselito and... some good bondage shots. a lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together.}
<P>__{(new thought)}
<D>__{hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of harriet by chance, would you?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(re: her cards)}
<D>__{well, i don't think she'd wanna do this sort of...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, no, not that. just, in general some photos. any little snapshot would do.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i doubt i'd have any. harriet hates being photographed.}
<A>__{the sound of a key in the door as harriet enters the apartment.}
<C>__{harriet }
<D>__{rose did i see charlie's car out in front?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{we're in here, harriet.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(walking in)}
<D>__{what are you guys doing?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(covering up)}
<D>__{oh, nothing. just looking through some of rose's work.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{...charlie wanted a photo of you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and that. that too.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{why of me, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, sentimental reasons. something to remind me of you when we're not together.}
<A>__{she takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{there, can you remember that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay, it's just, i was gonna give one to my parents, too, and...}
<P>__{(getting nowhere)}
<D>__{another time would be fine. it's hardly a matter of life and death.}
<A>__{tv set playing the evening news}
<C>__{news anchorman}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{in the news tonight, regarding a beverly hills jeweler, morris cohan, who died last week, police are now suspecting that morris's partner, lawrence sachs, may have murdered him with an untraceable poison.}
