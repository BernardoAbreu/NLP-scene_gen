<A>__{angle across nancy's "tree lawn", the grass between the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction of glen's home. this angle doesn't quite reveal nancy's house. foreground is a utility truck in which a half dozen hispanic workers are loading tools, extension cords and hardware. they look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work. marge appears and hands a check to the foreman of the crew, a white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain. he scrutinizes it.}

<C>__{foreman}
<D>__{don't bust my chops, lady. if the city found out i put 'em in without inside releases i'd loose my license.}
<A>__{he shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck. marge exits frame for her house. pan with the truck as it pulls away, then pick up nancy, walking across the street from the corner. alone. dispirited. she lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.}

<D>__{oh gross...}
<A>__{widening to reveal the house as nancy walks across her front yard. every single window has been covered with brand new ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames . closer, at a window. nancy gives a set of bars a powerful shake. they don't budge. then girl looks up and sees even the window to her second floor bedroom is barred. and the rose trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.}
