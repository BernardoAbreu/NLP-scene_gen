<L>__{interior mcp tron}
<A>__{about to fire again. there's a sudden roar and tron turns. tron's pov of giant sark who rips open the doorway into the mcp and advances.}
<B>__{bridge}
<A>__{yori has steered them right next to the beam. she turns to flynn, goes up to him.}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{flynn... you can't... i}

<C>__{flynn }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i'm sure tron wouldn't mind if... just once...}
<A>__{his head bends down and their lips meet. yori's body begins to glow, change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the love scene with tron, sparkling and gorgeous. her eyes are closed. close up their faces finally flynn pulls away from her. her eyes stay shut for a second, then open.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<B>__{longer shot}
<A>__{he releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. we see yori shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion directly into the center of mcp itself.}
