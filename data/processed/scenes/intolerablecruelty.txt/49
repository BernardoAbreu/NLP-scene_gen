<A>__{joe is raising the gun at miles. miles sprays him with mace. bang joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a take off. slam marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose. she finishes with a solid groin kick. it slows him down, but doesn't stop him. joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing. bang joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler. marylin runs to miles. he takes her hand and they run toward the door, seeking egress. bang still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly bobbles it. joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from falling. he momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler. miles pops up in front of him.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin. run. i will distract him.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i'm not leaving you. i took self defense}
<A>__{joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points the inhaler at miles. he squeezes whush miles squints against the asthma mist and lets out a horrified:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{joe!}
<A>__{bang! the off screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a body dropping heavily to the floor. silence. marylin runs over to miles. they look sadly down at the floor.}

<D>__{we told him it was no go...}
