<A>__{james bond, dressed impeccably as ever, is being frisked by three thugs in armani suits. they remove a gun from inside his jacket, a well concealed knife, a metal case, laying them on the desk that separates bond and... lachaise...an extremely well groomed gentleman. behind him, three floor to ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.}

<C>__{bond}
<D>__{which is neutral, no doubt.}
<A>__{lachaise takes the joke a little tight lipped. gestures for bond to sit. a girl enters, a gorgeous swiss bombshell in a pin striped suit. she pushes a cart. on it are a briefcase and a box of expensive cigars, which she offers to lachaise and bond.}

<C>__{bond}
<D>__{my glasses.}
<A>__{lachaise nods. bond can have his glasses. he puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:}
