<A>__{we now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a similar size to kirsty's. it is slightly more decorated; it has curtains and wallpaper. and a tiled floor. sitting cross legged on the floor next to the puzzle is tiffany. the puzzle, which we can now see more clearly, is an intricate abstract design in black and white. there are several pieces still un fitted but tiffany is working steadily, efficiently, and with complete concentration. on a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress over the last few months. sealed in plastic by staff members are. puzzles she has solved, with dates marking her advancement. they begin with the simplest wood block animals usually given to very small children. passing through photo puzzles of increasing difficulty, and culminating in one or two other examples of the kind of complicated pattern work she is involved in now.}
