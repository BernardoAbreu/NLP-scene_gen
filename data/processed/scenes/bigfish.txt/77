<L>__{interior at the checkout night}
<A>__{reaching the cashier, sandra hands over her coupons. will is approaching with a newsweek magazine. two checkstands over, an attractive blonde woman in her 50's is getting her change. though she's sandra's generation, she carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans and sneakers. she accidentally makes eye contact with will as he passes. we hold on the woman, who tracks will as he reaches sandra. it's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or just find him attractive? will notices the gaze. the woman turns away. will racks his brain does he know this woman?}

<A>__{sandra looks. after a beat, the blonde woman turns again, semi casually. noticing that both will and sandra are looking, she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.}
