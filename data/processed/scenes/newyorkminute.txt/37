<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior "today show" sidewalk morning}
<A>__{"today show" security guards and nypd descend on the crowd.}
<C>__{nypd officer}
<D>__{all right. who's the wise guy?}
<A>__{parker pulls drew out of the pile up and grabs the key, tossing it away from them, sending the desk clerk scrambling after it. the two girls high tail it around the corner. winded, they stop.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{man, that little guy could really motor. why'd you bolt?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{there was a rat, parker. a rat the size of a doberman eating my foot.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that was all our money.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{our money? our money?!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{key down, you're going to have an attack.}
<A>__{drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits out the words.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{parker, it was not 'our' money and this is not 'our' day in new york. what it is, is quite possibly the most important day of my life. i've resigned myself to the fact that you don't give a crap about what you do with yours, but if you could find it in your heart, your tiny, cold steel heart, to respect what this means to me, i would appreciate it.}
<A>__{but parker's not listening. she's staring intently... ... across the street where several town cars are parked, the drivers chatting next to a hot dog pretzel cart. among them is bennie, sipping coffee. parker spots him and freezes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you're not even listening. that's typical. look, we're splitting up. give me back my secret safety money.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(still looking past drew)}
<D>__{you know how i told you not to be paranoid?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{paranoid?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what i meant was, it isn't paranoia if someone really is chasing you.}
<A>__{parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that drew should look across the street.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what's wrong with your eyes?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's him.}
<A>__{drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{quiet. don't run. he'll see us.}
<A>__{not wanting to draw his attention, the girls shuffle off quickly down the street. on bennie squinting across at them. can he make them out in the crowd? he nods to another driver, tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he saw us!}
<A>__{the girls break into a run.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{how'd he find us?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{maybe it's just coincidence!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{or maybe we told him where we were going!!}
<A>__{she points up at the street sign 57th and 5th. oops.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{parker leads her into traffic, horns blaring, as they weave their way across. on the far side, a horse carriage pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, parker spots a fresh pile of... ... horse shit, which she manages to leap. drew, however, isn't going to make it over. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{drew stumbles, wrong foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb. for just a beat, we see her surprised face. hm. i did it. then they see bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and plops into on his ass. this gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors.}
