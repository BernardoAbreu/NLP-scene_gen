<A>__{chapin is conferring with another u.s. attorney, davis, and agents miller and cerrone.}
<C>__{cerrone}
<D>__{you really think vitti is crazy?}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{yeah, he's about as crazy as i am. think about it. locked up, he was absolutely no use to me. but back on the street, vitti's still powerful enough to pose a threat to both families. it's like throwing gasoline on a fire.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{if we can use vitti to escalate this war, we might just end up putting them all away.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's if he goes back to his old life.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{if? people like paul vitti don't change. this guy's been a menace to society since he was twelve years old. being a criminal is all he knows. trust me.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{he's gonna head straight for trouble. then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces. we could get twenty, maybe even thirty indictments next time the grand jury convenes.}

<C>__{davis}
