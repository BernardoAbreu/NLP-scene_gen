<L>__{interior dress shop, north michigan avenue morning}
<A>__{the place is stunning. high ceiling, soft light, large rococo mirrors, louis quatorze sofas and chairs. michael wanders rest lessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish female patrons. takes a look at his watch.}
<L>__{interior dressing room morning}
<A>__{a period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried walls. kimmy sits on a louis treize loveseat next to a stack of costly gowns. watching with an expertise beyond her years, as... ... julianne stands on a platform. a seamstress fitting her into a sleek pale daffodil colored gown. there are pins everywhere, as the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit. continuously looking to kim for approval.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{if you'd rather the lilac...}
<A>__{julianne shakes her head. this one is beautiful.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{not you. you won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.}
<A>__{julianne glances over.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what else did he tell you...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{... you hate weddings, you never go.}
<A>__{oh. well, yeah.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you're not up for anything conventional, or popularly assumed to be female priorities. including marriage. or romance. or even...}
<A>__{and she stops. not wanting to offend.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{... not even love.}
<A>__{the look holds. the seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that's why michael and i were the wrong fit. right from the start.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he said that, too.}
<A>__{she stands up. walks to the platform. smooths her hand over the fabric down julianne's back, along her hips. communicating to the seamstress with her irritated expression.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{well, i thought i was like you. and proud to be. until i met rumpled, smelly old michael...}
<A>__{pins start to come out. kimmy points, these, too!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{and then i found i was just a sentimental schmuck. like all those flighty nitwits i'd always pitied.}
<A>__{she leans forward. so they can look at each other.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{funny world, huh?}
<A>__{julianne swallows. it is that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i need a smoke.}
<A>__{and before anyone can breathe, she steps off the platform ripping the living shit out of the gown, right down the side. the seam stress' eyes flash open in abject horror. julianne, a deer in headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw up in six different mirrors. kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{it's mostly the seam. let's get this to carlos.}
<A>__{and unzips julianne down the back. in her rush to step out, julianne stumbles, but her arms are pinned by the pulled down dress and she just... ... topples like a felled oak, thudding on her face, the gown ripping some more, the seamstress screaming like an idiot. then. silence. julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog, bound in her dress.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{just. don't. move.}
<A>__{like you talk to a three year old. deftly, kimmy pulls the dress free, leaving julianne in her underwear. signals to the seamstress, let's go.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{don't you have to be somewh...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{... just my bridal shower. and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one thirty game.}
<A>__{opens the door...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{other than that...}
<A>__{closed solid. gone.}
