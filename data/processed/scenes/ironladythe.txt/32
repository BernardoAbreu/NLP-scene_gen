<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what i do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. yes we help people of course we help people. but for those that can do, they must just get up and do. and if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and do something about it, change things.}
