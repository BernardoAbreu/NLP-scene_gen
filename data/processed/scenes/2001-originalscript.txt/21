<A>__{bowman is still reading and working on his dessert.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{dave, if you've a minute, i'd like your advice on something.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{sure, what is it?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{it's about my salary cheques.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{well i got the papers on my official up grading to ags 19 two weeks before we left.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes, i remember you mentioning it. i got mine about the same time.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{that's right. well, naturally, i didn't say anything to payroll. i assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the nexterior pay cheque. but it's been almost three weeks now and i'm still being paid as an ags 18.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{interesting that you mention it, because i've got the same problem.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{yesterday, i finally called the accounting office at mission control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the ags 19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{did they have any explanation for this?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{not really. they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall, and that we're being charged against different accounting offices.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{well, what do you think we ought to do about it?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. i'm sure they'll straighten it out.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{i must say, i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no. i never did, either.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{we spent so little time with them, i have trouble keeping their names straight.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i suppose the idea was specialized training.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{i suppose so. though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{yes. you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no, as a matter of fact, i didn't.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{well, what is it?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{i don't know. all i heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{that seems very unlikely.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{yes, i thought so.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{just ask hal. it's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from hal.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?}
<A>__{poole walks to the hal 9000 computer.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{hal... dave and i believe that there's something about the mission that we weren't told. something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. we'd like to know whether this is true.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm sorry, frank, but i don't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{okay, then how do we re phrase the question?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{still, you really don't believe it, do you?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{not really. though, it is strange when you think about it. it didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{i know. it would be almost inconceivable.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{but not completely inconceivable?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{i suppose it isn't logically impossible.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i guess it isn't.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{still, all we have to do is ask hal.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{right. hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i will if i can, frank.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn. true or false?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{our transit time is 257 days. is that true?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{at the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. is this true?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezvous with us and bring us back. is this true?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{that's true}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. is that true?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{poole}
