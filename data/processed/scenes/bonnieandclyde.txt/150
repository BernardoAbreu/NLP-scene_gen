<A>__{on c.w.'s moonlit chest and face, tattooed bluebirds heaving and occasionally snoring in the night. behind him the room is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of sight on the floor. the shapes in the room the bed is gutted and only the box mattress remains dresser, lamp shades, etc., are grotesque in the flickering light. o.s. sounds of bonnie and clyde, bonnie giggling and clyde whispering something we can't quite hear. move across the room toward the gutted bed. move giggling from the floor beneath the box mattress for a moment it should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going on between bonnie and clyde.}

<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{clyde's voice}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{aw bonnie }

<P>__{(coaxing)}
<D>__{c'mon!}
<A>__{clyde's arm wielding a tommy gun, clears the bed. with the muzzle, clyde knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser overhead, bringing bonnie and clyde into view. closer angle mirror bonnie and clyde. night. bonnie lies stiff as a statue on the white mattress, impeccably dressed for her funeral. candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie at her head and feet. bonnie's hands and face are powdered and painted a waxen white. she wears a garish silk bow in her hair which it, for this occasion, curled like a little girl's. clyde sits up, beer bottle in one hand, tommy gun in the other, derby hat cocked and just a little unsure of the whole thing. he takes a swig bonnie stops him, trying terribly hard not to change her position.}

<D>__{lie down now, honey.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i've done enough!}
<A>__{angle on mirror bonnie and clyde. night.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(with patience, to a child)}
<D>__{you have to lie down...it's the only way we can tell what we'll look kike together.}
<A>__{she giggles again, more than a little gassed herself. clyde clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down beside her. clyde is both amused and annoyed.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(rising, weaving a little)}
<D>__{you can't wear polka dots on an occasion like this.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well what }
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{stripes. don't go away now.}
<A>__{she weaves her way over to the dresser, takes a swig from a bottle there herself, checks her makeup, and returns with the tie. holding against his chest to try it out she almost falls into him. clyde steadies her.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{she tries to tie it for him, and clearly has trouble with the knot.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ok, o.k. if we're gonna do this, at least i can tie it myself. lie down before you fall down.}
