<L>__{exterior national park entrance day}
<A>__{the sun burns above. the passat turns into the park.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot, ranger station day}
<A>__{the passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. next to the lot is the ranger station.}
<L>__{interior ranger base station day}
<A>__{maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. a display of some of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant bear, fill in the gaps. mike and sheryl enter. they take in the place. mike heads toward the ranger's desk while sheryl eyes the decor. sam, 65, a round faced ranger with a grumpy disposition, a hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. he continues working, scribbling on something as sheryl and mike wait. and wait. then...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{sam holds up a "wait a second" finger. after a beat...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{now what can i do you two for?}
<A>__{sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. hiking gear for sale, tour info, national park history, etc.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well...ah...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{first time here and you're not quite sure where to begin.}
<A>__{sheryl grabs a national park information flier. angle on there are pictures, an emergency contact information, guided tour info, etc.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{precisely like that.}
<A>__{sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort. as he digs around for something... sheryl notices, on the board... angle on a flier for a young missing couple. below that... angle on a photo of a girl: "sarah travers"(from the opening scene). sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms with mike at the desk.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{get you started with one of these.}
<A>__{sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how long you folks hiking for?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{two days. heading out early sunday.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, if you move at a decent clip, you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow. should still give you time to take it all in and make it down.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{any particular path?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you folks experienced hikers?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we've done some ah }
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{no. nothing like this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{for first timers, i recommend either willow creek bridge or donner trail.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{donner trail? as in "the donner party?"}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not sure of the name's origin. they're the two paths we regularly patrol. something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where do we camp?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{unless it says not to, you can set up where you like. just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. oh, and this here's bear country. they're not animals to fool with. you see one, you head the other way, especially if he's feeding. if the bear thinks you're getting in the way of his food, that's all she wrote.}
<A>__{sheryl warily eyes the stuffed bear in the station.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you got yourself a first aid kit?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{nurse betty here's my first aid kit.}
<A>__{sam looks confused...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{don't mind him. i'm a nurse.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{good for you. the question was, do you have a first aid kit?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{yes, we have a first aid kit.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{great, see how easy that was.}
<P>__{(moving on)}
<D>__{it's off season, park's pretty quiet. even more than usual. you may run into a few locals, but }
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{people live up here?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home. most of `em are friendly. respect their land and they'll respect you.}
<A>__{mike twangs and air banjos, "dueling banjos" from `deliverance.' sam is not amused. sheryl fights her temptation to laugh.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(moving on)}
<D>__{base is just outside, to the left. at about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{mike and sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit.}
