<A>__{inside the arson squad, duffy sits behind his desk. jordy stands across the table from his chief. behind jordy we can see garcia and korfin outside, listening. duffy has a subpoena in his hand.}

<D>__{the public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! this is going to be our rodney king!}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do? the guy tried to mug me. i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot.}

<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{how are you going to fight this? maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. you'd have the good to weight against the bad! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do! gimme your shield.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{but chief? over this??}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{there's nothing to talk about. get a good lawyer. you're suspended until your trial.}
