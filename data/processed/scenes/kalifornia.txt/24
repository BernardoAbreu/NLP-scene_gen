<L>__{interior brian and carrie's loft afternoon}
<A>__{brian enters the darkened loft interior.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i picked up some chinese. did you hear from the gallery?}
<A>__{brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series of erotic images being projected on the far wall. they are slides of carrie's photographic work. in regard to the nature and content of carrie's photographic work, her photographs address the sexual collision of opposites. "what if's." the subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly unlikely partners. studies in contract. moments of passion.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(tentative)}
<D>__{you got your slides back.}
<A>__{from across the room, he hears carrie's disembodied voice. he drifts toward the couch.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yeah, same old shit. too graphic... not suitable for mass consumption... one of those... i forget. who cares.}
<A>__{brian finds her slumped down on the couch. he sits down. she's got a drink in her hand. a bottle on her lap. she continues to click through the slides. as she rambles on, it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of something 90 proof.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{christ brian i'm dying here... you are too, you just don't know it yet. you're too busy working on that damned thesis... and, thing is... when you finally do finish it, it's just gonna get filed away on some shelf at the university library... then what?}
<A>__{brian can see she's upset. drowsy from the booze. he just watches her. listens. her words linger in his head.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{i thought you wanted to be a writer.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{...i do.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{then you can write anywhere. let's get out of here, while we still can.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no we can't. we can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to california now, right now, before it's too late.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{...just like that?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{just like that. load up the lincoln... point it west... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.}
<A>__{the bold graphic sexual photographs of carrie's continue to accentuate her comments.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{that's half the kick anyway. doing something you've never done before. experiencing something... different. something... unpredictable.}
<A>__{brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. he picks it up. opens it. inside, he finds the photographs carrie took at the warehouse. interested, he shuffles through them. he becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{...these are great.}
<A>__{he glances over to carrie... she's fallen asleep. he reaches over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.}
