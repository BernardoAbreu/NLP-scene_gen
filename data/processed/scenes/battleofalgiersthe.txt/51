<D>__{what number is it?}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{eight.}
<A>__{the man next to the assistant commissioner says:}

<P>__{(in sharp tone)}
<D>__{it does matter. go back, henry. let's go to number eight.}
<A>__{arnaud puts the gears in reverse; the car moves back quickly and passes the intersection: 16 ... 14 ... 12 ... 10 ... 8... it stops. arnaud puts it in neutral. with the motor still running, he presses the cigarette lighter on the dashboard. the assistant commissioner takes a large package that he is holding under his legs on the car floor. it is wrapped in pieces of newspaper. he lifts it forward. the man who is next to arnaud takes it, leans it against the back of his seat, touches it until he finds the right spot, unwraps it from that part, and straightens a small plastic tube which appears at the opening. it is a fuse.}
<C>__{arnaud}
<D>__{how long do you want the timing device?}
<C>__{friend}
<D>__{five minutes. give me a match ...}
<A>__{arnaud takes the cigarette lighter from the dashboard. the other man has opened the car door. he takes the lighter and touches it to the fuse which ignites immediately. the door of number eight is very near, almost directly opposite the car door. the man places the package in a shady area and returns to the car in a run. arnaud has already changed gears, releases the clutch, and the automobile shoots forward.}
