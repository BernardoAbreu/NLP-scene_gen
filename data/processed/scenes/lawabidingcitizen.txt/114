<L>__{interior city hall spiral staircase night}
<A>__{huge, descending seven floors, circles within circles dropping into darkness. nick and davies lead the way down. cantrell brings up the rear with his dog and cane...}
<C>__{spook }
<D>__{that's good there.}
<A>__{they freeze. nick and davies peer down. they start to make out a figure in the murky darkness one level below.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{which one of you is davies?}
<A>__{davies takes a step forward. the spook eases partially into the light flinty gaze, military style haircut.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{you must be well thought of, agent davies. i don't do this. but i was asked nicely by the right people. they briefed me on your problems with benson clyde.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what are we dealing with?}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{things i can neither confirm nor deny. things of which, if i'm asked, i will disavow any knowledge.}
<A>__{the guys trade a look. cantrell can't help chuckling.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<P>__{(to davies)}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me with this guy.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{he's not. tell me you grasp the implication of what i've said, or we're done here.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<P>__{(smile fades)}
<D>__{yeah. okay. i get it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what was clyde? some kind of spy?}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{spooks like me are a dime a dozen. clyde was a brain. he ran a think tank, inventing things for use in the field. ways to kill people.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{you need to get rid of somebody. it's not a situation where you can get close. what do you do?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ask clyde?}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{that's right. ask clyde. and he'd figure something out. gizmos, strategy. he was good at it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how good?}
<C>__{spook}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you play chess?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah. tournament level in college, matter of fact.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{in my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. a tournament level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? me, i think about ten steps ahead, so i'd take you in a game.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what about clyde?}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{off the charts. if you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. or fifty. he's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet.}
<P>__{(further into the light)}
<D>__{this cellmate he killed? you think that was random? bullshit. that was a pawn taken off the board. if i were you, i'd be trying to figure out what the move was.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have been. any thoughts?}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{top of my head? was the cellmate ever connected with this case? or with clyde? was anybody else in that facility? guards? cons? the janitor? any connection at all, no matter how remote. because if clyde says he has things in play, he does.}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{like what? he's locked up. what can he do?}
<C>__{spook}
<P>__{(gives him a look)}
<D>__{you're an average chess player, aren't you?}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{actually, i kind of suck.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{i can tell. but i like your tie.}
<C>__{davies}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{thank you. father's day.}
<C>__{spook}
<D>__{there's this tie we call it the albert, after albert desalvo. they tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. sounds crazy, but trust me it works. you put your tie on and all day long it slowly tightens. you don't even notice it's cutting off the blood flow to your brain. then you drop dead. brain dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that pointerior}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{clyde invented that.}
<A>__{the spook melts back into the shadows. the guys crane forward, trying to see. there's a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes...he's gone. the three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard. nick sits on a step. quiet looks are traded... ...and they all start taking off their ties...}
