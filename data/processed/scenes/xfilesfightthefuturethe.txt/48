<L>__{interior hallway outside opr hearing room day}
<A>__{mulder sits by himself in a chair, head down. when the door to the hearing room opens. mulder rising as a.d. skinner exits.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{sit down, they're still talking to agent scully.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{ they're asking her for a narrative. they want to know why she was in the wrong building.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{she was with me.}
<A>__{skinner studies mulder, shaking his head.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{you don't see what's going on here, do you?}
<P>__{(off mulder's look)}
<D>__{there's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas. lives have been lost. no suspects have been named. so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. that the fbi didn't do its job.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{and they want to blame us?}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{agent mulder we both know that if you and agent scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred }
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(grasping the irony)}
<D>__{but it's not the lives we saved. it's the lives we didn't.}
<C>__{skinner}
<P>__{(reciting the dictum)}
<D>__{ if it looks bad, it's bad for the fbi }
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{ if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. agent scully doesn't deserve this.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{she's in there right now saying the same thing about you.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i breached protocol. i broke contact with the s.a.c. i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. that you wanted to go back.}
<A>__{mulder doesn't get to respond, because the door opens again and agent scully exits. she looks like she's been through it.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(to skinner)}
<D>__{they're asking for you, sir.}
<A>__{skinner gives one last look to mulder, then re enters. leaving mulder and scully alone. scully wearing a pained look.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{all i told them was the truth.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{they're trying to divide us on this, scully. we can't let them.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{they have divided us, mulder. they're splitting us up.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i think you must have an idea. they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{they were the ones that put us together.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. but i think this goes deeper than that.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{this isn't about you, scully. they're doing this to me.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{they're not doing this, mulder.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi. when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. i felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. but it hasn't turned out that way. and now, if i were to be transferred to omaha, or wichita or some field office where i'm sure i could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. not after what i've seen and done.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're... quitting?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{there's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.}
<A>__{the door opens to the hearing room again now. a.d. skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{agent mulder. you're up.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(regretfully)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. good luck.}
<A>__{mulder rises. scully studying his poorly disguised hurt. before he turns and goes into the room. scully watching the door close behind him. her feelings poorly disguised, too.}
