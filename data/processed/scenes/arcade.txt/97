<L>__{exterior level nine, crumbling hong kong ghetto night}
<A>__{we're on a dark, crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which are caving in upon themselves. there is a flash of green light. alex and the boy suddenly appear on the street in a whirlwind of papers, sans motorcycle, but still sliding forward at a good thirty miles an hour. were it not for their armor, they'd be torn to shreds. they skid to a stop under a sputtering streetlight. alex and the boy are still screaming. anguish is the word for alex. she clutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet. beep! beep! beep! beep! beep!!!!!! it's her fucking wrist display again and time is fucking up! alex screams, pushed to the absolute breaking pointerior boom! once again the streets begin to vibrate as the screamer enters the level.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{it's here!!!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(manic)}
<D>__{oh god...oh god...}
<A>__{the streets impoverished people bustle back and forth everywhere. alex grabs the boy's hand and all but drags him down the darkened streets. it becomes a mad, blind dash through hell. she smashes into peddlers, stalls, tripping over or knocking down everything in her path... the shriek sonic boom of the screamer overwhelms everything else. with each level, it's gotten louder and louder. wind is tearing down the streets... a black clad figure spins out of the shadows, landing in front of them. it's a ninja, two swords spinning in its hands. instinctively, alex reaches to her side, and sure enough, there's a gun there now. she unholsters it and fires in a blind panic. blam! down goes the ninja #1, spouting blood from its chest. thwunk! thwunk!!! two throwing stars imbed themselves into alex's chest plate... ...and jesus fucking christ, ninjas are crawling out of the wood work! they dive out of the shadows, weapons spinning and glistening in the moonlight. throwing stars are flying like hail now, clinking! into the concrete walls behind alex and the boy...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{shit!!!}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{spins around, shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies. blam! blam! blam! ninjas fall right and left, but in no time, twice as many move in to take their place. they're like the hornet's nest of alien monsters, black clad shadows creeping towards them. a shot hits the streetlight above, casting a sputtering, strobing light over the whole scene and adding to the chaos. the world is shaking apart. it's the end of everything. it's flashes of light and noise, nightmares and blood, chaos heaped on chaos... alex fires her gun again and again and again... ...and in the midst of this mess, here comes the screamer again. it shoots down the street like a guided missile. alex stumbles. the boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...}
<C>__{the boy}
<D>__{come on!!!}
<A>__{alex is crying, hysterical. she turns and sees the screamer bearing down on her, just like nick did before her was ripped to shreds. the boy is yelling something. alex focuses...}
<C>__{the boy}
<D>__{the doorway! it's here!!!}
<B>__{the boy}
<A>__{is pulling back a manhole cover. blue light issues up from below. before alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole. alex has one last chance. she throws herself at the hole even as the screamer reaches her. a clawed hand wraps around her leg. alex fires into the hand. the hand is severed! she's falling! falling into darkness... "level ten bad brains"}
