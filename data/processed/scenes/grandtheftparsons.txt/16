<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no, you listen here. mister parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. which makes two of us.}
<A>__{the nurse turns and marches down the corridor. phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'admittance only to authorized hospital staff'.}
