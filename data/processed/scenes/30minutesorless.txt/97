<A>__{kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. she's been crying. she splashes water on her face, then enters a stall. the bathroom door opens and dwayne and jay enter. dwayne pulls something hairy from his pocket. inside the stall, kate reaches for some toilet paper...from underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty, masculine sneakers. her breath goes shallow. she takes out her cell, quietly opens it. she presses the first 9 in "911," but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull, electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.}

<D>__{why don't you just slide the phone under the door, so i don't have to kick it open and see you with your panties down.}
<A>__{kate slides the phone out. one of the sneakers crushes it. she gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out out of the stall. she gasps at the two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks. dwayne's gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants.}
