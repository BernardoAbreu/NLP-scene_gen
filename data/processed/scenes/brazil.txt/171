<L>__{interior information retrieval room}
<A>__{the bag comes off. sam finds himself strapped into an information retrieval chair. the camera tracks back frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an unbelievably vast room. the walls curve up and out of sight. the floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all strange light undulates beneath. the whole effect is one of total disorientation and overwhelming size. sam is desperately trying to take it in. next to the chair is a porcelain tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments. worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at hand. as the guards leave sam to take up their positions near the distant door they hand over documents to the white coated information retrieval officer.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{11 aft 607, sir.}
<A>__{they all sign the document which the i.r. officer retains after giving carbon copies to the guards. the guards then proceed to the door and take up positions on either side of it. the i.r. officer heads toward sam. we can now see he wears a mask. it is the face of the forces of darkness. a smiling baby doll face. sam sits, mesmerized, watching him approach. within fifteen or twenty yards of sam the i.r. officer comes to an abrupt halt. he seems to sway. after a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the impression that he may return to the door. he looks at the guards, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep breath and continues again towards sam, rather more briskly than before. sam watches, terrified and fascinated. the i.r. officer goes to the table which is covered with evil looking surgical type instruments he blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto the floor. he picks then up quickly and replaces them.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{the i.r. officer reacts to this as if he's been hit in the solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a coughing fit. he then picks up a nasty looking implement and advances on sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jack?... jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(hysterically from behind mask)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jack, i'm innocent! help me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bastard!!!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is all a mistake. jack, please take that mask off.}
<A>__{jack is very close to sam, he is shaking. he lifts up his mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you stupid bastard!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how could you do this to me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{help me, jack! i'm frightened!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you think i feel? you shit!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jack ...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pulling down mask)}
<D>__{shut up! this is a professional relationship!}
<A>__{jack comes at sam with the horrifying implement.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jack!! ... you can't ... no, don't!}
<A>__{sam's eyes widen in terror. from his pov we look up at jack approaching. the ceiling above and behind jack is suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the ceiling hole machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's pole", the commando like figure of mr tuttle gun in hand, leaps through the hole. tuttle is immediately followed by similar looking men with balaclavas, guerilla type clothing, and very efficient guns. jack is cut down. so are the two guards who have opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into the room. tuttle raps out into a walkie talkie}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{detonate!}
<A>__{from somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion which rocks the room. tuttle is already unstrapping sam.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{let's go!}
