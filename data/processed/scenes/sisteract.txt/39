<L>__{interior convent dining hall}
<A>__{a large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a crude iron chandelier. there is a long, central wooden table, with rough wooden benches. the convent's population is standing around the table in silence. there are about thirty nuns in all. mother superior moves to the head of the table, with christy following her. she motions for christy to stand at her right.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{good afternoon, sisters. i apologize for my tardiness. i would like you to welcome a new member of our order, sister mary clarence.}
<A>__{angle on sister mary robert, the nun standing beside christy. sister mary robert is naive and mouse like, but very sweet. she has only been at the convent a few years; she wears the simpler habit of a novice. she sneaks a look at christy. her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring at her hands.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{mary clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. she is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.}
<A>__{everyone sits, including christy. sister mary patrick, a nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. mary patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{yes, mary patrick?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.}
<A>__{angle on christy, looking thoroughly disgusted.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{as part of our welcome, i've had a little thought, just for fun. could we have our new friend offer today's blessing?}
<A>__{angle on the nuns, watching christy.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{very well. mary clarence, rise please.}
<A>__{christy stands up slowly, aghast.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a blessing? like, for lunch?}
<A>__{angle on mary patrick, beaming. she and the other nuns bow their heads.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(trying to recall a blessing)}
<D>__{for what we are about to receive...}
<A>__{so far, so good. mother superior has one eye open.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{may the lord... prepare us and... watch us and... walk through the valley and be our shepherd and... to the republic for which it stands... god bless us every one, hallowed be thy name. hallelujah. ave maria. boyardee. amen.}
<A>__{angle on the nuns, staring at christy. mother superior rises, very quickly.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{surely you are familiar with this practice, mary clarence. only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{silence? no talking? all day?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{until sundown.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(mouthing the words. without speaking aloud)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{christy reaches for a piece of bread.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{and mary clarence?}
<A>__{christy looks up.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{as a new member of our order, i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(mouthing the words)}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{a fast. to remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{no food?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(taking away christy's plate)}
<D>__{no food. not until sundown.}
<A>__{angle on christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching the other nuns eat.}
