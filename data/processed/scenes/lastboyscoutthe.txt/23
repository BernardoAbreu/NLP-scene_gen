<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{damn raccoon.}
<A>__{he sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. walks back out into the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{he kneels, looks under the bed. frowns. straightens and says, very conversationally:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{who's the guy in the closet?}
<A>__{sarah stops dead. spins and stares at him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that i'm a detective.}
<P>__{(lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{see, first i noticed how tense you were, but i let that pass. then i noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? so. why the steamy shower?}
<C>__{hallenbeck }
<D>__{because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. tah dah. please, no applause.}
<A>__{a silence hangs between them. sarah just stares. shakes her head.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{well, nothing changes. you're still a lunatic.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{mmmmm. i'm sorry, honey, i don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{please leave. i have to get dressed.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{it's okay, i've seen you naked. so, apparently, has someone else. what's his name?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you want me to open the closet, joe? huh? you want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, i will throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{is this a trick question?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i will do it, joe. okay? and then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? huh??}
<A>__{an awkward pause. finally hallenbeck scowls and says:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{no. we won't open the door.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{nope. door stays shut. instead, what i'm gonna do is...}
<P>__{(he scoops up the .38)}
<D>__{... i'm gonna count to three, and then i'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. one.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{if you shoot up my house, joe, i will make you eat that gun.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{two. the truth is a beautiful thing.}
<A>__{he cocks the hammer. arm extended, hand rock steady.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{call your shrink, joe. i still have the number. call him and tell him you're losing it, i cannot fucking deal with you like this !}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{three. last chance.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{joe, dammit !}
<A>__{he sighs. starts to pull the trigger. and sarah screams }
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{jesus, no !}
<A>__{and grabs the gun. everything freezes. she looks at him. he looks at her. understanding occurs.}
<B>__{closet door}
<A>__{swings slowly open, then... and out steps a man in a bathrobe. compact. wiry. hair still soaking wet. none other than mike miller, joe's early morning phone call. we know this because joe says:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hello, mike. keeping her warm for me?}
<A>__{the gun barrel does not waver. not an inch.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{easy, joe. don't do nothing dumb.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{how as she, mike? on your finger scale, how was my wife...?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it just happened, joe. it just happened.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you call me from here this morning?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{she said you were in vegas. i was gonna leave a message on the machine.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{when you found out i was back. why didn't you split?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{she said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{normally i wouldn't.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(stares at him)}
<D>__{you knew?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i suspected. so how about it, mike? on a scale of one to ten. how was she?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{how long? mmm. i'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you gotta understand }
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i know, i know, it just happened. it was an accident. sure. you tripped. you said, 'whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. gee, mrs. h., i'm sorry, just isn't my week. sure, mike. happen to anybody.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't gotta understand anything.}
<A>__{sarah speaks then. head down. eyes averted.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{put the gun down.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hmmm? oh, right, the gun.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you're right, sarah, i'm acting nuts.}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger. the shot is deafening in the closed room. mike miller screams and clutches at himself. the bullet goes high and wide. over his head. on the wall is a framed wedding photo. the twin of the one in hallenbeck's office. the bullet strikes it dead center. blows it to pieces. silence. the tinkle of glass hitting the floor. hallenbeck turns. regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{where was darian?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{she stayed at cindy's last night.}
<A>__{he nods. turns and waves the gun at miller.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{let's take a walk, buddy.}
