<L>__{interior laboratory on peter and ray}
<A>__{they stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the o.s. egon. ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over it. slimer hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a dog. he finally dives right into it.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{it's your night to take out the trash.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.}
<B>__{angle on egon}
<A>__{he's busy testing his weather balloon a large, pink bubble half the size of the room. he moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon rises.}
<C>__{egon}
<P>__{(preoccupied; through above)}
<D>__{be with you in ...}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{...one minute, fifty three seconds.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{peter and ray exchange pained glances. peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while ray stumbles around, his vision blocked. pan with them as they move toward door when egon's weather balloon suddenly lowers into frame. they bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash bags flying.}
<C>__{peter and ray}
<P>__{(ad lib reactions as they bounce off balloon)}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{peter stumbles backwards and lands butt first right on one of the bags. slimer squeals from within it.}
<C>__{slimer }
<P>__{(big muffled squeal)}
<A>__{then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body flat as a frisbee.}
<B>__{slimer}
<A>__{shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pissed; sarcastic)}
<D>__{thanks, slimer. i really needed that!}
<C>__{slimer}
<D>__{sorreee!}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{ray helps peter up as the telephone rings and rings.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{egon! the phone!}
<B>__{on egon}
<A>__{the ringing phone is right beside him on the workbench.}
<C>__{egon}
<P>__{(preoccupied with remote controls)}
<D>__{in a minute, ray.}
<B>__{angle on winston}
<A>__{he enters with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and wearing an apron.}
<C>__{winston}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{nevermind, egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself.}
<P>__{(picks up phone)}
<D>__{ghostbusters central.}
<C>__{voice over phone}
<P>__{(excited chatter)}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{calm down... where are you?...}
<P>__{(a beat as he listens)}
<D>__{we'll be right there.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{peter and ray again have their arms full of trash bags. even slimer is dragging one.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{ready for this one? some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hey, even a half baked false alarm sounds better than doing egon's chores.}
<P>__{(he drops trash bags)}
<D>__{let's roll!}
<A>__{ray and slimer also abandon their trash bags and exit with peter and winston.}
<B>__{rear view on egon}
<A>__{still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.}
<C>__{egon}
<D>__{i think i've finally perfected it. watch this, guys.}
<P>__{(a beat, he looks around over shoulder)}
<D>__{guys?}
