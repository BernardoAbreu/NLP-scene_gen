<A>__{burners' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, goines, dragging the body right over todd's body. as goines' shoe drags over todd's face, todd's eyes flicker stupidly. then goines' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin. todd blinks, fighting for consciousness. where is he? he moves his head...}

<A>__{the burners, silhouetted by flames, feed goines' body to the furnace. close on the flames as goines' body is consumed by raging flames. angle on the burners trudging to the bin. they reach in blindly for whatever's nexterior tugging with effort, they struggle the clumsy object over the rim, and let it fall to the floor. it's a mattress! communicating with a look, the first burner drags the mattress toward the fire while the second burner reaches again into the bin. the second burner frowns through the visor, struggles with something, frowns, wrestles with it. finally, with great effort, he pulls out a big carton that immediately spills old magazines on him. disgusted, he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse littered floor toward the furnaces. angle on his feet, as the second burner struggles toward the fire, stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable in the flickering firelight. he passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it. the sign says nonflammable waste disposal...and the trail of blood leads to that bin!}
