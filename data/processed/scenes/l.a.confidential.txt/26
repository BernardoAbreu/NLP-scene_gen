<L>__{exterior hollywood liquor night}
<A>__{bud exits with his booze, heads for the car. something catches his eye. a woman in the rear passenger seat of a new cadillac. susan lefferts. both her eyes are black. bud starts over. the case on his hip, he motions for her to roll down the window. the driver's side door opens and bodyguard turner "buzz" meeks menaces his way out.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{get lost why don't you?}
<A>__{meeks stops short as bud shoves his badge in meeks' face. setting the case on the car's hood, bud spins meeks around, pats him down. he finds a .38 in a shoulder holster.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{i got a license for that.}
<A>__{bud removes meeks' wallet, checks the id.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{cut me some slack. i used to be a cop.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{turner meeks? never heard of you.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(exiting store)}
<D>__{we just call him buzz.}
<A>__{bud raps on susan's window with his badge. it comes down.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{beside her, a man leans over. pierce patchett, seen before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being chauffeured. like fdr, he smokes his cigarette in a holder.}
<C>__{patchett}
<D>__{she's fine.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(menacing)}
<D>__{i'm not asking you.}
<A>__{patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice. as he stares impatiently at bud, bud looks back to susan.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{somebody hit you?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{it's not what you think.}
<A>__{bud looks to see lynn bracken moving to the driver's door.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what is it then?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you got the wrong idea, mister. i'm fine.}
<A>__{susan laughs. patchett eases back into the shadows.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(getting in the car)}
<D>__{but it's nice to know you care.}
<A>__{bud considers meeks' gun license, then hands him back the .38 and wallet. lifting his booze, bud watches meeks get back in the car. stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.}
<C>__{stensland}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{for an odd moment, stensland and meeks lock eyes.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{stensland}
<D>__{seen him around. he used to be a cop.}
