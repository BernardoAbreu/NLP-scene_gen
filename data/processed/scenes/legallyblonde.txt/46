<L>__{exterior law school quad benches day later}
<A>__{emmett — a shy and quirkily handsome 28 year old who could pass for younger — sits on a bench, going over some papers. he looks up and spots elle — sitting across from him — looking traumatized.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{do they just — put you on the spot like that? like, all the time?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{the professors? yeah, they tend to do that. socratic method.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{and if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{you have stromwell.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{did she do that to you, too?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{no, but she made me cry once. not in class — i waited until i got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls — or you know, your whatevers}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(stricken)}
<D>__{neat.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{don't worry. it gets better. who else do you have?}
<A>__{elle looks at her schedule.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{donovan, royalton and levinson.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{speak up in donovan's class. he likes people with an opinion. sit in the back for royalton. he tends to spit when he talks about products liability.}
<A>__{elle makes a face. he smiles. liking her.}
<C>__{emmett }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and make sure you read the footnotes in levinson's class. that's where all her exam questions come from.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{wow. i ' m glad i met you.}
<A>__{she smiles at him, grateful.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{oh, and getting one of stromwell's daily quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid term. but you didn't hear it from me.}
<A>__{students trickle out of the building.}
<D>__{elle " .:. are you a third year?}
<A>__{warner walks up, behind emmett, interrupting.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{elle looks up, pure adoration on her face.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{hi!}
<A>__{emmett rises and walks off.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{good luck.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{thanks again for your help!}
<A>__{warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{so — uh — how was your first class?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{fine. except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor. but no biggie. you're here now.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(perky)}
<D>__{how was your summer?}
<A>__{she pats the bench beside her. he doesn't move.}
<C>__{warner}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{good. good.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{do anything exciting?}
<A>__{a female hand snakes around warner's chest from behind. warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her.}
<C>__{warner}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{urn, hey, have you met sarah?}
<A>__{sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to elle, full of contempt.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hi. sarah knottingham.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(to warner; horrified)}
<D>__{you know her?}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{she's —}
<A>__{sarah jumps in.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{— i ' m his fiancee.}
<A>__{elle stares at her. sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown hair behind her ear and there it is — the rock.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{i ' m sorry, i just hallucinated.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. we got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.}
<A>__{elle looks stricken. sarah gives her a smug smile.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{warner told me all about you. you're famous at our club.}
<A>__{she says it in a way that is anything but flattering. in fact, it's completely condescending.}
<C>__{sarah }
<P>__{(continuing; pointedly)}
<D>__{but he didn't tell me you'd be here.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{i didn't know —}
<A>__{elle looks from warner to sarah.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{she rushes off. sarah watches her go, a smug grin on her face.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(to warner)}
<D>__{i thought you said she was pretty.}
