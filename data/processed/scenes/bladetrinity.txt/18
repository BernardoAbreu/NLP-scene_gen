<L>__{interior blade's charger night}
<A>__{blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous. the charger surges forward as stone and campbell fall back, veering to either side. now blade is ahead of them. he checks their position in his rear view mirror, then stands on the brakes }
<L>__{exterior busy street night}
<A>__{the charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat, causing stone and campbell to rear end blade. the vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like crash test dummies. stone smashes through blade's back windshield, continuing into the front seat while campbell tumbles over blade's roof and across his hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield wipers at the last minute.}
