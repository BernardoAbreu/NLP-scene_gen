<D>__{this place is swept twice a day. i learned that in miami in '85. then the u.s. shut down the whole caribbean, but it's a big game of wack a mole. knock it down in miami, it pops up here. and san diego is so much more relaxing.}

<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{helena, if i had it i would give it to you, but i don't have that kind of money.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{arnie, help me. doesn't anyone owe us money?}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{yes, i told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. there's too much heat on carl.}

<A>__{it takes a great effort for arnie not to answer.}
