<L>__{interior von doom conference room night}
<A>__{doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to the opening scene. those mysterious crates loom in shadows. he wears a green hood, and metal mask over his scarred face. doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{chemistry 101, part two. what happens to rubber when it's super cooled?}
<A>__{we now see what he sees: reed sits in a chair with tubes injected into his skin freezing him solid! ultra cold vapor coats him. doom steps closer, a sadistic smile. reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{allow me.}
<A>__{he presses down on one of reed's fingers, which makes a horrific cracking sound. reed's face twists with pain.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{painful...?}
<A>__{doom seems to enjoy every crack. he leans closer.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{you don't know the meaning of the word.}
<A>__{doom lets up on reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out a military issue rocket launcher. he aims at the city skyline, locking onto his target: johnny storm.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{but you will.}
<A>__{johnny's heat signature glows. the screen flashes: target acquired. doom looks back at reed, his launcher aimed casually over his shoulder.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{flame off.}
<A>__{boooom! he fires without looking! a missile blasts into the sky. the missile lights up the dark night beginning its wide turn towards its target.}
