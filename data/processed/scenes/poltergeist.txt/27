<D>__{my fault. my fault.}
<A>__{diane turns on the light in their closet and cracks open the door. carol anne relaxes and waves good night to her fish. robbie looks over at the rocking chair by the bureau. sitting straight up is clown doll. it is almost the size of robbie. its stare is devilish and its smile is just a little too broad for comedy. robbie gets up and without looking at the doll, throws a plaid shirt over its head. he climbs back into bed, outlined by a blue flash from the window.}
