<A>__{we hear the applause and whistles echoing in the distance. sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door. we see a photograph of sonny, and also one of their wedding. a moment goes by, and then tom hagen enters, closing the door behind him. we begin to hear senator geary's amplified voice resounding over the lake. hagen moves to sandra. she takes him in her arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.}
