<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{we hear a toilet flush. zack emerges from the bathroom to find burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{no, stay for a sec.}
<A>__{burke sprays more cologne on his hand.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{smell this. what does it smell like?}
<A>__{zack shakes his head, doesn't know.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{ck one. but it's not.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i get this for a quarter what that stuff costs.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it's nice.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he sprays some on zack's hands, who didn't want it. while burke turns to get some underwear, zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(re: bedspread)}
<D>__{it's down. so is the liner.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it is soft.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{get on.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<A>__{burke pushes zack back flat the bed.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{did you hear that?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{hear what?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{exactly. individually wrapped springs. top quality.}
<A>__{burke climbs onto the bed beside him.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldn't feel it.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{i sure wouldn't.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so, zack. would you say you're open to new things?}
