<T>__{to:}
<L>__{exterior: city hall, an autumn day...}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{"but, ultimately, the complaint was found, wasn't it?}
<T>__{continuous cut to:}
<A>__{wide angle on courtroom: jamey collins on the stand (day).}
<C>__{jamey}
<D>__{yes. we found a copy. it been incorrectly filed...}
<A>__{title: " plaintiff's case, day ten. "}
<C>__{jamey }
<D>__{we got it to court on time.}
<A>__{angle on the jury: several jurors write in notebooks like the marine's; he's been handing them out... joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. when he glances at andrew, it's with irritation.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{has a file ever disappeared like that before? vanished into thin air, all of a sudden, only to reappear in the nick of time?}
<A>__{jamey answers nervously:}
<C>__{jamey}
<D>__{i've never known that to happen before. no.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(fires this question)}
<D>__{did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally on purpose?}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will rephrase.}
<P>__{(to jamey)}
<D>__{did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?}
<C>__{jamey}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<A>__{joe stands, staring at jamey. too long. jamey squirms.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you a homosexual?}
<C>__{jamey}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{joe pressing forward, toward jamey.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{c'mon, mr. collins. are you homosexual? you know, gay?}
<A>__{the courtroom erupts: activists booing joe, wheeler's crowd expressing outrage, jurors looking confused. andrew takes in the commotion, as the judge bangs his gavel.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{hold it, hold it!}
<A>__{andrew trains his attention on joe.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{objection! where has this come from?! suddenly counsel is attacking his own witness. mr. collins' sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{i said, hold it!}
<P>__{(the courtroom quiets)}
<D>__{mr. miller. could you kindly share with me exactly what's going on in your brain, because i don't have a clue at the moment.}
<A>__{joe faces andrew, also curious to know what joe's up to.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your honor, everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference, sexual orientation, whatever you want to call it. they're looking at me, and wondering about it...}
<P>__{(looking at andrew)}
<D>__{they're looking at mr. beckett, and wondering about it. they're looking at mr. wheeler and wondering about it. they might even be looking at you and wondering about it. so, let's get it out in the open. let's talk about what this case is really about: the general public's hatred... our loathing, our fear of homosexuals.}
<A>__{dead silence while the judge thinks it over.}
<B>__{close on andrew.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{very good.}
<B>__{close on belinda conine. close on charles wheeler. close on miguel. close on walter kenton. close on bob seidman. close on the marine juror.}
<A>__{close on jamey collins, sweating bullets on the stand.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{in this courtroom, mr. miller, justice is blind. to matters of race, creed, color, religion. and sexual orientation.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{with all due respect, your honor... we don't live in this courtroom, do we?}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{no. we don't... however, as regards this witness, i'm going to sustain the defense's objection.}
