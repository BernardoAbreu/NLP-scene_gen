<L>__{exterior on the barge continuous day}
<A>__{the current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our first good look at the incredible}
<B>__{aviary.}
<A>__{it's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon. in all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable hubris. catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they were caught in.}
<L>__{exterior down river day later}
<A>__{yanking the starter rope one final time, paul finally gets the engine to turn over, puttering along. amanda is beside him, bailing water.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{my own kid was right in front of me and i didn't do a damn thing.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you couldn't have made that jump.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i should have tried. it should have been me on that beach back there, not billy.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{how would you have helped eric?}
<P>__{(he can't answer)}
<D>__{he needs you, paul. he needs us.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he could have died.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{but he didn't. and neither did you. and i'm glad about that.}
<B>__{up on the bow}
<A>__{grant is beside eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight of billy's death.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{do you have any kids?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no. although i've studied them in the wild.}
<A>__{eric looks over, not sure what that means.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{i have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i want to be an astronaut.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{see, i was the opposite. i never understood why anyone would want to go into space. it's so dangerous. you do one thing wrong and you're dead. the astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. and truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{but then you never get to go in space.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{exactly. the difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. to be able to touch them. that's what billy wanted to do.}
<A>__{the barge starts to round a bend. on the bow, grant and eric are the fist to see something remarkable. eric gasps, unprepared. we don't know yet what they see.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{i can blame the people who made this island. but i can't blame the people who want to see it. to study it.}
<A>__{at the rear of the barge, paul just now sees what's ahead. awe struck, he slows the motor and motions for amanda to take a look. and so do we.}
<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{the setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with dinosaurs. we see armored ankylosaurs with clubbed tails. duck billed corythosaurs. we float under the gigantic, arching necks of eighty foot brachiosaurs. with the mist from the river and the play of light, we're witnessing a kind of primal eden.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{how's a boy suppose to resist this?}
