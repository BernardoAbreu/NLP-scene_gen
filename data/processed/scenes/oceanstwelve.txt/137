<A>__{isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the newspaper, enjoying her vacation. she looks up and stops cold. rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her. she stares at him. can't believe it. the brazenness. the audacity of this guy. rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in italian. finally, isabel just can't help herself. she gets up and walks over to rusty's table.}
