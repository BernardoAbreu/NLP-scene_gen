<L>__{interior bertie's study night}
<A>__{bertie, in despair and grief, has been describing to elizabeth what happened.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the look in mother's eyes, it was...ghastly.}
<A>__{he notices something on his desk, the record logue made. pov: the label his master's voice stares up at him. he releases his emotions in an outburst of anger.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{what's this bloody thing doing here?!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{bertie...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the man was a total fraud!}
<A>__{he picks up the record and is about to smash it against the edge of his desk, then realizes the mess that would make and tosses it into a waste paper basket. then changes his mind.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{would you like to hear?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not particularly.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{well i think you should. you should know what goes on. telling me he could help me read flawlessly. lying bastard! listen to this babble!}
<A>__{bertie takes the record from the trash and walks to a victrola stand, lifts the arm, places the steel needle, expecting to hear his stuttering voice. instead, what he hears is flawless and flowing:}
<C>__{bertie's recorded voice}
<D>__{"to be, or not to be, that is the question: whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?"}
<P>__{(the needle sticks)}
<C>__{bertie's recorded voice }
<D>__{"...sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? and by opposing end them? and by opposing..."}
<A>__{bertie lifts the needle. he and his wife stare at each other; there are tears in her eyes. the roar of a huge delirious crowd is heard, growing in volume. the roar becomes chillingly recognizable: "zeig heil! zeig heil! zeig heil!"}
