<L>__{exterior museum day (later)}
<A>__{the fire is out. the once proud building is now a smoldering pile of rubble. locals stand in small groups. chris wanders through the ruins as firemen mop up. he picks something out of the char. the map of the mines. almost completely burned. soaked with water. he stares at it for a heavy beat. all that remains of his legacy. sam steps up.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe she got out.}
<A>__{sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(devastated)}
<D>__{she was cooking. the stove was broken.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why don't you come home with me? we'll get you cleaned up.}
<A>__{chris hesitates for a moment. and then he lets the map fall. he walks out of the ruins with sam. mike stands off to the side. he spots something near the edge of the ruins. he goes over to pick it up. it's a piece of arachnid exoskeleton. a spider's leg. big. very big. travis the fire chief warns him away.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{get away from there, mike!}
<A>__{mike hurries clear with his prize. he puts it on the ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale of the leg.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{holy god...}
<A>__{mike looks around for his mom. he sees her driving off in the cop car with chris.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{mom! wait!}
