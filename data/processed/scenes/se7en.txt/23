<L>__{interior indoor fruit stand night}
<A>__{the front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy sidewalk and street. a transparent plastic canopy frames the entrance. a strange man, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy. he wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious. tracy and mills look together over the piles of fruits and vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it was okay. i mean... it was certainly better than yesterday. i think somerset and i came to a small understanding...}
<A>__{mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch apart to illustrate.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{...about this big.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{he sounds interesting.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{he is that, if nothing else.}
<A>__{mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from tracy's arm. he goes to check out the carrots. tracy looks up from heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance. the strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes glassy. customers come and go, paying him no mind. mills notices tracy's interest. he keeps comparing carrots.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{we started a big homicide case today. i will spare you the grisly details.}
<A>__{the strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store with a crooked grin.}
<C>__{strange man}
<D>__{name that tune? anybody name that tune? name that tune...}
<A>__{the man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{it's... it's like they emptied all the insane asylums into the streets.}
<A>__{she looks back to the heads of lettuce.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{that's what it's like. like they just gave up, and let everyone out.}
<A>__{mills nods, his back to tracy.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{there are a lot of frightening people in this city.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{there are a lot of frightening people in the world.}
<A>__{tracy looks again to the strange man.}
<C>__{strange man}
<D>__{name that tune? anybody name that tune?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{it seems worse than philadelphia, because everything is pushed right up against you. in your face.}
<A>__{mills edges past tracy towards the front of the store, tries to be pleasant.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{listen, honey. i don't want to fight tonight. okay? can we just go one night without fighting about something?}
<A>__{he looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i'm not trying to start a fight.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{how am i trying to start a fight?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{we're here now. okay. are we supposed to pack it all in and go back? how are we going to do that?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{do i have to act like i love this place? is that what a "good wife" would do?}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(doleful)}
<D>__{there's a lot of pressure on me... i...}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{and, there's a lot of pressure on me. i'm here with you.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i know. i know...}
<A>__{mills steps towards the open air entrance. he's watching something. the strange man is still heard offscreen. tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of rice, her back to mills.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i'm not going to close my eyes and block everything out, david. i'm not going to act like you delivered us to some sort of paradise. i can't...}
<A>__{she gets the rice and turns. mills is not there. she sighs, angry, looks around. she walks towards the entrance and sees him tracy's p.o.v. the street in front of the stand, mills has run to the corner of the sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane. the elderly woman smiles up at mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the curb and across the street. he talks to her as they go.}
