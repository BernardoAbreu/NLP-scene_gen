<L>__{interior anderson's office}
<A>__{anderson looks up sharply at the sound of a knock on his door. every normal sound seems grotesquely amplified, the traffic outside, his own breathing. his senses are on overload. the door begins to open. a stockinged leg is the first thing anderson sees. his secretary, angela.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{she hesitates before fully entering the room, anderson grabs at the incriminating disc. he sees his eyes reflected in its alloy surface. he pushes the disc deep into his pants pocket. somehow he finds his voice.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{come in. angela.}

<C>__{angela}
