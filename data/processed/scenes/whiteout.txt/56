<A>__{she's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. an old, wrinkled faced russian man slowly lowers her wounded hand pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of water next to her. her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights. a huge bruise runs across her arm.}

<A>__{he flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.}
<C>__{carrie}
