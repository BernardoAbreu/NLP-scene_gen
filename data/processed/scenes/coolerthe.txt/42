<L>__{interior shelly's office night}
<A>__{shelly enters to find larry seated behind his desk. larry immediately leaps to his feet, phony apologetic grin. nicky and marty are lounging on shelly's sofa. shelly's gaze is drawn to a table in the middle of the room. there's something on it, covered in a plastic sheet. he raises a "what gives?" eyebrow.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{shelly, i hope you don't mind...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what's going on, nicky?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i'm sorry we didn't say nothing about this earlier... but the deal wasn't closed yet.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{don't worry, shelly, you're gonna love it.}
<A>__{nicky gestures to larry. larry whisks the plastic sheet off the table... ...to reveal an impressive scale model of a redesigned shangri }
<B>__{la hotel and casino.}
<A>__{the model boasts huge snow capped himalayan peaks a la "lost horizon," surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and casino. a matterhorn like rollercoaster traverses the mountain top. gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise to raise the bar on las vegas opulence. we're looking at a hundred million dollar investment easy.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the new shangri la hotel and casino. we break ground on her in six months.}
<A>__{off shelly's startled expression }
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking? where's she gonna go? you need space to expand, right? well, that's been taken care of. we're now the proud owners of the golden frontier next door.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(gesturing to the model)}
<D>__{she's perfect. three floors of gaming, imax theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, you name it. she'll pay for herself in three years, and then it's easy money.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{isn't she great, shell?}
<A>__{shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner mounting the scaffolding. we see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming pool.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{in "lost horizon," these people, their plane crashes in the himalayas and they get rescued and taken to this utopia in the mountains. shangri la. it's beautiful. the place is completely isolated. untouched by the outside world. there's no war, no greed, no bullshit... time is slowed down. people, they don't age. it's... paradise. that's what shangri la is. paradise.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yeah, we've all seen the movie. and your point is?}
<A>__{shelly whirls around, yells:}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you don't fuck with paradise! all'a ya!}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, jesus, c'mon, shelly. we're not trying to fuck with it. we're trying to make it better.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{how... how, nicky, could it be any better? right now it's perfect. it's the last of its kind. it's pure... and this.}
<P>__{(points to the model; weary)}
<D>__{...this is just... it's a mockery. an insult. trying to make something of it that it isn't.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what are you talking about? it's right outta the movie?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{whose talking about a fuckin' movie? this ain't a fuckin' movie. this is my life. this is my house of worship. you people are shittin' on all that's sacred to me.}
<A>__{a tense silence ensues. nicky, larry and marty exchange looks.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(tired laugh)}
<D>__{i got just one question? where you gonna be when they decide to change it back? when the people, they come looking for the real vegas, from before all this epcott center bullshit. who's gonna it give it to them? you guys? i don't think so. you know who? the same fucks who started this shit in the first place. it's all gonna come full circle and bite you in the ass. mark my words.}
<A>__{shelly falls silent. massages his forehead. shit, that wasn't the way to handle it. nicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to shelly, places a hand on his shoulder. shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you make some good points, shelly. maybe it'll swing back the other way, who knows? but the smart money suggests we roll the dice. i'm not gonna bullshit you; naturally there's gonna be a lot of restructuring in the months to come, but i want you to know, you'll always have a place with us.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{where's that? behind the bar?}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{behind the bar, that's a good one.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i think you should take some time and think things through. all this, it's a lot to digest, y'know.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{speaking of things to digest, i'm starving. how's that buffet they got in the valley of the blue moon? you recommend their prime rib, shell?}
<A>__{shelly stares right through marty. choke and die on it, motherfucker.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{it's food.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, my arteries can use a workout. lead us to the trough, shell.}
<A>__{shelly nods at nicky, then shifts his gaze to larry. larry's all smiles. he steps forward to join them, his hand dropping down and caressing the surface of shelly's desk behind him. a subtle gesture not lost on shelly. shelly mentally unloads a full chamber into larry's chest. returns the smile.}
