<L>__{interior nasa briefing hall day}
<A>__{...and join hundreds of journalists in the audience. lights dim. in front, face lit from below at a podium, senior scientist harold ernest, 60s, head of the space exploration office.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{as many of you may know, in 2032 the space exploration office began a series of unmanned flights to mars.}
<A>__{the entire wall behind him, 40 feet by 100 feet, is a vid screen. as he speaks the images appear. not as if he's narrating to the footage, but as if it's voice activated.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{it had been determined by 2020 that mars harbored no life. although beginning with the same resources as earth four billion years ago, mars didn't support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last 300 million years. nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life.}
<A>__{exactly as he describes it, it occurs. (icecaps melt, temperature gradients rise, etc.). in the audience are hundreds of journalists watching.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{it was, however, concluded that mars was receptive to terraforming. if we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further. we could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit. to do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere. resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the martian atmosphere. in the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes. the terraforming was initially successful.}
<A>__{we see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the martian surface. algae blooms. red, orange, green, black, burnt sienna. every color you can imagine. valleys covered with color.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{the average temperature on mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades. the oxygen content began to increase as well. and then eleven months ago, the o2 on mars suddenly began to decline. soon after, all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning. we have no idea what's gone wrong. we need to know why. man's very destiny may lie in the answer.}
<A>__{the color on mars ebbs away.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{we are about to embark on the greatest mission of human exploration. by using a number of heavy lift launch vehicles and a modified close lunar cargo ship, we have created a vessel capable of journeying to mars.}
<A>__{we see construction being rushed along and hab 1 (a kind of big space rv) landing and deploying on mars as }
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{three months ago, hab 1, an unmanned living environment, was launched. in nine days ares 1, our first manned mission, will be sent to mars. ladies and gentlemen, i give you the first men and women to travel beyond the reach of earth to the next planet in the solar system.}
<A>__{light comes up on the crew.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{lt. commander katherine bowman will supervise the flight component of our mission. commander bowman has 2200 hours in space. she will be assisted by pilot and mission specialist ed santen.}
<P>__{(next)}
<D>__{and we're pleased to have dr. bud chantilas come out of retirement as our chief science officer. bud brings a view as a generalist few can offer, with a nobel in chemistry and a macgregor in molecular biology. he was off getting another ph.d., this time in...}
<P>__{(checks)}
<D>__{...theology when we asked him to join us.}
<P>__{(next)}
<D>__{dr. chip pettengill, who until recently has held the number two position in the terraforming office, is an expert in extremophile and cryptoendolithic biology.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{dr. cooper burchenal, late of western biotech has left the private sector to help us.}
<P>__{(last)}
<D>__{and we are also joined by robert gallagher.}
<A>__{santen turns to kate and quietly mutters.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{the janitor.}
<A>__{his mike was on. it echoes across the room. but gallagher's too quick to let him try to apologize anyhow.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{that's technically space janitor.}
<A>__{crowd likes this. gallagher continues }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{when the toilet breaks 80 million miles from the nearest hardware store, they call me. actually, they called me now 'cause then would be too late.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{to be more precise, mr. gallagher is the mechanical systems engineer. we're glad to have him along.}
<A>__{ernest moves on quickly.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{we stand on the threshold of the most triumphant moment of the millennium. science has brought us here, and science will take us further.}
