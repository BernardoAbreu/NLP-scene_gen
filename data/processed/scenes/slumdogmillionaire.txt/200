<A>__{the line goes dead in latika's hand. she stares down at the phone. the bemused family are still eying her like an alien. she smiles at them and goes out. the traffic on the road is still grid locked. she starts walking, faster and faster. then she breaks into a run.}

<A>__{javed is banging on the door. salim gets up from where he has been praying. he climbs into the bath which is full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money. he reaches across for the pistol and picks it up. smiles slightly as javed smashes down the door, pulls the trigger and shoots javed. he falls onto the floor, dead. but the thug right behind him shoots salim in the chest. he lies back in the bath, the faintest trace of a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of jamal on the tv.}
