<L>__{interior restaurant interview day}
<D>__{we're in a smart restaurant. george has his back to the room and is eating with his chauffeur. peppy comes into the restaurant and comes to sit just behind george. they are back to back. she is with several young men, two of whom are journalists and they are interviewing her. title card: your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow and yet you're already the new darling of hollywood! how do you explain that? she starts by bursting into laughter, which draws george's attention. he turns round to listen to the rest of peppy's answer. title card: i don't know, maybe it's because i talk. and people hear me. she continues talking, obviously happy that people are interested in her. she doesn't see george smiling behind her. title card: people are sick to death of those old actors who pull faces to make themselves understood. she continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth. behind her, george's smile vanishes. title card: anyway, it's normal for the young to take over from the old, that's life. make way for youth! george is hurt. he gets up and, before he leaves, gestures silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is take it. she watches him leave and immediately regrets what she's just said.}
