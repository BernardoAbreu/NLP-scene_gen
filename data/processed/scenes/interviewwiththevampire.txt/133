<L>__{interior movie theatre night}
<A>__{a deco cinema of the twenties. louis and armand, dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and there, a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise, for the first time in two hundred years...}
<A>__{on the screen, murnau's "sunrise", in black and white. we see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of movies, in black and white.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and what sunrises! seen as the human eye could never see them. we would sit in the dark, night after night among nameless humans, entranced with the miracle of light. silver at first, then as the years progressed in tones of purple, red and my long lost blue...}
<A>__{the sunrises continue, in color now, and the backgrounds in them change to the fifties.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and in time parted. we had become so alike, we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more.}
<A>__{the lights come up in a different theatre. louis sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed in the clothes of the fifties. he rises, exits with the others.}
