<A>__{a large assembly of women. guards calling out names from a list. as each woman steps out of line, a guard unceremoniously brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes. new columns are formed.}

<A>__{schindler, standing at the end of the platform stone faced, watches the women whose names he is "stuck on," whose clothes are slashed with red paint, climbing onto the cattle cars. as the cars fill, a train on another track arrives. the "fresh" ones schindler turned down. as the gates are closed on the women's cars, the gates of the others are opened and the people spill out. a horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the engines. one of schindler's women, locked in, has seen her son among those coming down off the train on the opposing track. another cry erupts, and another, another, as the women spot their children, confiscated from the brinnlitz factory, brought here. schindler becomes aware of what's happening and, passing over other children, tries to corral these particular boys, many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing their tortured cries with their own. schindler manages to gather them together, the fifteen or twenty boys, and, in the middle of the crowded platform, appears to a guard:}

<D>__{these are mine. they're on the list. these are my workers. they should be on the train.}
<A>__{he points across to the women's train, then down to the boys.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{they're skilled munition workers. they're essential.}
<A>__{the guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious brook around him. these are essential workers?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{they're boys.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{schindler is nodding his head, trying to think. the women are shrieking their sons' names. the guard, who heard it all, every excuse imaginable, is just turning away when schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{their fingers. they polish the insides of shell casings. how else do you expect me to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing?}
<A>__{the guard stares at him dumbly. this he hasn't heard.}
