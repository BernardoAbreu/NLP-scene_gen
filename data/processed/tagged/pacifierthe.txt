<A>__{the camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath the surface.}
<L>__{exterior pacific ocean continuous}
<A>__{the droning of engines becomes less pronounced. foam from the boat and skis bubbles. calm. then from out of nowhere five navy seals wearing re breathers appear, in neat formation like the blue angels. jet propelled backpacks push the seals through the water. the lead seal: shane wolfe, points upwards. all eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above. from his belt, shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and fires. a cable shoots up thud... the disc sticks to the boat's hull. shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. dangling from the cruiser, shane fixes a bomb to the hull. he releases himself from the boat and speeds away boom. a dense explosion sends ripples through the water and electricity crackling around the boat.}
<L>__{interior fishing boat control deck continuous}
<A>__{a surge of electrical force blasts from the control panel. sparks fly. the two serbian men jolt backwards wham and hit the wall. all the needles inside all the dials go limp. the roar of the engines dies and the boat stops.}

<D>__{what's happening?}
<L>__{exterior pacific ocean continuous}
<A>__{the jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a synchronized swimming move, and the jet ski drivers are simultaneously yanked below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our seals (also in black wet suits and goggles) the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice.}

<A>__{the shaken serbs climb to their feet.}
<C>__{serbian 2}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{they look around, and see the seals, on the jet skis: in the masks they are indistinguishable from the gun totting men they switched paces with. all seems clear. serb 1 pushes on the throttle... nothing.}

<A>__{professor plummer panics, as the water rises up to his mouth he struggles, but can't get free. up to his nose, over his head.... he's gone. then shane wolf rises out of the water, hauling the professor up. he cuts the professor's gag. plummer screams. shane removes his mouth piece. shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{lieutenant shane wolfe, united states navy. i'm gonna get you outta here. but you have to do exactly what i say, when i say it. my way no highway option. do you copy?}
<P>__{(plummer nods, terrified.)}
<D>__{where's the briefcase?}

<L>__{exterior ocean's surface moments later}
<A>__{shane and the professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them. shane pulls out a retractable crossbow. it clicks open and he shoots a cable into the belly of the helicopter above him.}

<D>__{hold on.}
<L>__{interior helicopter a second later}
<A>__{shane appears at the pilot's door, holding the professor. shane addresses the pilot in perfect serbian.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you know how to swim?}
<A>__{the pilot nods, terrified. shane tosses the pilot out. shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls, pulling the professor in behind him. on the surface of the water continuous the seals on the jet skis salute shane in the chopper, then disappear gracefully back into the water.}
<L>__{interior helicopter continuous}
<A>__{shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. he looks beside him, the professor looks terrified. the professor takes out his mouth piece.}

<D>__{no. i'm just not big on chit chat.}
<L>__{exterior mountain clearing a little later}
<A>__{a pave hawk sh 60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly, waits. shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream. shane and charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting hawk. charles stops shane.}

<D>__{lieutenant, thank you. (he pats his briefcase) you saved more than just my life today. can i call my wife to let her know i'm okay?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{negative. not imperative to the mission. we have to keep moving. i have strict orders to get you out of here safely.}

<D>__{i'm safe, lieutenant. please. she thinks i'm dead. (then) don't you have a family?}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(this gets him:)}

<D>__{joe, todd, lulu, peter, tyler.}
<A>__{the briefcase pops open. shane looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{my kids. it's voice activated. designed it myself. i do security, that's my specialty. (gestures back:) those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days couldn't crack it. and you should see what happens to you if open it without the code. i have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it?}

<D>__{negative.}
<A>__{charles takes a cell phone out of the case. shane looks in the case: it's empty, except for the phone and a family photo. charles dials his cell phone... nothing}

<A>__{wham. shane drops, knocked unconscious. all goes black.}
<L>__{exterior pave hawk moments later}
<A>__{the helicopter is on fire. wolf lies facedown in the stream. he looks around, barely conscious. shane's p.o.v.: everything is a blur, in slow motion. he sees charles, unconscious. a huey helicopter lands. a very tall man steps out, and takes charles' briefcase. there is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites. everything is ablaze. shane reaches out, grabs the picture of charles' kids then goes unconscious.}

<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. his arm and face bandaged. shane's captain enters: bill fawcett (35) friendly, unassuming. he looks like he hasn't slept in days. shane salutes him with his bandaged arm it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{captain, sir.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{as you were lieutenant.}
<A>__{bill sits down beside the bed. he takes a long look at shane. he holds a report in his hand.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{we've been through a lot together shane. you're the best man i ever trained. and a good friend.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{... i know sir. and i except full responsibility for the mission's failure.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{he had to call his family. a lapse in judgement on my part that i regret sir.}
<A>__{bill shakes his head, disappointed. he pulls up a chair, and sits opposite shane.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{... plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had a genius. he was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. he called it g.h.o.s.t.: guided high altitude scrambling transmitter. one pulse from the ghost satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. that's what the serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get s inside the briefcase.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{the case was empty sir, as i stated in my report.}
<A>__{bill considers this. then...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{not a surprise, really. not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. g.h.o.s.t. is still out there, (bill smiles:) which is why i'm going to give you another shot.}
<A>__{shane sits up. he can't believe his good fortune.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{sir. thank you. i... appreciate your confidence.}
<A>__{invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an iv, and starts to rise.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{i will need to put a team together. i'm gonna need the mini sub, i need access to an ep3 aries 2 spy plane...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(interrupting:)}
<D>__{negative. it's not that kind of mission.}
<A>__{shane listens, intrigued.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{two days ago, i got a call from the professor's wife... widow. she told me someone had broken into her home. searched the place, top to bottom.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's scared. the family's scared. whoever killed the professor must think g.h.o.s.t. is in that house. maybe it is, maybe it isn't. either way, i need someone to stay at that house, and protect them. and while you're there find out if the program is in there.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{that's it? why would you want me for that, sir.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the professor's wife requested you.}
<A>__{shane is surprised... bill pulls a tiny tape recorder from his pocket, presses play, we hear professor plummer's voice.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{honey, i'm alive. listen: a lot can happen between here and home if anything happens to me, call lt. shane wolfe. he's a good man... anyway, i should go. i will call you in an hour. i love you.}
<A>__{shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{... you gotta problem with this mission?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{sirnosir. it's just that... i've never been very good with kids, sir. not even when i was a kid sir.}

<A>__{shane packs his duffel bag. he opens a drawer: there's five t shirts, identical to the one he wears. he opens another drawer: five khaki pants, also identical to the one he wears. he opens the closet: there's a massive fur collared coat. hm. he rejects it. shane packs his duffel with military gear: gps compass, night vision goggles, camouflage vest, machete... they all go in. shane heads to the door, then goes back to his chest of drawers. he reaches in, and pulls out a small, old medal: the ribbon is faded and frayed. he looks at it for a moment, then unzips his suit and pins it to the inside, like it's a lucky rabbit's foot.}
<L>__{exterior suburban street afternoon}
<A>__{a taxi door opens. shane looks like a bad ass, ready for anything. he steps from the taxi onto an adorable troll doll on the sidewalk. it squeaks. shane's p.o.v.: julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys all over the lawn, and a "bless this mess" welcome mat. shane double checks the address. the sprinklers go off. shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of those long cheerful doorbells). we hear tiny feet approach then the door swings open, shane looks down and sees lulu, 8, peering up at him. shane eyes lulu. lulu eyes shane, then:}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{mom! there's some weird bald guy at the door!}

<C>__{julie }
<D>__{get your butts down here and say "hello!"}
<A>__{and then three pairs of feet come down the stairs. lulu, zoe, 15, and todd, 14 line up like the perfect family portrait. todd's hair hangs in his face. he wears a sid vicious shirt and a long trench coat.}

<D>__{you have a pleasant family, ma'am.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{charles wasn't around too much. his work took him all over the world. he'd be gone six or seven months at a time. so i think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. zoe and todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. maybe in todd's case semi normal.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{mrs. plummer, i have to tell you that i did everything i could...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{charles was in a dangerous business. i knew it when i married him. no one's to blame here.}

<A>__{wider reveals the cast of `the sound of music'.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{shane's military march version of the musical. nuns sing "how do you solve a problem like maria?" the von trapp kids perform "so long, farewell." in the audience, julie watches in astonishment. she is surrounded by her children. scott: in a suit, his hair combed, claire: dressed to the nines, the little brownie troop, even murney. lulu has a basket in her lap inside: gary the duck and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw. they all watch, rapt. you are sixteen begins. shane watches with bated breath. todd spins. in slow motion, he leaps into the spin kick. it's fantastic a michael jordan dunk. the audience goes nuts, shane stands, and shouts:}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{yesss! (and an armed forces:) huu ah!}
<A>__{the audience stares at him, until he sits back down, beaming with pride. finally: "climb every mountain." hearts swell, as the family crosses the papier mache alps. a standing ovation. the performers take their curtain calls, then giddily gesture shane to come out. he humbly steps into view and the house goes crazy. thundering applause. a cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on him. shane smiles, touched. mission accomplished.}
