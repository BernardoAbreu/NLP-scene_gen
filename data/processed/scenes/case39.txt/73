<L>__{interior emily's house day}
<A>__{emily, days later, dressed for work, halves an omelet with a spatula and slides the halves onto two plates.}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(calls to other room)}
<D>__{breakfast.}
<A>__{there's no answer. emily goes to get her.}
<L>__{interior lucy's room day}
<A>__{stops in the doorway.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{honey, breakfa }
<A>__{sees lucy hide something under her pillow. emily comes over, brow arched, playful.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{come on, let me see...}
<A>__{lucy guiltily eyes the floor. emily lifts the pillow. underneath it is a photograph. emily, as a young girl, with her mother. she looks at lucy, then at the filing cabinet from which it was taken. more surprised than upset.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you went through my things?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i wanted to know what happened to you.}
<A>__{disarming sincerity. emily's gaze falls to the photo. quiet moment. she sits down on the bed with it.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{is that your mom?}
<A>__{emily nods, lost in the image. it's a photo that captures her entire childhood. emily and her mother sitting on the steps of a house, together but apart, like a lost child that sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasn't yet noticed her. emily's ten year old face shows the quiet sadness of the disconnect. reminds you of a child from her caseload.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{she used to just leave, she'd just...}
<P>__{(gestures `adios')}
<D>__{...and i never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... i used to think it was my fault and i would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything i could think of, so she'd think i was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was.}
<A>__{emily fights her emotions and, practiced at the task, wins. lucy sits beside her on the bed. understands her deeply. linked by their pasts.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{where was your dad?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{gone, he left before i was born. first time i met him i was like thirteen.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what'd you say to him?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{oh, i had all these things i was gonna say. angry things i'd thought of and kind of memorized. and um.... and then i met him and i wasn't angry, i was just sad and i told him...}
<P>__{(pauses, raw emotion)}
<D>__{i said, i love you, even if you don't love me.}
<A>__{emily smiles a pained smile and then buries the memory. lucy, a portrait of contrition:}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{are you mad at me?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no... no, i'm not mad at you.}
<P>__{(puts her arm around her)}
<D>__{but i need you not to do that again, okay? go through my private things without asking?}
<A>__{lucy nods okay. emily moves on, with a loving touch:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{omelet's getting cold. better hurry.}
<A>__{lucy exits. emily eyes the photo a moment longer then stands and puts it away in the filing cabinet. she pauses, feeling exposed, and turns the little key to lock the drawers.}
