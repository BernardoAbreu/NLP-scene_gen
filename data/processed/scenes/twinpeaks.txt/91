<L>__{79. interior palmer dining room night}
<A>__{laura is already at the table. sarah puts the rest of the dinner on the table and sits down just as leland palmer enters from the kitchen. he is pretending he is a giant. using a voice like a giant.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(big giant voice)}
<D>__{hello, laura. hello sarah. where's my axe?}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"i'm hungry".}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh, leland.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{dad.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(suddenly speaking norwegian)}
<D>__{hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.}
<A>__{translation is: how are you? my name is leland palmer. laura and sarah stare at him.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian. so you can talk to them. i want you to learn to say, "hello, my name is leland palmer".}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{but my name isn't leland palmer.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{neither is mine. and can't we talk about something serious for a change.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{this is serious. mr. benjamin horne's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. sarah, you first.}
<A>__{leland repeats his phrase for sarah's benefit.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.}
<A>__{sarah stumbles through it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter sarah palmer.}
<A>__{leland repeats his phrase back to her. extends his hand in a friendly handshake.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{good. we'll practice some more. laura, now you try it.}
<A>__{laughingly, laura does the same thing.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter laura palmer.}
<A>__{after laura is done.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{all together now...}
<A>__{leland extends a hand to each of them. an air of insanity seems to come over the palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh hysterically and talk in broken norwegian.}
