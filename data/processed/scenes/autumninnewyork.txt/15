<L>__{interior wills' bedroom night}
<A>__{an antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser. wills stands before a mahogany mirror, buttoning a freshly laundered white shirt. lying on the cradle bed, half wrapped in a sheet, naked but for a string of pearls, is tanya, 35, raven haired, much too thin. she smokes a cigarette.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{oh, wills, please, not again. it's our third date and we're already in a rut.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{but i thought you loved it.}
<A>__{she stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it to the ashtray, her ash falls on a new york magazine. on the cover is a photograph of wills standing next to a young chef in a fashionable restaurant. the caption reads: "the prodigal son returns."}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{oh, i do except for the fact that there isn't a single thing on the menu i can eat.}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{sure, there is; there's just very little you're willing to digest.}
<A>__{he slips in a cuff link. she affects a breezy indifference }
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{fine then. we'll go, i will get big, fat, and horrible, and it'll serve you right.}
<A>__{wills slips on a silk tie }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{no, it won't. because it takes at least a few weeks to get fat and by then you won't even be speaking to me.}
<C>__{tanya}
<P>__{(curiously)}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<A>__{he stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{because we have no future. all i can offer you is this... what we have right now... nothing more meaningful... until it ends.}
<A>__{he goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i could have waited to tell you, but i wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.}
<A>__{she stares at him, speechless.}
