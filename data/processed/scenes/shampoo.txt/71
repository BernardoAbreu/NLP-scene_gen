<A>__{george shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the living room.}
<L>__{interior george's living room}
<A>__{george finds himself facing lester and two other men who look like hoods. lester sits in the chair george sat in the other night. before him is a bottle of j & b, a paper bucket filled with melting ice. the other men rise when george walks into the room. lester, glass in hand, stares silently at george.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(to the other two)}
<D>__{wait outside, would you?}
<A>__{the two men walk toward george and pass him on either side, coming very close. both of them are much bigger than george. they stare through george as they pass him. george continues to stand there. lester, drinking, continues to stare. lester glances idly around the living room. then back to george.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{you live like a pig.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(lester doesn't answer)}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{everything all right?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i will call you, it's okay.}
<A>__{george site down. lester has risen to his feet, a little unsteadily.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{now, george, i want to hear it from you. either you admit it, man to man, to my face or i will have him pound it out of you, and he does a hell of a job, believe me.}
<A>__{george nods.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i believe you...}
<A>__{lester waits, standing over george.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i wanna hear about it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh jesus christ.}
<A>__{lester slaps him.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i wanna hear about it, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... i'm too tired to lie, i'm too tired to tell the truth... i'm too tired for anything.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i wanna hear about it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what can i say!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i wanna know your thinking, i wanna know how someone like you thinks. did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? maybe that's your idea of being anti establishment!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm not anti establishment.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{that's got nothing to do with it... you're so beyond my comprehension i can't even discuss it with you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{no, not yet, not yet. you worry about it for a while, i've been worrying all night, now you can worry.}
<A>__{a pause. lester freshens his drink.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{was it me, did you have something against me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what, do you think i planned it?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{did they have something against me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{didn't they tell you?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i wanna hear it from you!}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(agonized)}
<D>__{... how am i gonna tell you what they have against you? i mean jesus fucking christ, they're women, aren't they? have you ever listened to women talk, man? have you? well i do, i do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. i'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? being fucked up by some guy. that's all that's on their minds. i'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? all women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. they fucking hate us! don't you know that?}
<A>__{lester has listened to this with some alteration of his intensity.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{... yes, i follow your thinking on that.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. it just happened. felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to pta meetings?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{do you think lorna hates her? i don't think she hates her. i mean she may resent her a little...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, are you kidding, man? she hates her.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{why, why do you think that is?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, fuck, lester, how should i know?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, i don't know.}
<A>__{a pause. lester goes to pour himself another drink.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(to george)}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{lester}

<D>__{okay, thanks.}
<A>__{lester gets up and goes to the kitchen.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you don't have a clean glass in the house.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(talking to himself)}
<D>__{i will have to wash one out.}
<A>__{he turns on the faucet in the kitchen. he brings the glass.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{jesus, what a way to live. i never lived like this, not even when i was your age, not even when i never had a dime.}
<A>__{george takes the drink. lester just shakes his head.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all i can say.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{me!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, you were never going to give me the money.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i was gonna give you the money. probably i was. shit, i don't know, i don't know anything anymore.}
<A>__{lester sits and stares into his drink.}

<D>__{i tell you, you never know... you just never know... one minute you're here and the nexterior.. i mean a man at my age, how long have i got ten years? five years? i wish i knew... what i was living for.}
<A>__{george looks at him.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{... you can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... i don't know, what's the point of having it all. look at me. i don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam lyndon johnson!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh yeah...}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe nixon will do something. what's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. i wouldn't let 'em run my business, i can tell you that much. not if i had any choice in the matter.}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i don't know what to do with you. i don't know, i don't know what's right or wrong anymore.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't either, lester, i swear to you i don't.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{what about jackie?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i mean, how did that happen?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{lester, it just happened.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{she's nothing but a whore.}

<D>__{no }
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{just a whore, i go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. i'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, man, no. you can say everybody's a whore. she's okay. i mean jackie'll fuck around but not that much. somewhere she really likes you, lester, and it's not just the bread. she's okay.}
<A>__{lester sits and thinks about that.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you really think so?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm finished with her.}
<A>__{lester goes to the door. he turns as if he'd just thought of something.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{oh, by the way, i think you oughta know lorna thinks she's got the clap.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{yeah, the clap. that's what she thinks. but who knows i don't know.}
<A>__{george nods. lester shakes his head.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{i don't know anything anymore.}
<A>__{he opens the door and goes out. the two hoods are standing there. they look to lester.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(to hoods)}
