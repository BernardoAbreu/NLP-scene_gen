<A>__{a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of granite and steel. off screen a restaurant grade sub zero opens with a hiss. fan starts. beyond the kitchen we see through a dining room to a den. a chair is overturned. we hear muffled sounds. we see feet extend through a door jamb. someone's on the floor. a television is playing, distantly.}
