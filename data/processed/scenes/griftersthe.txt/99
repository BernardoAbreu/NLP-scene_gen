<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{expensive room. cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed, sits cross legged on the bed. myra enters, happy, carrying dress shop boxes. she stops, shocked, when she sees cole.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{no, baby. not again.}
<A>__{he stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it's hollow. you'll fall through.}

<C>__{myra}
<D>__{it's just the strain again, the stress. we'll take a vacation.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it's all hollow. nothing behind it.}
<A>__{she approaches him, scared but needing him.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{cole, you scare me when this happens. one of these times...}
<A>__{she touches him. he suddenly lashes out, knocking her backward, glaring at her.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{demon! demon! that's why you can walk on it! demon!}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(heartbroken)}
<D>__{oh, cole, please. please come out of it. what would i do without you?}
<A>__{distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around, hugs himself, sits staring at demons. she watches him, mournful, knowing he's gone.}
