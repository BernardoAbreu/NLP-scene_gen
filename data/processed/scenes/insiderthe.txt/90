<D>__{the straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." when i came on board at b&w, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. i wanted it out immediately. i was told that it would affect sales, so i should mind my own business. i constructed a memo to mr. sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung specific carcinogen...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{and you sent the document forward to sandefur?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i sent the document forward to sandefur. i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{in other words, you were charging sandefur and brown & williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously ...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{most certainly.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{and on march 24, thomas sandefur, ceo of brown & williamson had you fired. and the reason he gave you?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{poor communication skills.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{and, do you wish you hadn't come forward? you wish you hadn't blown the whistle?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{yeah, there are times i wish i hadn't done it. there are times i feel compelled to do it. if you asked me would i do it again? do i think it's worth it? yeah, i think it's worth it.}
