<L>__{interior satan's disciples' clubhouse day}
<A>__{the hallway leading into the clubhouse is dark and gloomy. rock music assails them as they make their passage into the main room. clubhouse main room they reach the main room where about ten or so disciples are lounging about. one has his nose in a book, the road less traveled. another reads the wall street journal. two others are seated at a card table, playing a game of poker. still another is sprawled on a couch, smoking a cigarette. the walls are festooned with biker posters. the place is a bit of a mess, but innocuous. the head disciple stands in the center of the room and addresses his clan.}
<C>__{head disciple}
<D>__{hey, guys. this here is, uh ...}
<A>__{he turns to marian, realizing he doesn't know her name.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(meekly)}
<D>__{marian.}
<C>__{head disciple}
<P>__{(booming voice)}
<D>__{marian!}
<C>__{a chorus of voices}
<D>__{hi, marian. hey, marian. yo, marian.}

<D>__{disciple #2 hey, is she cute? disciple #3 does she like motorcycles? disciple #4 can she cook?}
<A>__{amiable laughter fills the room. marian laughs with them. she glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in new york.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you know, this isn't so bad. it looks like our kids' rooms when they were growing up.}
<A>__{insert shots of overflowing ashtrays, crushed beer cans, fast food wrappers balled up and strewn on tables. back to marian, her brow knitted thoughtfully in a schoolmarmish expression.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{could use some cleaning.}
<A>__{insert shots of several of the disciples' faces, turning to her in slow motion with mock baleful looks of disapprobation. there's a beat, then ...}
