<P>__{(in answer to the crowd's applause)}
<D>__{thank you, thank you very much!}
<A>__{enzo and novelli stand on a little stage facing the crowd. enzo is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the audience.}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{... now i'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue. dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet.}
<A>__{while the attentive crowd listens to novelli, enzo is gesturing to roberto, explaining what appetizers he wants from the cocktail trays. the crowd laughs.}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{but, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue!}
<A>__{there's wild applause. enzo lifts the trophy over his head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{good luck to you all!}
