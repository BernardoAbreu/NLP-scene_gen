<L>__{interior woodward library day}
<A>__{irene escorts miranda into the library. a warden follows.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{how are we feeling today?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{'we'?}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{sorry i asked.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{doesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{fitting right in, aren't you?}
<A>__{the library is pretty much empty at this hour except for the librarian and the odd janitor tidying up. an efficient looking man rises from a desk, briefcase in place, glass of water this is attorney theodore "teddy" howard.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{miranda.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{irene checks her watch. the warden hangs back, keeping watch.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{she's due back in the rec room in twenty, counselor.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{thank you kindly.}
<A>__{miranda sits. waits until irene is out of hearing range.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{teddy, i know you knew doug well and this is an extremely }
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{i'm here as your lawyer. so whatever my relationship was with doug is no longer of consequence. first things first, how are they treating you?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{like i'm crazy.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{you know this place better than anyone. anything out of the ordinary?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{other than me being crazy? no.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{the da is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week. they're eager to resolve this situation because well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here. doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model. our best shot scratch that, our only shot is to claim temporary insanity.}
<A>__{as he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait teddy, you know me. i wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. not even in self defense. isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked doug and i went into shock?}
<A>__{teddy shakes his head.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind?}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{frankly, no. neighbors heard screams. they have you at the scene, they have the murder weapon and they have your prints everywhere. the only thing they don't have is motive.}
<A>__{she keeps absently playing with the bandage. the adhesive is giving. the bandage starting to peel off.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{because there is no motive.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{and that's what's confusing them. the fact that you're a brilliant psychiatrist doesn't help either. it fills their heads with ideas. they figure if you were to plan a murder you might know how to fake insanity to get out of it.}
<A>__{she pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. not looking. but we see the beginning of a pattern in her scarred skin }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm not faking anything.}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{good. i pass no judgment either way. the point is }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{the point is i'm the only person who doesn't believe i killed my husband. i never thought i'd say this, but i feel like i'm in the middle of a conspiracy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you believe i'm crazy?}
<A>__{an uncomfortable teddy takes too long before answering. miranda looks down, humiliated and now she sees it. perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads: "not alone." petrified, miranda jumps back, knocks down teddy's glass of water all over his papers, her chair topples over. the warden and janitor look up teddy tries for delicate:}
<C>__{teddy howard}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what i believe.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{forget it. forget i asked.}
<A>__{push into her face as involuntary tears roll down and we }
