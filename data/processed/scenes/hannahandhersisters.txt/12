<L>__{interior frederick's loft night}
<A>__{lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers. she walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(to an offscreen frederick)}
<D>__{want some coffee or tea?}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, two columns. lamps hang down from the ceiling. the classical music still plays in the background. lee stops at a plastic enclosed work area. frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(stirring her coffee)}
<D>__{how about something to eat?}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{no, nothing.}
<A>__{the background music stops.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(walking around the screen to frederick)}
<D>__{mmm, what am i gonna do with you?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<A>__{as lee walks over to the drawing board where frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. the table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{god!}
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<D>__{and why didn't you come tonight? we all had a terrific time. i really think you would have enjoyed yourself.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(not looking at lee)}
<D>__{i'm going through a period of my life where i just can't be around people.}
<P>__{(putting down the}
<D>__{brushes and wiping his hands with the}
<P>__{same rag)}
<D>__{i didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you're not going to abuse them. they're all so sweet.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(taking off his glasses)}
<D>__{lee...}
<P>__{(pausing, reaching for lee's hand)}
<D>__{you are the only person i can be with...who i really look forward to being with.}
<P>__{(pulling lee to him, around the board)}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(compliantly)}
<D>__{you're too harsh with everyone. you know that, don't you?}
<A>__{frederick and lee embrace; lee sighs.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(looking into lee's eyes)}
<D>__{isn't it enough that i can love you?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{mmm...}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{...you're such a puzzle.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{so sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<D>__{well, there was a time}
<P>__{(sniffing again)}
<D>__{when you were very happy to be only with me. you wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{mm hm.}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{have i really taught you everything i have to give?}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{lee kisses frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(turning her head in frederick's direction)}
<D>__{oh, elliot said he might have a couple of clients for you.}
<A>__{lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as frederick talks.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i'm sure all those morons he handles have a deep feeling for art.}
<A>__{lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf. she leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(flipping through the book)}
<D>__{mmm}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{you never know. they might. he's just trying to do the nice thing.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{because he likes you.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(looking up from the book)}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{frederick, leaving his work area, walks past lee; his hands are in his pockets.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(looking at lee as he goes by)}
<D>__{elliot lusts after you.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{based on what? you never even see him.}
<A>__{the camera stays with frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area.}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{based on...whenever you see him, you always come home full of books he's recommended...}
<A>__{he sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off his shoes.}
<C>__{frederick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...or films you must see or...}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(walking over to him)}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no. he's my sister's husband. and i think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. he's very intelligent.}
<A>__{lee sits down next to frederick; he takes her hand.}
<C>__{frederick}
<D>__{he's a glorified accountant, and he's after you.}
<P>__{(kissing lee's hand)}
<D>__{and i prefer to sell my work to people who appreciate it, not to rock stars.}
<P>__{(kissing lee's face)}
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{lee kisses frederick back on the cheek. they embrace. frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{ohhh!}
