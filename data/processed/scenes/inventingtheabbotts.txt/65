<A>__{a drab, four door chevrolet sedan with wisconsin license plates speeds away from town. incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an african american driver. there are two passengers in the back seat: a conservatively dressed, middle aged woman and eleanor abbott. there is nothing telling about eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face.}
