<L>__{interior college coffee house day}
<A>__{enid and rebecca sit in a semi crowded college hang out.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{...you don't have to make a million dollars just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{i wonder if i hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? maybe that's why we spend so much time together.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you're gross.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{see that guy?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he gives me a total boner!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{he's like the biggest idiot of all time!}
<A>__{the guy, a college sophomore, walks by them with two friends.}
<C>__{college sophomore}
<D>__{are you guys up for some reggae tonight?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{okay, you're right.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{heads up.}
<A>__{an earnest "alternative rock" guy approaches rebecca. he hands her a flyer.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey, my band is playing here on friday night and uh... there's gonna be a bunch of cool bands playing and stuff and you don't have to pay if you show this flyer at the door... you should come check it out.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(shyly)}
<D>__{thanks...}
<P>__{(she looks away)}
<A>__{enid takes the flyer from rebecca. there are a bunch of bands listed.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{which one is your band?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{alien autopsy.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{bitchin'.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(embarrassing pause; then, to rebecca)}
<D>__{yeah, well... maybe i will see you there...}
<P>__{(pause; walks away)}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what a dork!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you're just jealous.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, right... believe me, at this point i'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that's not true, i just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo bohemian losers!}
<P>__{(sad pause)}
<D>__{sometimes i think i act so weird because i'm crazy from sexual frustration.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{...maybe we should be lesbos...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{get away from me!}
