<L>__{exterior mars one base camp. night}
<A>__{the mars one base camp looms in the foreground, like some desolate, otherwordly ghost town. and then, in the night sky beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright streak of red as the remo slashes down into the martian atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind distant mountains. then all is stillness again, deathly stillness and silence...}
<L>__{interior international space station. viewport. day}
<A>__{beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. he's just lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this disaster, the probable end of the mars program, and the certain end of his own career. he doesn't, at first, even hear the nearby voice.}
<C>__{new capcom}
<D>__{ray...? we've got some new data, just coming in.}
<A>__{beck looks up, his eyes red rimmed. the capcom shifts uneasily. he's holding a computer printout.}
<C>__{new capcom}
<D>__{we just it doesn't make any sense. we're not sure how to read this.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{data?}
<C>__{new capcom}
<D>__{yes sir. telemetry reports the remo has left its orbit and reached the martian surface.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{crashed?}
<C>__{new capcom}
<D>__{no sir. under power.}
<A>__{beck snatches the paper, staring at it. for the first time we see some life coming back into him.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{new capcom}
<D>__{sixty three minutes after mars recovery went off line. sir, the graph reads like a controlled descent. but that doesn't make any }
<A>__{beck suddenly understands. and it's a joy to see his face, the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{they used the remo as a lander.}
<A>__{the capcom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of hope.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{it's mcconnell, it's got to be! nobody else could have pulled this off. son of a bitch! they're alive.}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
