<L>__{int: jones apartment night}
<A>__{jones opens the door to his apartment and enters. silus follows. the place is a dump. lounge and kitchen all one area, bedroom off to one side, dishes in the sink, clothes everywhere. jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a coffee machine, then grabs a dirty glass, pours a drink. silus watches him. jones comes into the lounge. he still has his gun in his hand. he stares at silus, whose perfect outline makes jones' life seem even more abysmal.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{i want to help you. they know you talked to the press.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{they can fuck off. for that matter, so can you.}
<A>__{jones takes a slurp on his drink.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you'd be the last person i'd trust.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i saw you. remember. watching lilly, when she was asleep.}
<A>__{silus doesn't answer now. jones moves forward.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{maybe you're just like your brother. maybe you're helping him. now there's a thought.}
<A>__{jones prods silus' shoulder with the gun.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you know where she is?}
<A>__{jones prods again and finds silus' elegant steel fingers around his wrist. the two men face off.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you've changed. not the outside. but inside. i know you. you know what, i can see myself?}
<A>__{jones tries to wrench his wrist free, but silus holds it tight. jones swings his free arm and smashes silus on the side of the face. for a moment silus doesn't move, then his hand is around jones' throat. squeezing. squeezing. his other hand wrenching the gun from jones' hand. there is silence in the room, apart from jones' choking gags. then silus pushes jones back so that he flies into a chair. jones stares up at silus now, fear in his eyes. silus watches him. then a sound attracts his attention. cut to water hisses from jones' coffee machine in the kitchen.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing; sneering)}
<D>__{coffee's ready.}
<A>__{cut to silus, turning, listening, focusing on the water dripping from the coffee machine. silus is concentrating. realization comes into his eyes. we zoom close to silus' ear. the soundtrack becomes enhanced. cut to the tap in jones' festering sink, dripping; plop plop plop. we see the water in the bottom of the sink reflecting the room. we see silus approaching; reflected there. his hand enters frame and touches the water. and we hear edgar's voice, the words we heard him say in augustus' office.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{you know where i am. everything flows from me...}
<A>__{we see silus staring at the water. we see a giant drop of water hanging from the tap, hanging, hanging, then falling... cut to}
