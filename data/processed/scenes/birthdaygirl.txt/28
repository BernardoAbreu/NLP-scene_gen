<C>__{john}
<D>__{the uh... the other bedroom...}
<A>__{she looks at it, then up at john. she turns and walks out. now she's back, with her camouflaged hold all, dumps it onto the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no hands, starts unpacking. john plugs in the lamp by the bed. to show nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, and then feels stupid.}

<D>__{i will get an ashtray.}
<A>__{with john gone, nadia stops unpacking. she walks to the window and stares out over the rooftops of the estate.}
