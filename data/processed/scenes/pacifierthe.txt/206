<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{shane's military march version of the musical. nuns sing "how do you solve a problem like maria?" the von trapp kids perform "so long, farewell." in the audience, julie watches in astonishment. she is surrounded by her children. scott: in a suit, his hair combed, claire: dressed to the nines, the little brownie troop, even murney. lulu has a basket in her lap inside: gary the duck and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw. they all watch, rapt. you are sixteen begins. shane watches with bated breath. todd spins. in slow motion, he leaps into the spin kick. it's fantastic a michael jordan dunk. the audience goes nuts, shane stands, and shouts:}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{yesss! (and an armed forces:) huu ah!}
<A>__{the audience stares at him, until he sits back down, beaming with pride. finally: "climb every mountain." hearts swell, as the family crosses the papier mache alps. a standing ovation. the performers take their curtain calls, then giddily gesture shane to come out. he humbly steps into view and the house goes crazy. thundering applause. a cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on him. shane smiles, touched. mission accomplished.}
