<A>__{still in chains, dances with wolves and wind in his hair are dragging elgin's body onto shore. dances with wolves rifles through the dead man's pockets. he finds a set of keys and plops down to unlock his shackles. the wounded indian warrior is being tended to. smiles a lot is downstream washing bauer's blood off.}

<A>__{a warrior is stripping down spivey. he holds up the dead man's tunic, but doesn't notice that something plops out. it's the journal. it floats off into the current, well out of dances with wolves field of vision. it is lost forever.}
