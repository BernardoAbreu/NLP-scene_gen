<A>__{fifteen minutes forward. the scene shifts to the livingroom. mitchell and nicole are alone in the room. sam comes back from another room, as mary appears from the kitchen with a plate of cookies.}
<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{that got you talking about depositions and lawyers. by the time daddy came back from the washroom and mom came in with her tea and cookies, you were going on about how tough it would be for me to answer some of the questions those other lawyers would ask .}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{they work for the people we're trying to sue. their job is to try to minimize damages. our job, nicole, is to try to maximize them. you have to think of it that way. as people doing their jobs. no good guys or bad guys. just our side and their side.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i won't lie.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i don't want you to lie.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{the truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{there's no such thing as an accident, nicole. not in a situation like this.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you seem very sure about that.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i'm absolutely positive.}
<A>__{nicole turns to face sam. she stares at him.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no matter what i'm asked, i will tell the truth.}
<A>__{sam looks back, expressionless.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{that's fine. i want you to be absolutely truthful. and i will be right there to advise and help you. and there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and that's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set. it'll be the same for everybody. they'll be deposing the ottos and the walkers, the bus driver...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{dolores.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{yes. dolores...and even your mom and dad. but i will make sure you go last.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. it's not going to be easy, nicole. do you understand that?}
<A>__{nicole nods.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{when do they award damages?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{depends. this could drag on for quite a while. but we'll be there at the end, sam. don't you worry.}
<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{at that moment, i hated my parents daddy for what he knew and had done,}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{and even mom for what she didn't know and hadn't done. you told me it wasn't going to be easy. but as i sat there, staring at daddy, i knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my life.}
