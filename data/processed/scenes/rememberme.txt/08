<A>__{tyler and his roommate, aidan brewer, 22, energetic, inappropriate, walking west towards n.y.u. young people in easy, summery dress. tyler smokes. aidan doesn't. aidan remembers something, smirks.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{i sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you sold my who? ...what?}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{that voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning... i sold her a toothbrush. got three bucks.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{...congratulations?}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{are in order, yes. because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "the s.l.u.t."}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i was unaware we had a previous business venture.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{the 'single lady's universal tote'. it's the one night stand travel pack for women. we throw in some make up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers. retail it at s19.95, maybe do an infomercial.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{and you think women would buy this? with money?}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{hey one night stands happen... it's a part of life... like stubbing your toe. sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon...}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(nodding sagely)}
<D>__{of course. yes.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{don't underestimate the novelty gift market. think about it... instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with "the slut." everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains. what do you say? are you down?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i'm down with getting you on some sort of medication.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{ok...fine...be cynical...just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb. one of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at mickey d's or something.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{or denny's. denny's was big in the 19th century.}
