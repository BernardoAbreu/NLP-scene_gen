<L>__{exterior main street night}
<A>__{as edward and jenny approach main street, they find "downtown" has been transformed. lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers. the whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, edward bloom. before he can protest, two women have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. the resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. from farmer to baker's wife, everyone wants to dance with edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool. still, he's having a blast. jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly. beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her. then mildred cuts in to dance with edward. it's hard to hear over the music.}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{jenny thinks you're quite a catch. we all do.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(not hearing)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{i said you're quite a catch!}
<A>__{edward stops dancing. a beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd. beamen is there, with jenny on his shoulders.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have to leave. tonight.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{this town is everything a man could ask for. and if i were to end up here, i'd consider myself lucky. but the fact is, i'm not ready to end up anywhere.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{no one's ever left.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how are you gonna make it without your shoes?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i suspect it will hurt a lot.}
<A>__{and with that, edward walks down main street. the townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads. poor edward bloom's gone crazy.}
<C>__{beamen}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{you won't find a better place!}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i don't expect to.}
<A>__{jenny runs to him. she'd tackle him if she could.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{promise me you'll come back.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i promise. someday. when i'm really supposed to.}
<A>__{it's not good enough, but it will have to do. edward keeps walking.}
