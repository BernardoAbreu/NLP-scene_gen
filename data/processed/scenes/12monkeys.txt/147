<C>__{dr. mason}
<D>__{jeffrey??? ... very well. you're out of your mind, jeffrey. i know all about your insane plan. that woman your psychiatrist she told me.}
<A>__{jeffrey raises his eyebrows. this he hadn't expected.}
<C>__{dr. mason}
<D>__{i didn't believe her it seemed too crazy even for you. but, just in case, i took steps to make sure you couldn't do it. i took myself out of the loop! i don't have the code any more. i don't have access to the virus. so, go ahead torture me, but you can't extract anything of use to yourself.}

<C>__{dr. mason}
<D>__{please tell me, jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? i don't have to tell you i'm afraid.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
