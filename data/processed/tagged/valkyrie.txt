(note: hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.) tresckow and his aide step forward to greet hitler, but they are pushed back by ss guards. the fuhrer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo. to tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere. it is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive. hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.}

<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{you said yourself, i'm a field officer. you all may understand government, but i know the men. a great many of them may hate hitler, but they all fear him they fear himmler, goebbels, the whole of the reich. that kind of fear won't just die with hitler. and as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. authority. and if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all.}

"all right." then she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears. it is an important moment. read it again, taking the time to picture it in your mind. then leave it alone. done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his family and the fate of the world.}
