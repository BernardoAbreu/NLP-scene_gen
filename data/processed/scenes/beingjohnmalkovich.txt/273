<D>__{oh, my friends. be thankful you're not human. people are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. i've lost my heart to two of them and i almost lost my soul to another. and i'm no better. look at the way i keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. well, i've been in a cage too, my friends. literally and figuratively. so tonight i set you free.}
<A>__{lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks all the cages. the animals scurry and fly out of their cages, and out of the house. lotte watches silently until she is alone.}

<D>__{good bye, friends.}
