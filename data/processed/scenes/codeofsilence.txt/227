<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{the "prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret bristling with firepower. it is driving luis and the other stupefied comachos further back into the building. eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller. the comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank with automatic fire. but they are no match. two continuous streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the structure, churning the comachos to hamburger.}
<B>__{comacho shot rings out}
<A>__{eddie goes down and the prowler hand controller falls to the ground, shattered. the prowler goes berserk, spraying death in a 360 degree circle until all the ammo is gone. then silence. eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. it's not serious. it appears everyone is out of ammunition. but a few comachos are still hidden in the factory. eddie is after them like a tiger. victor, shoulder still bandaged, never has a chance. he goes down, battered and broken. but luis has crept up behind eddie. he jumps over a steel plate. he's going for diana, a long knife in his hand. eddie reaches for a reload. puts it in his magnum. aims, and blows luis away just as he reaches for diana.}
