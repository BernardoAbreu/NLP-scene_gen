<L>__{exterior french countryside dawn}
<A>__{first light. the sound of distant guns has been replaced by the chirping of birds. the americans are taking five. miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at the view. it's lovely. dew shimmers on the long grass. the war is far away. upham walks next to him. they look out at the view together without speaking for a moment.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it looks like a renoir.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{yes. do you know sibelius' fourth symphony, the normandy?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i've been humming it.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it seemed appropriate.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{you know classical music?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{some.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{where are you from, captain?}
<A>__{miller smiles.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what's the pool up to?}
<A>__{upham smiles, caught.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{over three hundred.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i will tell you what, if i'm still alive when it hits five hundred, i will let you know and we'll split the money.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{if that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't expect to live that long.}
<A>__{upham looks closely at miller and sees that he means it.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{five hundred, then.}
<A>__{miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to feel an overwhelming wave of sadness. then he turns himself back into a commander and barks at upham.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's go, private.}
<A>__{miller strides away. upham watches him, trying to figure him out, then he simply follows him.}
