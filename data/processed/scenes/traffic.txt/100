<A>__{the prosecutor sits. carl's defense lawyer, michael adler, from the georgetown party, stands and speaks.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{my client is no more a flight risk than your honor or the able prosecutor. he is a pillar of his community, a family man with a wife and child in la jolla, the community where he has made his home for over twenty years. as our defense will quickly show, my client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an admitted criminal. therefore we ask that you release carl ayala on his own recognizance.}

<C>__{judge}
