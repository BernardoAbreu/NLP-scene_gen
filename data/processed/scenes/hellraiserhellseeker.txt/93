<A>__{trevor sits at a tape recorder. lange sits across from him.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{for the last time. i honestly don't know how any of them died...}
<A>__{lange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose. he nods at trevor and walks out. no sooner has the door closed when it opens again and givens walks in. givens gets right in trevor's face.}
<C>__{givens}
<D>__{now i want you to tell me what you remember happening in your own words exactly the way you told detective lange. but this time i want you to make one small adjustment.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{givens whirls around revealing lange's face on the back of his head!}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{don't fucking lie to me!}
<A>__{trevor thinks a moment. he is absolutely numb. he smiles a little insanely.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i did it. i killed them all. i confess.}
