<A>__{very close (magnification) on the sliced cocoon, as roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis.}
<C>__{roden }
<D>__{the whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it... the wings are just like wet tissue paper...}
<B>__{the two men}
<A>__{are hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays. clarice watches curiously. of their two specimens, pilcher's moth is in much better condition a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper.}
<C>__{pilcher}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{what do you do when you're not detecting, officer starling?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i try to be a student, dr. pilcher.}
<C>__{pilcher}
<D>__{ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? the amusing house wine...?}

<C>__{roden }
<D>__{better known to his friends as the death's head moth...}
<C>__{pilcher }
<D>__{the latin name comes from two rivers in hell. your man he drops these girls into rivers, every time. didn't i read that?}
<B>__{favoring clarice}
<A>__{as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.}
<C>__{clarice}

<C>__{pilcher}
