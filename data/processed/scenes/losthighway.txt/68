<L>__{interior andy's house night}
<A>__{a swinging party is in progress at andy's house the man whose face we saw at the luna lounge with renee. andy, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed. the people here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold chain wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin tight dresses. through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi nude people cavorting in a swimming pool. everyone has a drink in his or her hand. renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to fred who walks away with it. andy grabs renee, and dances with her. they laugh and talk. renee appears to be a bit intoxicated. fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. when the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar. then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass. a mystery man, tall, well dressed and groomed, older than fred, approaches him.}
