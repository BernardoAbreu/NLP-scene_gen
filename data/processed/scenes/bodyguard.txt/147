<L>__{exterior farmer house night}
<A>__{details are barely distinguishable in the fog. we hear the gentle lapping of the lakewater against the dock.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{fletcher is asleep, snuggled on herb's lap by the fire. herb is also asleep. frank fetches a blanket and gently covers them both. he puts out the light.}
<L>__{interior entrance hall night}
<A>__{frank steps quietly into the hall. nicki is standing in the shadows. she watches as frank goes through the ritual of locking the front door, several ways.}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you're very thorough.}
<A>__{various shots around interior frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first floor, checking windows and doors. nicki tags along.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{what's happening between you and rachel?}
<A>__{frank glances at her.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{come on. one minute she's got magnetic hands, the next she hates you. i can't figure out what it is now.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you follow all her moves this closely?}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{it's a living.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, it isn't.}
<A>__{he moves away into the next room. she hesitates a moment, then follows.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{you think my life is pretty sickly, don't you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{you must. i do.}
<A>__{frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove, checks the windows.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why don't you change it?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{is it that easy?}
<A>__{frank turns from the window to find nicki blocking his exit. she moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his shoulders. the kiss ends and they look at each other.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're a lovely woman.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{but you don't want me.}
<A>__{frank's look affirms it. nicki is embarrassed, angry.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i'm surprised. thorough fellow like you. why stop at one sister when you can fuck them both?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i make my mistakes.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{but you didn't say no to the boss.}
<A>__{she starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away. their faces are very close. it is tight and near here.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(with force)}
<D>__{no, don't go away, nicki. don't leave me with that. tell me about it. tell me how long you've been second. tell me how she has a child and you don't. tell me something. but don't turn away and try to stick it on me.}
<A>__{nicki twists in his grip. he holds her tight.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i don't need this from you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe i need it. i'm fed up with people telling me they have no control over their lives. if you hate your life so much, turn it around.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{it's not so simple.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes it is. you can walk out that fucking door anytime you want. i will unlock it for you.}
<A>__{nicki looks up into his face. tears start in her eyes.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{let me go.}
<A>__{he releases her, looks at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. it's not my business.}
<A>__{he moves away, out of frame. we hold on nicki, a long time.}
