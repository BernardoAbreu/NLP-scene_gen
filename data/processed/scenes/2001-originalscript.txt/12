<L>__{exterior caves killing the lion}
<A>__{with the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the pointerior he hope the boulder would impact, moonwatcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights. on the third the lion comes, betraying his presences by a small pebble slide. when they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat, they strain themselves against the massive boulder. the sound of the lion stops; he is listening. again they silently heave against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their strength. the rock begin to tip to a new balance pointerior. the lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life; he goes back to his meal. the rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with amazing suddeness. it strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward. just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the onrushing boulder. he has combined the errors of overconfidence and bad luck. the next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. they also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory. and then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even moonwatcher ever thought of it again. he was still wholly unaware of all that it had done.}
