<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{i believe he's one of the prophets. god speaks through him. i recognize the cadence in his voice.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{this is unbearable. no wonder i feel lonely. i'm surrounded by morrons.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{mama, you're being ridiculous.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{am i? i sit here and listen to this talk of love and god and equality, knowing full well that count generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.}

<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{stop it! stop writing now!}
<A>__{valentin glances at sasha, uncomfortable at these outbursts. a long pause. dushan tries to relieve the tension.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{in defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. it's quite remarkable, really.}
<A>__{he gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on the record. what comes forth is not music, but tolstoy's voice. it is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment. his voice booms, tinny and distorted. dushan walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. valentin is completely caught up in the technology.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it's your voice. it's wonderful.}
<A>__{they all listen for a moment, look to tolstoy for a response.}

<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{please excuse me.}
<A>__{tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn. dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. tea spills. valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of irritable blessings.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{leo nikolayevich is something of a luddite, i fear.}
<A>__{sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the gramophone, replaces it with another dushan has brought. suddenly, the air is filled with the final duet from mozart's il nozze di figaro. she returns to her place. there is a long moment where all take in the sublimity of it. tolstoy walks slowly back to the table. he stands completely still. tears fill his eyes and roll down his cheeks.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{oh, that s better. that s nice. very nice indeed.}
<A>__{sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face. valentin watches as they embrace.}

<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{my mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary. his commitment to the spiritual life offends her. they've fought about it for years.}

<A>__{sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{he's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. he told me so himself. i think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. when he was your age, he was whoring in the caucasus.}
<A>__{valentin's eyes are wide. she nods.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{he wrote it all down. he even gave me a copy, so i could read all the details...}

<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{he's given me an extraordinary opportunity.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but you see what a fool he is, a self serving puritanical idiot. i have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.}
<A>__{sofya smiles. valentin is nonplussed by her directness.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{when my husband was writing it, in the mid sixties, he'd bring me pages to re copy everyday. i was the only one who could read his handwriting. i could read his intentions, too. afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. "natasha wouldn't say that to prince andrey," or "pierre's too simple here. he's not stupid."}
<A>__{she smiles at the memory.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but i don't count anymore.}

<D>__{you must help me, valentin fedorovich. i want only what is best for my husband and my family. i could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me what i can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. do you know i was the only person. i could understand his intention.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i don't believe anyone wants to do that.}
<A>__{sofya gives him a condescending smile. she produces a package from the table beside her, hands it to him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i have a little gift for you}
<A>__{he opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. he stares at it.}

<C>__{masha}
<D>__{and what relations are these?}
<A>__{valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe. he bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. he glances up to see her still looking at him. he pounds again and again. she stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does. she lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head, bringing it down hard. the log splits. she hands the axe to him.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{i had a lover before i came here... headmaster of a school where i taught. he was married happily married. it was difficult. we could make love only at school.}

<D>__{yes. you know, i think that i... never mind.}
<A>__{he hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. her back is to him. she begins to chop again. the color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity. he grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. red faced, he rights himself. the chopping behind him remains constant. sergeyenko watches him from the porch.}
