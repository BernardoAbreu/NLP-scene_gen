<L>__{exterior park avenue day}
<A>__{joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury apartment houses. o.s. the torchy woman's voice sings joe's love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a fire bell, a screech of brakes. joe's spirits rise as he hears the tic tac tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click clack click of his boots. he adjusts his pace to arrive at the corner at the same time as a smart and in joe's eyes very rich lady. joe grins boyishly, holding his stetson over his heart.}
