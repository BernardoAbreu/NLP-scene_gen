<L>__{exterior underwater night (tank)}
<A>__{as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. track to find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely.}
<B>__{jason is gone.}
<L>__{interior houseboat continuous}
<A>__{suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. the black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which jim has left open. an uncomfortable amount of time passes.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{jimmy...?}
<A>__{no answer. her heart starts to pound.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{jim...?}
<A>__{again, nothing. she wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. the ship creaks again. suzy's point of view as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch black beyond it.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{stop screwing around, jim. i mean it...}
<A>__{...and just as she reaches the door:}
<B>__{a hockey masked monster}
<A>__{leaps out, clutching a huge knife. suzy barely has time to scream before jason plunges the knife into her chest.}
<B>__{suzy}
<A>__{stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. but there's no blood.}
<B>__{the monster}
<A>__{pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. it's a retractable rubber knife. jim pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{gotcha good, baby cakes.}
<A>__{she doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. he pulls her back onto the bed, laughing.}
