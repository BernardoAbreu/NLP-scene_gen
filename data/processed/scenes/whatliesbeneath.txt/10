<C>__{norman}
<D>__{did you...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{they listen. the sounds start to become louder. it is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he walks over and closes the window. it doesn't help.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i guess they're making up.}
<A>__{the woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what is he doing to her?}
<A>__{they lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and we moved out here for the quiet.}
