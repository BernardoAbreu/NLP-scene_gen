<L>__{exterior fbi academy grounds, quantico, virginia day}
<A>__{crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, as clarice joins him. he looks tired, haunted. between master and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{starling, clarice m., good morning.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{good morning, mr. crawford.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{your instructors tell me you're doing well. top quarter of the class.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i hope so. they haven't posted anything.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{a job's come up and i thought about you. not really a job, more of an interesting errand. walk me to my car, starling.}
<A>__{they begin to cross the academy grounds. a group of trainees jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{we're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. could be a big help in unsolved cases. most of them have been happy to talk to us. they have a compulsion to boast, these people... do you spook easily, starling?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. i want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{who's the subject?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{the psychiatrist dr. hannibal lecter.}
<A>__{clarice stops walking, goes very still. a beat.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{the cannibal...}
<A>__{crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes, well... okay, right. i'm glad for the chance, sir, but why me?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you're qualified and available. and frankly, i can't spare a real agent right now.}
<A>__{he walks on again, at a faster clip. she hurried to keep up.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i don't expect him to talk to you, but i have to be able to say we tried... lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist, and he knows all the dodges.}
<P>__{(hands her the manila envelope)}
<D>__{dossier on him, copy of our questionnaire, special id for you... if he won't talk, then i want straight reporting. how's he look, how's his cell look, what's he writing? the director himself will see your report, over your own signature if i decide it's good enough. i want that by 0800 wednesday, and keep this to yourself.}
<A>__{they're reached his car. his driver stamps on a cigarette, climbs in behind the wheel. burroughs, his assistant, says something into a walkie talkie, then opens the back door. but crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. his intensity is scary.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{now. i want your full attention, starling. are you listening to me?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{be very careful with hannibal lecter. dr. chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. do not deviate from them, for any reason. you tell him nothing personal, starling. believe me, you don't want hannibal lecter inside your head... just do your job, but never forget what he is.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(a bit unnerved)}
<D>__{and what is that, sir?}
<C>__{chilton }
<D>__{oh, he's a monster. a pure psychopath...}
