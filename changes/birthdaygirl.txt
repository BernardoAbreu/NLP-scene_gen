<DIAL>__{"BIRTHDAY GIRL" Screenplay by Tom Butterworth and Jez Butterworth}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun.}
<TRANS>__{FADE THROUGH SUN TO:}
<ACTION>__{An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to move. We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond. We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path and into a suburban garden. We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing his house, setting down a mug of tea.}

That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air. Blackout. Music. Titles. The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.}

John wanders away from the gate. He stands about in the swirl in the middle of the airport. People bustle by. Everyone going somewhere. Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. A woman stands nearby. She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired and laden with luggage.}

It has burnt out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip. He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer.

They watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the control and smoking. After another long pause she flips the button -- The Money Programme. Antiques Roadshow. Rugby. She flips again then hands the controls back to John and they watch University Challenge. Nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns.}

She reaches down and takes his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts. She unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside. He's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his mouth. Her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip his fly. He lets out a moan. We concentrate on their faces. Above the silence all we can hear is John's breathing -- Before long Nadia looks down -- He's come. Nadia turns and walks out, leaving John marooned, gasping in and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers.}

At the bank, John walks to his desk. His phone rings. He answers it. Silence. Then soft breathing. John listens intently and looks around. "Nadia...?" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, listening to Nadia breathe. Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a woman's wrist. Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes fixed on John. John running by the river. John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the room. He stares out the window. Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully. Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and attaching them to suspenders. The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks over the close. Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half finished. The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They ask him if he's staying for another. A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly-finished jumper. Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck. His eyes are fixed on hers. Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom. The guitar theme ends.}

A policeman is standing reading The English-Russian Dictionary. We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room. An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the bed. He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points them out to a detective. They exchange a knowing grin. A photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a blinding flash. The birthday cake is there, half eaten. A Policewoman puts it in a baggy. We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph of Nadia with the binoculars.
