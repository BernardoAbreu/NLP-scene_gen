<A>__{welles marches across the set and squirms into position at the camera, which is right on the floor, and peers up through the viewfinder. toland lies next to him. mank stands to one side and watches.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's just not low enough. this is the scene. we have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. as towering virtues in combat }
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{spare me the aria, i know what you want }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there !}
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{i know what you want but it can't be done!}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{take apart the fucking camera rig we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up }
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{orson we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!}
<A>__{welles thinks for a moment and then bolts up. toland watches, mystified, as welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a fire axe. welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high. toland quickly rolls away. and welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of the set. he continues to hack at the floor.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{come on, gregg! we'll tear out this floor!}
<A>__{welles and toland and various grips hack at the floor mank watches, bemused, and checks his watch welles and toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor. they stare down, defeated. under the wood is solid concrete. welles and toland stand and stare at the concrete}
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{it's midnight, why don't we pick it up tomorrow?}
<A>__{welles does not answer. he continues to eye the concrete then:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{get me a jackhammer.}
<A>__{we see a grip pounding away at the concrete with a jackhammer as welles, always in motion, sweeps past mank and joseph cotton.}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(wryly, to cotton)}
<D>__{there but for the grace of god, goes god.}
<A>__{welles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out an arm. the physician injects him with a dose of b 12. welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off. welles supervises as toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole in the middle of the sound stage. mank checks his watch, 3:30 am. welles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup. again we see the view through the black and white viewfinder. joseph cotton stands at a distance, at the far wall of the set.}
<C>__{welles' voice}
<D>__{okay, joe . . . come closer . . . closer}
<A>__{we see cotton approaching. he finally stops inches away from the camera. his shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus. it is a breathtaking, vertiginous shot. then we see welles and joseph cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and filming and filming the scene. endlessly finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{"well, if you got drunk to talk to me about miss alexander, don't bother. i'm not interested. i've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? all right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. it's obvious the people prefer jim gettys to me."}
<C>__{joseph cotton}
<D>__{"you talk about the people as if you owned them. as though they belonged to you. as long as i can remember, you've talked about " (he breaks}
<P>__{character)}
<D>__{orson, i am so goddamn tired }
<A>__{we continue to watch the scene through the viewfinder:}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(to the camera operator)}
<D>__{keep filming.}
<C>__{joseph cotton}
<D>__{i can't remember the lines!}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{then make them up! you're drunk and you're angry.}
<A>__{he shoves joseph cotton brutally}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{this is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!}
<C>__{joseph cotton}
<D>__{we're not all hopped up on benzedrine, orson i some of us humans need sleep!}
<A>__{welles shoves him again.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you're not going to get another chance, boy! look right at the monster and you tell him }
<C>__{joseph cotton}
<P>__{(deeply)}
<D>__{"you don't care about anything except you. you just want to persuade people that you}
<C>__{joseph cotton }
<D>__{love them so much that they ought to love you back. only you want love on your own terms. "}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{"a toast then, jedediah, to love on my own terms. those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."}
<A>__{welles kane drinks. a long pause.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{cut. print}
<A>__{we jump out of the black and white viewfinder and into the scene as welles turns to an assistant.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{how 'bout a real drink?}
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{we done?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the crew members exhale and practically collapse welles stands and looks around in satisfaction. he takes in the empty corners of the sound stage, the sets, the cameras savoring the moment.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's finished.}
<A>__{he walks to the massive doors of the sound stage and pulls them open. sunlight floods in. outside it is a blazing morning and the dazzling sunlight silhouettes welles. welles squints and steps into the glorious sunlight. mank and toland follow. they stand and watch as rko extras and crews bustle about on their way to work. the assistant brings a tray of martinis. they each take a glass. the rko workers stare at them oddly as they pass. welles toasts them.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{good morning, good morning. . .}
<A>__{he grabs a passing extra and dances with her as mank and toland laugh.}
