<A>__{kimberly "comes to" at the wheel flailing desperately at the steering wheel. she even claws at thomas who tries to control the neglected steering wheel.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{slow down! we're...}
<A>__{kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars are backed up at a stop sign. kimberly screams and slams on the brakes. the truck skids on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a landscaping truck parked on the shoulder. kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty feet into the air, dukes of hazzard style. and lands miraculously without a scratch! on a parallel road. and keeps going. dumb, insane fucking luck. kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window. she turns around with a cocky smile. she rubs her throat and floors it again to thomas' horror, more determined.}

<D>__{what did you see? what am i looking for?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{no, it's not here. this one was different. more like the pile up and the van going into the lake. it wasn't just a sign, i was there.}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{another premonition?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{yes. i was in a hospital. there was screaming... a nurse was choking me. i couldn't tell wh at she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. kalarjian.}
