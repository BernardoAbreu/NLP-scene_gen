<A>__{a very poor township outside johannesburg. a stark reminder of how much work mandela has ahead of him. a stampede of kids runs by. we follow the kids and find a small, beat up church. a noisy line of threadbare kids leads from outside into the church. there is a pecking order in the line, based on size.}
