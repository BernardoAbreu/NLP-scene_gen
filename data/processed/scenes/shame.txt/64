<A>__{above, the tall, endless glass of the standard hotel, scored with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny still lives. brandon comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans. above him, engraved in stone is "1949." he looks up toward the tall building, which appears like a stasi east berlin building. stark and authoritative. a kid slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window, a filipino nanny ushers him away. a woman, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans and t shirt, paces along the window. catching sight of brandon, she pulls the curtain along the length of the glass. a man stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up. a female cleaner just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster. and then brandon sees her a middle aged woman stands, naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the hudson river. the steady back and forth of the middle aged man behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck. brandon hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment brandon's eyes lock with the middle aged woman's dead gaze, standing high above a car horn loud unremitting brandon turns, his hypnotism broken. it's as if he comes back to himself.}
