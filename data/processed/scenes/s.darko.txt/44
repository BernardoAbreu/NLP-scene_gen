<L>__{interior motel room 15 later night}
<A>__{corey awakens to the sound of a little boy crying. she sits up in bed. the clock radio reads 3:30 am. the crying is faint but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming from outside...}
<L>__{exterior motel night}
<A>__{corey follows the distinctive crying toward the vending machines on the side of the building... ...until billy moorcroft emerges from behind them. corey freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the birthday hat, slacks and collared shirt. he is pale and bruised. corey sees that he is not crying it's coming from elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. the wails taper off to a faint, distorted whisper as billy speaks:}
<C>__{billy moorcroft}
<D>__{you need to save me, corey.}
<A>__{corey stares at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{billy moorcroft }
<D>__{you need to save me... and save the world.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{why can't anyone see you?}
<C>__{billy moorcroft}
<D>__{if you tell them about me they'll think you're a dummy.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{billy moorcroft}
<D>__{i didn't pick you. just like you didn't pick me either.}
<A>__{corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.}
<C>__{billy moorcroft }
<D>__{we shouldn't even be here. nobody should...}
<A>__{corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. where the prices should be, numbers flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant crying: 2... .. 16... 44... end ... 2... 10... 16... 44... end ...}
<C>__{billy moorcroft }
<D>__{you don't have much time.}
<A>__{corey is about to respond when the sound of a door opening stops her. the flashing numbers on the vending machines go back to normal prices, the crying sound ceases, and billy disappears.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{what's goin' on out here?}
<A>__{corey looks over and sees phil dressed in nightclothes, having come out of a room near the lobby. she's dumbstruck.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{nothing... i i don't know.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{go back to your room and get some sleep. you've had a tough day.}
<A>__{phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.}
