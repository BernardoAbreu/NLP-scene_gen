<L>__{interior backstage night}
<A>__{to scattered applause, hoots and whistles, salome flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the narrow corridor to her dressing room. she's about to enter when:}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{excuse me, miss salome.}
<A>__{she turns. deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum ble, sleazy persistence. he comes closer with his shit eating grin.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'd like to have a word with you if i could.}
<A>__{salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'm with the american federation of variety artists...}
<A>__{he holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm not here to make you join that's not my department.}
<A>__{he glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be there.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'm an investigator for the confidential committee on moral abuses.}
<A>__{she nods, taking it a little more seriously.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{there's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{i don't know nothing about it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?}
<A>__{she's definitely puzzled.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{how do you mean 'exploited'?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{like to get this position. did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{are you for real?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{oh, yeah. you'd be surprised what goes on around here. i'd like to check the dressing room if i could.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{what the fuck for?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{for holes.}
<A>__{this guy might be an asshole but he's funny.}
<C>__{salome}
<D>__{i don't believe this.}
<A>__{she shrugs and they go in.}
