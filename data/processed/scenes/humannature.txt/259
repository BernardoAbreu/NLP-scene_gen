<D>__{no, puff. this man is a midget. in actuality, they prefer to be called "little people." isn't that correct, my good man?}
<C>__{midget}
<D>__{yes sir. little people.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{this little person is actually a fully grown adult man, puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is miniature but perfectly proportioned.}

<C>__{midget}
<P>__{(loud and scary)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{nathan and gabrielle hurry into the case. the midget closes and locks the door behind them. puff is frozen with fear. lila enters. she looks different now. savage. strong. kind of sexy. she wears guerilla like black clothing and a beret over her closely hacked off hair. she also carries a gun.}

<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{that's lila?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{shut up! yeah, this is lila, cunt. and don't let the hirsutism fool you. i know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. i know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{see, frank and i are kindred spirits. we both know what it's like to be shunned because of our appearance. we both know how easily that turns into self hatred.}
