<L>__{78b exterior sir thomas' house day}
<A>__{holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by constable clark.}
<L>__{interior sir thomas' bathroom}
<A>__{holmes is briefed by constable clark as they enter. as constable clark continues in, holmes swivels away }
<C>__{constable clark}
<D>__{we've checked everything. no sign of a break in. the butler didn't hear anything. the body was in the tub, eyes wide open }
<A>__{ so that const. clark ends up talking to thin air.}
<C>__{constable clark}
<P>__{(realizing holmes isn't there)}
<D>__{ only his ring was missing.}
<A>__{he turns, puzzled, looking for holmes, finds him right back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode. right now, right here is where holmes is at his very best this is, in fact, why he exists. holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues into the bathroom, where a police officer stands over the tub and sir thomas' body (covered with a blanket). the tub has been drained. the kind of crime scene violation that holmes cannot get them to stop doing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why did you drain the water?}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{out of common decency.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(incensed)}
<D>__{crime is common, logic is rare. the decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse.}
<A>__{neither the officer nor clark have a response. holmes swivels, sees a jar of bath salts on the table next to the chair blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hmm...}
<A>__{holmes thrusts the open jar under the officer's nose.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{police officer}
<P>__{(smelling)}
<D>__{uhhhh... jasmine?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{superb. i suspect this comes from a larger cannister. it'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. and, constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own.}
<A>__{both cops hesitate holmes is not their boss.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{data, data, data! i cannot make bricks without clay!}
<A>__{the cops hurry away. now holmes can really get down to work. this may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's eye view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill. sometimes he hums or sings to himself. holmes is happy. he glances around the room, sees the chair where blackwood was perched, sits in it himself. his eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. he steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust. the dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open. holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of talcum powder and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing: fingerprints on one of the panels. he pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to reveal a secret room. holmes enters }
