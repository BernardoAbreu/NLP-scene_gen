<A>__{suzanne sits by the side of the road. a car pulls into the shot. jay and silent bob climb over the cliff onto the highway just in time to see the passenger door slamming on a truck with los angeles plates and a sign that reads critters of hollywood. suzanne is looking out the back window waving. jay and bob leap to their feet, chasing after the truck.}
