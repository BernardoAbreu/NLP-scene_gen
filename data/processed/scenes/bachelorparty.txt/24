<L>__{interior cole's smokehouse day}
<A>__{debbie opens a rustic looking door and peers in.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole?}
<C>__{cole }
<D>__{over here, deb... in the smokehouse.}
<A>__{camera pans with debbie as she enters the room. she passes several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall. she makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling. finally we see cole whittier, a steve garvey look alike... rugged all american, and heir to the whittier plastic wrap fortune. despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is definitely unsavory. as debbie approaches him we see that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him. (note: for the squeamish, all of this is done out of frame. the only thing we should hear are the delightful sounds of taxidermy.)}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{hi, deb. just got back from the mountains.}
<P>__{(as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill)}
<D>__{isn't this a beauty?... it's gonna look great in the den.}
<A>__{debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole, we've got to talk.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, cole, i...}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(lifting an organ of some sort o.s.)}
<D>__{it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole, listen to me... i've got to tell you...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she'll be back. god wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole, i'm marrying rick.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you're marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.}
<A>__{cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at debbie intensely. then he returns to his work with a renewed enthusiasm, chopping, slashing and slicing.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{angry, deb.}
<P>__{(a little louder)}
<D>__{yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.}
<P>__{(a little nuts)}
<D>__{no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole, i'm sorry, i...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{that's all right, deb. go be happy and smile a lot, deb. do it for me.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i'm going now, cole.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i understand, deb. 'bye... be happy.}
<A>__{debbie exits and we push in on cole. something on his face says, "hi! i'm really out of my mind."}
