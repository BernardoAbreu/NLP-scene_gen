<A>__{mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past the tables when... ... she's grabbed by duncan. he gets her in a good tight come along. like any good security person, the hold is not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted. vita minh steps up next to her, closing ranks. mace is walked around behind the bandstand. joey corto walks up to her, looking mean and smug. mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur. her open palm breaks corto's nose with an audible crunch. corto screams and grabs his face.}

<D>__{aw, not the fucking nose!!}
<A>__{she slams her foot down on duncan's instep and snaps her head back simultaneously in a reverse head butt. he keeps the hold. mace drives her free hand back into the approximate position of his nuts. even though duncan looks like he bench presses buicks, this has the desired effect. mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a buffet table. vita draws a knife in a lightning move but... suddenly mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight armed, with the muzzle right in her face. vita says the smartest line of the night.}

<D>__{hey, enjoy the party.}
<A>__{mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her gun innocuously tight to her side. she spots a red "exit" sign above a fire door and goes through.}
