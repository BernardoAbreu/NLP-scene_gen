<A>__{beth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled pillow, but he is not in bed. she looks at the time, gets up, puts on a robe.}
<L>__{interior stairs night}
<A>__{beth goes downstairs, tying up her robe. she stops, hearing someone sobbing in the dark, in the dining room.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{beth enters the dining room in the dark.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{calvin?}
<A>__{calvin is sitting at table in the dark, sobbing, his head in his hands.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{why are you crying?}
<A>__{calvin doesn't answer.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{can i, uh... can i get you something?}
<A>__{calvin mutters in a very low voice.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{calvin sits back in his chair.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{calvin. what did you say?}
<A>__{calvin produces a very deep sigh.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you are beautiful. and you are unpredictable. but you're so cautious. you're determined, beth. but you know something? you're not strong. and i don't know if you're really giving. beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{tell me something. do you love me? do you really love me?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i feel the way i've always felt about you.}
<A>__{calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{we would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. but you can't handle mess. you need everything neat and ...easy. i don't know. maybe you can't love anybody. it was so much buck. and buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and i don't understand that. i just don't know.}
<A>__{calvin sighs.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{maybe it wasn't even buck. maybe it was just you. maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{but whatever it was, i don't know who you are. i don't know what we've been playing at. so i was crying.}
<A>__{calvin is overcome by sadness}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{'t know if i love you anymore. and i don't know what i am going to do without that.}
<A>__{beth does not know what to say or do. she turns away and goes upstairs.}
