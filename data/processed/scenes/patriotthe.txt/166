<A>__{marion stands at the american battlements, looking out at the british defensive works. above him, stars are visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre dawn glow from the horizon. marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the north star, but in the increasingly harsh light of this day, he can't find it. he turns his eyes back to the battlefield.}
<L>__{exterior yorktown battlefield day}
<A>__{the sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards. men move like ghosts. the camera finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist. there is no overview, just separate detachments: an orderly regiment of continental cavalry, mounted, waiting, steadying their horses. two long lines of continental infantry reserves... an american command, including washington, lafayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners... and, finally, marion and his men, who stand in the middle of a long line of patriot militia in the center of a long, valley line depression. they stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew covered grass in front of them. they're all grim. they know what's coming. then, the sound of a single drum, heard but unseen, coming from over the slope... then, more drums, more and more, a competition of drum}

<A>__{marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them. marion motions for his officers, dalton, scott, rev. oliver and several other patriot militia officers from other units. they quickly gather around.}

<D>__{we are the bait in a trap. we're militia. cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers. and if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. listen up.}
