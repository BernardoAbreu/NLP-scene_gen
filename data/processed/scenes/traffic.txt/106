<L>__{interior caroline wakefield's bathroom morning}
<A>__{caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom. she's not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her pajamas. she's reading a magazine. the exhaust fan is on. there are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with cutouts from magazine pictures and copy. on the sink next to her is a little square of well charred aluminum foil; she's done many hits. she leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish. she drops it on a clean place on the foil. she picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's turned into a straw. she heats the bottom of the foil. the crack "crackles." she chases the smoke across the foil. a huge hit. she leans her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling. she holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan. caroline looks at her watch. it's 7:20. she stands suddenly, unsteadily. she looks at herself in the mirror. she's really high and indecisive. she looks around wildly. she sees the shower. she turns it on. she drops her pajamas. she goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, taking another really big hit. she crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet. she hops in the shower.}
<B>__{in the shower}
<A>__{the water streams over her face. after a long beat she finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and steam. she's in ecstacy. it's almost time to leave for school.}
