<L>__{26: interior mercedes sedan. city of eureka. night.}
<A>__{melted neon in the streets. a wet mid town night. nothing but sound of windshield wipers and click of a zippo lighter. ross rides stoic passenger while berlin drives with festering eyes.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{.. what does he think it is? berlin [ross] everything it isn't [make a left]. he even tried a "self inflicted."}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{c'mon, ross, the bra and hand were in different bags a 100 feet apart ..}
<A>__{they stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind.}
<D>__{what's she gonna do? dump her bra in one bag, her hand in the other, and wander off whistling hey jude?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{it's the garage on the far corner.}
<A>__{berlin is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the zippo.}
<D>__{you can't stop it, can you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{worrying clicking picking you may as well be back in los angeles.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what do you mean, ross?}
<A>__{the lights change and off they go and berlin waits for a turn.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{why don't you dump it? mail it off. give the fucking f.b.i. a present?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{why don't you dump the "fat lady?"}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{because i dislike her too much ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{ok. and i'm not in love with this fukker? that's how i feel about him.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no you don't. that's how you think you feel about him. that's how you feel about yourself. you won't give yourself one fucking minute for you.}
<A>__{and by now they've arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt. it's indicative of their friendship that ross can talk like this.}
<D>__{wait for me. it might not be ready.}
<A>__{he quits the car and berlin watches him scurry towards a service shop. rain beats on the roof and berlin looks stubbed out. a lot of cuts coming up and here are some of them. runs a hand through his hair in unconscious frustration. a finger constantly bothers the zippo. eyes towards ross who silhouettes in florescent light. somewhere in the background the lights change to red. once again the beeping sound of traffic lights speaking to the blind. maybe he looks across but that doesn't matter. something just happens inside his head he isn't yet quite aware of. everything in close up. big on the zippo. big on berlin. and he leaps out of the car. berlin sprints through the weather. a station wagon is still in the air at the end of an hydraulic jack. surprise from ross and a mechanic as berlin arrives. fuck the fanbelt and listen to this.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i just had this insane idea if i'm wrong, i will take a week off and redecorate your entire house ..}
<A>__{rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them.}
<D>__{she's blind, ross that's why all the scars hear that traffic light? that noise is to help blind people that's why the marks on her finger tips? this lady reads in braille ..}
