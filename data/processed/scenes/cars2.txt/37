<A>__{post race press conference. francesco is center stage.}
<C>__{darrell cartrip}
<D>__{francesco, over here! hey, what was your strategy today?}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{strategia? francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. you start the race, wait for lightning mcqueen to choke, pass him, then win. francesco always wins. it's boring.}
<A>__{mcqueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. he suddenly notices something o.s. mcqueen's p.o.v. it's mater, appearing from a side street, moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.}

<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{to truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high.}
<A>__{in mcqueen's pit garage mater looks around for everyone as mcqueen approaches.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<A>__{hey mcqueen! what happened? is the race over? you won, right?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{mater, why were you yelling things at me while i was racing?}

<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{a flamethrower? what are you talking about? i don't understand. where were you?}
<C>__{mater}
<A>__{going to meet my date.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{your date?}
<C>__{mater}
<A>__{she started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go }
<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{mater}
<A>__{wait a minute i didn't screw you up, did i?}
<C>__{mcqueen}

<C>__{mcqueen}
<A>__{an imaginary girlfriend, flamethrowers. this is exactly why i don't bring you along to these things.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{maybe if i, i don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened i could help.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i don't need your help. i don't want your help.}
<C>__{press }
<D>__{hey, there he is!!}
<A>__{the press finds mcqueen, swarms him. mater is pushed backwards as the questions fly again.}
<C>__{press}
<D>__{ mcqueen, you had it in the bag! yeah, what happened?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i made a mistake. but i can assure you, it won't happen again.}
