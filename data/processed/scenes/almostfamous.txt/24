<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{william listens intently as lester eat a sandwich. his face is an open book filling with words.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{ so anyway, you're from san diego and that's good.}
<A>__{because once you go}
<D>__{to l.a., you're gonna have friends like crazy but they'll be fake friends, they're gonna try to corrupt you. the publicists! the bands! you got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything.}
<A>__{but you cannot make friends}
<D>__{with the rock stars.}
<A>__{the kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures can i make a note? bangs nods.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{cannot make friends with the rock stars.}
<P>__{(savage bite)}
<D>__{that's what's important. if you're a rock journalist, a true journalist first you will never get paid much. but you will get free records from the record company.}
<A>__{the kid's eyes widen. bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{and they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls... they'll try to fly you places for free.... offer you drugs... i know. it sounds great. but they are not your friends.}
<A>__{these are people who want you}
<D>__{to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it.}
<A>__{privately, william thrills. we. our. it all sounds great to him. he listens to the grouping of the words, every one of them. he madly scribbles.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{they are trying to buy respectability for a form that is gloriously and righteously }
<A>__{the kid leans forward as lester finds the right word.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{ dumb!}
<A>__{and you're smart enough to}
<D>__{know that. and the day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real.}
<A>__{right? and then it will just}
<D>__{become an industry of cool.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{... industry... of... cool...}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{and that's what they want!}
<A>__{and it's}
<D>__{happening right now. i'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll. the war is over. they won. 99% of what passes for rock now... silence is much more compelling. it's over. i think you should turn around and go back and be... a lawyer or something... but i can see from your face that you won't. i can pay you thirty five bucks. gimme a thousand words on black sabbath.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(attempting cool)}
<D>__{an assignment.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{yeah. and you should build your reputation on being honest... and unmerciful.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(writing in notebook)}
<D>__{honest... unmerciful...}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{and if you get into a jam call me. i stay up late.}
<A>__{bangs reaches across the table, and william watches as he scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate notebook. the notebook has just become valuable. they sit together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.}
