<A>__{the doorbell rings. a houseboy comes into the front hall, goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. it is john clifford, the detective from six years ago. he has aged noticeably over the years. his hair is grayer, his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe occupation. no words are exchanged as the houseboy leads clifford across the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. still keen in his observation of things, clifford quickly takes in this new atmosphere. the house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme of melancholy. there are no bright or cheerful furnishings, and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady and reverent. the houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. without waiting for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for clifford to enter. clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be an upstairs study.}
