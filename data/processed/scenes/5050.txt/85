<L>__{interior adam's house night}
<A>__{adam jumps from bed in cold sweat.}
<L>__{interior synagogue. rabbi jacob's office day}
<A>__{adam is seated in the rabbi's office, he looks despondent.}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{so you want to know what's going to happen when you die?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i think it's a fair question.}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{fair yes, but impossible for me to answer. our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of god's plan. how should i know what god has planned for you. maybe if you came to service once in a while...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well am i going to go to heaven?}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what if i want to just die? that's it. no heaven.}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{that's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going. the afterlife is where the fun begins.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun. i spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now i'm going to have to spend an eternity with them.}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{adam, you can not look at death as a curse. even in death we are all still part of god. life on earth is just the beginning.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but that's not what i want.}
<C>__{rabbi}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{oy. then find another religion. i don't make the rules.}
