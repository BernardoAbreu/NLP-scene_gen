<L>__{exterior lincoln pulls up to motel and parks. interior motel restaurant night}
<A>__{a small roadside diner. a fair number of people inside having dinner. adele, early, carrie, and brian are seated at one of the tables.}
<B>__{at their table}
<A>__{carrie watches early eat with a kind of horrible, rude fascination. he has no table manners at all. he eats with his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right hand. all the while, he chews with his mouth open. he's serious about his "eating."}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(studying his map)}
<D>__{well we've come three hundred miles so far. not a bad day's haul.}
<A>__{early doesn't bother to respond. he keeps eating.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you got any family or friends in california, early?}
<B>__{cu angle on early}
<A>__{with a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{nope... you?}
<B>__{angle under the table}
<A>__{early's foot itches... he tries to scratch it but it doesn't do any good.}
<C>__{brian }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{me neither. how 'bout you carrie?}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{angle the group as brian folds up the map. early takes off his boot, then his well worn sock. carrie's look of disgust grows as early brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he eats. carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{...well, least we got each other. that's somethin'.}
<A>__{brian looks up, sees carrie's expression... then what's causing it... early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. he notices brian and carrie staring at him and slowly puts his foot back down on the floor then the sock. brian picks up the check to see the total... starts pulling his wallet out... isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab to early.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{thanks bri', i will get the next one.}
<P>__{(prompts adele)}
<D>__{think it's time we hit the sack.}
<A>__{early winks at brian, carrie catches the wink. early and adele get up and head for the door. adele waves goodnight.}

<P>__{(to carrie)}
<D>__{sweet dreams.}
