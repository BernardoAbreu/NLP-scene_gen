<L>__{interior throne room day}
<A>__{z follows formica and carpenter into the throne room. at the end of the hall, a society band is playing. the room is full of courtier ants and officers. waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wow, what a spread you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{yes, and do you know why there's a food shortage?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...not enough food?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{negatory. too many ants. and while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby pamby workers live it up back home.}
<A>__{feeling a little hot, z wipes his brow.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well i, i don't think "living it up" is the right term how about "working themselves to death"?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{i tell you son, sometimes, at night, i see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. and always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(spooked)}
<D>__{oh, hey, that's great, i think i see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. good luck with the hallucinations.}
<A>__{z escapes from formica, who gazes after him suspiciously. z mingles in with the crowd, then he sees princess bala standing with a group of officers who are eating hors d'oeuvres.}
<C>__{officer}
<P>__{(telling a joke)}
<D>__{what do you call it when 10,000 workers are killed in a tunnel cave in?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{who cares? they're workers!}
<A>__{the officers laugh, but bala looks bored in this stuffy social scene.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{but...don't you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony }
<P>__{(realizes he's getting odd looks)}
<D>__{i mean, uh, without them, who would we stand on?}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, if single handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes i am.}
<A>__{z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by, and knocks the whole thing clattering to the ground.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(feigning nonchalance)}
<D>__{and you are...?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm princess bala.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{ah, yes.}
<P>__{(affected)}
<D>__{well, charmed, i'm sure. so, princess, have you ever danced with a hero?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(deflated)}
<D>__{oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.}
<A>__{she moves towards the dance floor. z spit combs his antennae, struts after her until he trips on his sword. he tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as bala turns toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{just warming up...}
<A>__{she frowns...there's something familiar about this guy. but then they start dancing. across the room: the queen and general formica watch the party.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{all these parties are so marvellouslyalike.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{they should be...}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{but there's something funny about that soldier.}
<A>__{formica strides over to where z and bala are dancing.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(glowering)}
<D>__{may i cut in?}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(intimidated)}
<D>__{oh, of course }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(pulling z back)}
<D>__{no, general. i'm dancing with the war hero.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(trying to placate formica)}
<D>__{uh, sorry, general, i...i've always had this animal magnetism, it }
<A>__{bala yanks z back onto the dance floor, dancing away from formica.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you dance...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{divinely?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{no weirdly...you remind me of someone...}
<A>__{formica catches bala's eye. she frowns at him, and decides to get a little shocking.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{he was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual.}
<A>__{as she says these things, z tries to act accordingly.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{he was a worker. i danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. i'm not shocking you, am i?}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{no...as a matter of fact...}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{oh my god, it's you! you're a worker!!! a filthy, stupid, disgusting worker!}
<A>__{everybody gasps. the dancing stops cold.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, i think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i can't dance with a worker!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{that's not what you said the othernight }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(now she's panicked)}
<D>__{quiet sshhh!!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(digging it in)}
<D>__{ at the worker bar! you were pretty hot to trot then!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{sshh!!! sshh!!!}
<A>__{a livid formica is stalking over towards them.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{what's this? a worker has been masquerading as a war hero?!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what i'd call a clever ruse }
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{arrest him!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{can't we all settle this like adults we're not larvae anymore }
<A>__{angry officers begin to surround z, who hides behind bala in fear, using her as a shield.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{oh my god! he's taking her hostage!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{no i'm not i mean nobody move! or the princess gets it!}
<A>__{people shout and scream, as z backs up with the princess...into the kitchen.}
