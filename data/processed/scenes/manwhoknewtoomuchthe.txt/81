<L>__{interior arab restaurant (night) med. close shot}
<A>__{as the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners watch them the draytons out of idle curiosity, but the mckennas with growing astonishment as they realize that bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or speaking to them. jo turns back to ben.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{well just what do you think of that? first he promises to take us to dinner }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look, we only met him today. we can't expect him to change his whole life }
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{oh, ben! what's the matter with you?!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{nothing! what's the matter with you?!}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{can you blame him? turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{we're not an old married couple! all right he's a heel. i don't understand him and i'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.}
<A>__{drayton, quietly amused, is listening to ben and jo. but mrs. drayton is embarrassed. she makes conversation at random.}
<C>__{mrs. drayton}
<P>__{(to drayton)}
<D>__{i must do some shopping in the market tomorrow. i do hope it'll be fine. fine, but not too fine. of course, i how our english weather is awful, but i sometimes think we don't know when we're lucky. all this sunshine, day after day. it seems unnatural, somehow.}
<A>__{ben makes as if to rise, but jo holds him down.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i want to get up.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{ben, i know you once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. now please, sit down and forget him.}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(to the mckennas)}
<D>__{by the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{louis bernard, the big buyer from paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(starts to rise aaain)}
<D>__{good. i will just go over and cancel out.}
<A>__{she pushes him down again.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{ben, don't. our dinner's getting cold.}
<P>__{(to the draytons)}
<D>__{we'd love to go with you.}
<A>__{ben glares in bernard's direction, and then picks up a chicken leg.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i don't know why ben gets so worked up over unimportant things.}
<A>__{ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. then his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only three fingers. ben looks down at the chicken leg. he is holding it gripped in his fist. this is too much. he throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.}
