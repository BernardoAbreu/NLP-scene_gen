<ACTION>__{As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN. Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's). As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a HINT of EMPATHY on her face. He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter. She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw. We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING. Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.}

She speaks to her MOM.}

And... all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful... My mother... My mother taught me to love nature. And... I guess that was the most she could do. And... we had... In front of our house we had this big field... meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy.
