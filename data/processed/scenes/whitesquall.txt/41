<L>__{exterior shop}
<A>__{chuck and robin reappear, sipping cold cokes. mike and chris walk by across the street. robin speaks up loud enough for them to hear.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you're right chuck. there's nothing quite as refreshing as a cold ten cent coke that only costs ten cents!}
<A>__{the three clink their bottles. mike and chris slink away.}
<L>__{exterior colonial fort day}
<A>__{a crumbling fort overlooks the harbor. below, the albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water. large bronze muzzle loading cannons still lie in their gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that will never come. each of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the caribbean view.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you think skipper and alice do it?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{ya know... "it".}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. who wants to know?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she isn't that old.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i mean she looks pretty damn good in her all together for being thirty.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how would you know?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{trust me donut. i know.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what? come on...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{on the dog watch, night after the storm, i look down into the skylight above skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come on man, what'd they look like?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{damn, porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i've seen 'em. i've seen 'em.}
<A>__{they crack up.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i walked in on my parents one time. it was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's what they get for not locking the door.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{so i'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop. no breathing or snoring... suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{so... what happened?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "what?"}
<A>__{john and robin crack up.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what'd you do?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i said "sorry, wrong room" and walked away.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{did you shut the door at least?}
<A>__{they bust up again. chuck glares back.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<A>__{robin sits up on his cannon and looks out, suddenly melancholy.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my parents don't do it anymore.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{how do you know? they might.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{'cause they're getting a divorce.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's why they sent me here. my sister's at tabor. they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they tell you that?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i figured it out.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my old man split along time ago. it doesn't mean anything. you just take care of number one that's all that matters.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it matters to me.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{okay donut. whatever you say.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{we better get back.}
<A>__{robin looks up to john.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{did you really see 'em.}
