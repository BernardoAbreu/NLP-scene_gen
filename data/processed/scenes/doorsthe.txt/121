<L>__{interior miami auditorium night (1969)}
<A>__{crammed into every available space of an old seaplane hangar with no seats standing room only a mass of kids swelter in the heat, grumbling, fanning themselves with programs as a warm up band plays. in the wings of the stage, a radio dj critic is recording on tape. it's the same kid we saw long ago at the whiskey backstage, pronouncing the arrival of the doors on the scene. now he's got a beard, glasses, a more cynical face.}

<D>__{a hot night in miami january '69 every space in the auditorium is consumed... unfortunately the doors have long since sold out. they've become an act. morrison "falls" off the stage at least every other performance. "the soft parade" album only confirms the plasticity of their approach. songs like "touch me" and "follow me down" are not the doors we once knew. so the question is: why am i here? are funerals entertainment?}
