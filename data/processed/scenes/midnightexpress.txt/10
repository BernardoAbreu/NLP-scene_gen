<A>__{the 707 pan american plane, destination new york, roars up into the sky. pull back all the way to billy sitting next to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near vomiting. he glimpses the plane but it is anti climatic now; as he stares down at his boots. then remembers something! surprised. another angle room. the turkish officers talk ad lib among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, pointing to the hashish plaques, etc. in center background, we see billy submissively lifting his arm for permission to speak, third officer nods, approaches, followed by others. billy slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his boots, bangs it on the heel and two more plaques clatter to the floor. turkish mouths drop open. billy finishes the process with the other boot. an awkward silence off.}
