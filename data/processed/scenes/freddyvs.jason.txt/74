<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{interior abandoned boiler room continuous action}
<A>__{meagan wakes up suddenly. she looks up at stormie, erwin, and jesse standing over her.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{they help meagan to her feet.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(shaky)}
<D>__{he got away... i had him and he got away. oh, god... lizzy... i lost her...}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{well, atleast you're not dead.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no... i'm not dead...}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{no... i'm not. but freddy killed me!}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{he killed me, too. but look...}
<A>__{stormie raises her shirt up to show meagan she is unharmed. erwin sneaks a look and stormie smacks him. meagan gets to her feet, asking:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{now that i think about it he's killed me in all my nightmares. but i'm not dead... what does it mean?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{it means we've still got some time left. until his remains are host to the dream demons freddy can't hurt us.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{hello. the dream demons...?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{freddy made a pact with satan when he died... so satan bestowed upon him the dream demons. they're the source of freddy's power to manipulate our physical reality. without them... he's powerless nothing more than a bad dream.}
<P>__{(off jesse's cynical look)}
<D>__{hey, like i said... i don't make the rules.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{but we've still got a chance, right? a chance to kill freddy before he gets back his power?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{we already tried that. there's no way for us to kill freddy. he's too clever. he knows how to get to us.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{then let's get somebody else. some body strong.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{yeah! we could hire somebody to kill freddy like a hit man!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{you would have to hire a thousand of them... or one really big guy who isn't afraid of anything. no fear. nada. then you got a shot.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{where are you going to find a hit man? the yellow pages? in your dreams...}
<A>__{jesse's last three words strike meagan like a thunder bolt and she stammers out a name:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{jason...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{jason?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{jason voorhees...}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(brightens)}
<D>__{jason voorhees... that's brilliant! the perfect dream warrior... no fear.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{sounds like our man!}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{uh... excuse me, einstein... but isn't jason voorhees dead?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{seriously dead. buried up by crystal lake somewhere. but don't worry, i know how to bring him back to life.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{somehow i just knew you would.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{but that's not the problem. the problem is control. once we bring jason back from the dead... i'm not one hundred percent sure he'll do what we tell him.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{well, that's okay... as long as he doesn't chop us all up.}
<A>__{erwin rolls his eyes around uncertain.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{erwin... i'm trusting you on this, so tell me the truth. do you think if we do this if we go and get jason and bring him back to life, that he could kill freddy?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{no doubt about. jason could wreck freddy on this side of the dreamline. but if freddy has home court advan tage... i don't know. too close to call. the trick would be to get jason to enter a dream state, grab freddy, and drag him out to our reality.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i haven't got a choice. i've got to try something...}
<P>__{(turns to stormie & jesse)}
<D>__{i can't ask either of you to help me do this... it's illegal, immoral, disgusting...}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{hey, we sisters have to stand together, right? where you lead i will follow. count me in.}
<A>__{meagan embraces stormie, then all three turn to jesse. he looks them over and sighs:}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{let me get this straight... we're going to go dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{that's about the size of it... and i'd be doing you a disservice if i said there weren't a modicum of risk involved.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{meagan... i don't want to do this...}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{you don't have to, jesse... it's not your fight. i understand.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{but i damn sure don't want you to do it without me. count me in.}
<A>__{meagan hugs jesse. erwin tries to hug stormie but she pushes him away.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{look out freddy... here we come.}
