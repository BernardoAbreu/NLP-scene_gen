<D>__{thirty thirty at close range.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{will he make it?}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{d.o.a. blew the bastard wide open. had a hole in back you could put your head into. pretty big hole in front too. you could've put your fist into that one.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you see it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nope. heard it. we wasn't far apart. i spotted this buck, then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone. i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. called it right in.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{this is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. twombley's son in law and daughter are up the weekend. didn't you say you'd seen him, wade?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i seen 'em. near ran me over.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you wanna tell 'em, gordon? you knew the old man.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{what the fuck. my day's already ruined.}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{give me the keys. you can go back with jack. you still got a shitload of plowing to do.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{it ain't done, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{something bugging you?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{yeah. a few things.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{well, right now we're not too interested. finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.}
<A>__{brown walks off with shepherd.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{might as well take the rest of the day off. you look sort of fucked up. you've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not exactly. i mean, he never paid me.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{you'll get your money. don't talk to any newspapers about this. twombley's a big deal down in massachusetts, you know. tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lawyer? i don't need no lawyer, do i?}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{no, of course not. just say it, that's all.}
<A>__{wade watches lariviere get into his pickup, drive off.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{where'd twombley get shot?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in the chest.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(offers cigarette)}
<D>__{no, i mean whereabouts.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{a half mile in, along the old lumber road.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you bring him up yourself? that's a steep climb.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the ambulance guys lugged him up.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you stayed away?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{where'd you get the blood?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what blood?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{on your sleeve.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{musta... how'd i know? what're you doing, playing cop?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i gotta make a report to fish and game. i was just wondering, that's all. what'd he do, to shoot himself, i mean?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who the fuck knows? musta slipped or something. i just heard the gun go off.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i never seen a man shot before. not even in the service. must be something.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i didn't actually see him do it. like i said.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{sure you did.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{saw him do it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the fuck you telling me, wade? i never seen the guy get shot, i told you that.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you musta seen him get shot. i know you did.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's get the fuck outta here. you're not making any sense, man.}
<A>__{they walk over to jack's burgundy pickup. wade eyes the rifles in the gun rack.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{there's your old twenty gauge, and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work.}
<P>__{(touches it)}
<D>__{but what the hell, jack, i guess you deserve it. right's right.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(starts engine)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he sure as hell won't.}
