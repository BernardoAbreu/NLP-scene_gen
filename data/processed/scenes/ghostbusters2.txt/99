<L>__{interior museum restoration studio day (moments later)}
<A>__{janosz is working on the vigo painting when the ghostbusters enter. he rushes over and stops them at the door.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{dr. venkman? dana is not here.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{then why have you come?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{we got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. your name was first.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(to spengler and winston)}
<D>__{let's sweep it, boys.}
<A>__{they deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to janosz)}
<D>__{you know, i never got to ask you. where you from, johnny?}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{the upper west side.}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(consulting his pke meter)}
<D>__{this entire room is extremely hot, peter.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{what exactly are you looking for, dr. venkman?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{we'll know when we find it. you just sit tight. this won't take long.}
<B>__{stantz}
<A>__{using the giga meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. venkman comes up behind him with janosz right on his heels.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{this is the one that looked at dana.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{it must be the chemical fumes in the studio. people start imagining things }
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{i'm going to rule out the glue sniffing theory. if she says it looked at her, it looked at her.}
<P>__{(to vigo)}
<D>__{hey, you! vigie! look at me. i'm talking to you. hey! look at me when i'm talking to you.}
<A>__{they watch the painting for any sign of movement.}
<B>__{vigo}
<A>__{his eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.}
<B>__{stantz and venkman}
<A>__{venkman starts shooting polaroids of vigo.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to vigo)}
<D>__{beautiful, beautiful. work with me, baby. just have fun with it.}
<P>__{(to stantz)}
<D>__{okay, he's playing it cool. let's finish up and get out of here.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{i will get one more reading.}
<A>__{venkman walks off leaving stantz alone with the painting. stantz scans the painting with the giga meter until his eyes meet vigo's.}
<B>__{vigo}
<A>__{his eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of stantz's soul.}
<B>__{stantz}
<A>__{he stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him. winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell.}
<C>__{winston}
<P>__{(looking at the painting)}
<D>__{now that's one ugly dude.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(coming back to his senses)}
<D>__{huh? what?}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{you finished here?}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{what? yeah.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{are you all right? you coming down with something?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{no, i'm fine. i just got light headed for a second there. let's go.}
<A>__{they head for the door.}
<B>__{janosz}
<A>__{he escorts the ghostbusters to the door.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{so you see, everything is in order, is it not?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{not. don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. we'll be back.}
<A>__{they exit.}
