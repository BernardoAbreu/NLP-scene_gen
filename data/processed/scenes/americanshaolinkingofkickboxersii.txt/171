<A>__{who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique, and then immediately plays to the crowd, right in front of drew and}
<B>__{the others.}
<A>__{the referee comes over to trevor, and raises his fist up in victory. trevor tears his arm away and screams to the crowd:}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{i'm not done!}

<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{i want him!}
<A>__{he points right at drew.}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i came to the shaolin temple because of you, trevor. you humiliated me, and i wanted to make sure it could never happen again.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{so, let's see what you've learned.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i've learned that... there's nothing to prove. beating you is no longer important. it was my ego that had to be defeated, not you.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{bull! you're just chicken!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{the arts should never be about who is best they are too important for that.}

<D>__{how about you, baldy? or you?}
<A>__{he is pointing at li and gao and the others, who are itching to climb into the ring. gao goes over to san de, and shoots a questioning look at drew.}
<C>__{gao}

<C>__{san de}
<P>__{(looking at drew)}
<D>__{what should be done?}
<C>__{gao }
<D>__{someone should face him in combat. for the tradition of the temple.}

<C>__{san de}
<D>__{there are some times when a shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.}

<A>__{who understands the implication of what he is saying. he starts to smile slowly.}
<C>__{san de }
<D>__{it's your call.}
<A>__{drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where trevor is still standing, trying to get someone to fight him. drew walks with gao back to the side of the ring. he turns to gao and li and together they high five.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{for the temple...}
<A>__{drew climbs into the ring. the crowd is going crazy. trevor has a predator's grin on his face as he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match. immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him massage, drinks, etc.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who sits alone in the other corner.}
<B>__{angle on li and gao}
<A>__{who see the difference. immediately, they mobilize the other monks.}
<B>__{angle on gao}
<A>__{who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to give it to drew. angle on drew's corner as it is flooded with monks. some of them are massaging drew (painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels to bring air to him, etc. the referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. they do, and he motions for them to bow to each other.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{remember last time, punk?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{nothing exists but the moment, and...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... i'm going to enjoy it.}
<A>__{they back up, and the fight begins. trevor attacks hard, but drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu. he continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy technique, but he can't touch drew.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{stay still, dammit! stand and fight!}
<A>__{and he dances out of the way. trevor is getting more and more angry. soon, drew tires of this game and decides to end this quickly. he goes after trevor, and it is immediately obvious that trevor is completely outclassed. drew scores on trevor at will, and soon has trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of high kicks, takedowns, flips and punches. trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even bothering to defend himself. drew grabs trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist. he is going to put him out with a good old fashioned roundhouse punch.}

<A>__{yelling for the knock out blow.}
<B>__{angle on d.s. and san de}
<A>__{worried about this latest development. instead, however, drew smiles and lifts trevor up and shakes his hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd. trevor looks into drew's face, wondering why drew would do such a thing. when he sees drew's friendly face, he knows. to teach him a lesson. trevor smiles and holds up drew's hand as the champion. the crowd goes crazy.}
