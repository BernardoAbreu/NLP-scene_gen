<L>__{interior construct}
<A>__{neo is standing in an empty, blank white space.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this is the construct.}
<A>__{startled, neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the room with him.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it is our loading program. we can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. anything we need.}
<A>__{morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a large screen television.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{right now, we're inside a computer program?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{wild, isn't it?}
<A>__{neo's hands run over the cracked leather.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{this isn't real?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{what is real? how do you define real? if you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.}
<A>__{he picks up a remote control and clicks on the television. we drift through the windy city circa 1996.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this is the chicago you know. chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century. this chicago exists only as part of a neural interactive simulation that we call the matrix.}
<A>__{we glide at the television as he changes the channel.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you have been living inside baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory. this is chicago as it exists today.}
<A>__{the sky is an endless sea of black and green bile. the earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out beneath us as we enter the television.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{'the desert of the real.'}
<A>__{in the distance, we see the ruins of a future chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long dead corpse.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we are, right now, miles below the earth's surface. the only place humans can survive outside the matrix is underground.}
<A>__{still moving, we turn and find neo and morpheus; the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. dizzy, neo holds onto the chair.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it started early in the twenty first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.}
<A>__{in his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{at first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. whatever they were given, it was not enough.}
<A>__{in the circular window of the glasses, explosions light up a bloody battle field.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we don't know who struck first. us or them. but sometime at the end of the twenty first century the battle was joined.}
<A>__{we move into his glasses and the war surrounds us.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red.}
<A>__{at last we see the sentinels; killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful. they have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is perpetually in motion. the sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it scorched and burned the sky. without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive.}
<A>__{the sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud of stain.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{they discovered a new form of fusion. all that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge. throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.}
<A>__{we return to the power plant that neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the human body generates more bio electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25,000 b.t.u.'s of body heat.}
<A>__{outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.}
<A>__{huge farm like reapers are harvesting the crop.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{all they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.}
<A>__{we see inside a clear tubular husk. floating in viscous fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already growing around the brain jack.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{and so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.}
<A>__{we pull back to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the construct.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{no! i don't believe it! it's not possible!}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i didn't say that it would be easy, neo. i just said that it would be the truth.}
<A>__{the room without walls begins to spin.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{stop! let me out! i want out!}
