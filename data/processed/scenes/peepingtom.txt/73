<D>__{be patient, viv... it's going to be worth it.}
<A>__{close shot of the studio camera. in front of it fixed on a small hook is a tape measure. mark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance between the trunk and the camera... then he takes apiece of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the floor. the music continues.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{help yourself.}
