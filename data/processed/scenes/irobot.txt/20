<L>__{interior metal hallway day}
<A>__{spooner and calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in before. catch sight of a couple robot technicians...}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{ah, christ...toasters...}
<A>__{as they duck under the police tape and...}
<L>__{interior hogenmiller's lab day}
<A>__{...enter hogenmiller's lab. alive with activity. crime scene technicians, mobile analysis units. light scans, running across... hogenmiller's lifeless face. black gun powder. fanning out around his contorted lips. spooner. throws a look around the lab: robots. everywhere. mostly incomplete. torsos. arms. legs. dangling from the ceiling. a sergeant. passes them by...}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{they say the price's gonna come down a lot next year. kinda cool, huh?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{how cool will it be when one takes your job?}
<A>__{spooner. pushing past him. his eyes. darting around.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{is everything alright, detective?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{yeah. this is just how i like my robots in pieces.}
<A>__{as they approach hogenmiller's body, the lead crime scene investigator, baldez, gets up to meet them.}
<C>__{baldez}
<P>__{(to spooner)}
<D>__{can you believe it, man? u.s. robotics. i didn't think i'd ever see the inside of this building.}
<A>__{hands spooner, a plasma clipboard. spooner signs it, awkwardly. with his left hand...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what's the run down?}
<C>__{baldez}
<D>__{heinrich hogenmiller, sixty four years old. weapon a small caliber .22, registered in his name. looks like he walked in, locked the door, and snuffed himself.}
<A>__{spooner. cocking his head to look at hogenmiller's face.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i know someone who disagrees with you.}
<C>__{baldez}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{spooner. stands. pointing down at hogenmiller.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{him.}
<A>__{and steps over the body, leaving a confused baldez. stepping deeper, into the lab. calvin. following.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i spoke to a dead man today. want to tell me about that?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments. attended staff meetings. he hated corporate life. the hologram enabled him to focus on his work. it's just a device, detective.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{a device that called the police.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{the sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{but the call came directly to me.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{we're talking about a mechanism designed by hogenmiller to say provocative things. to irritate and confound his colleagues.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and that's what you think it is?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head.}
<A>__{they pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. spooner curls his lip. swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{when's the last time any of you actually spoke to hogenmiller? i mean human to human?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i couldn't say.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{take a guess.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't guess, detective. but if pressed, i would reason it had been a considerable length of time.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{how well did you know him?}
<A>__{calvin. gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{not well. but i admired his work tremendously.}
<A>__{spooner. studies her for a beat. then turns back to the body. two coroners entering with a high tech body box.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i get the whole "mad scientist" thing. hogenmiller was past his prime. isolated. eccentric. he enters a room. locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain. everything about this case says suicide.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you don't sound convinced.}
<A>__{the coroners. start loading the body into the box.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly.}
<P>__{(turning to her)}
<C>__{spooner }
<D>__{what all this is missing is personality...}
<A>__{as he starts for the door...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you have 24 hour surveillance?...}
