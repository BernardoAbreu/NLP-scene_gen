<L>__{interior robert's room moments later}
<A>__{ted is led into robert's room. it's a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about. a wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{huh. wig horse.}
<A>__{robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. donny stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{now, remember, ted, you belong to robert now. so you will do as he says.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid.}
<C>__{donny}
<P>__{(leaning in to ted with anger)}
<D>__{language!!!}
<A>__{ted flinches nervously. donny moves back.}
<C>__{donny }
<D>__{when i was a little boy, i saw you on television. and i thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing i'd ever seen. ever. and i asked my father if i could have a magical teddy bear, too. and he said no. and i was heartbroken. i decided that if i ever had a son, i would never say no to him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{maybe "no" to a snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{me and ted are gonna be best friends, daddy.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{yes. you are. happy play time.}
<A>__{donny shuts the door. robert stares at ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{no! daddy said no bad words!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah well, fuck your dad.}
<A>__{ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. it doesn't budge. he takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{robert stands over him.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's a great story, i felt like i was there.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{daddy gave me an ouch. now i have to give you an ouch.}
<A>__{robert grabs ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of ted's ears with the other hand. robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. ted screams as loud as he can. robert looks at him, holding the ear.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay... okay, kid. you win. we'll do it your way. you wanna play a game or somethin'? it's play time, let's play a game.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yeah, i wanna play a game!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i love hide and seek! i will hide!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, now, robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, a well mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think?}
<A>__{there's a beat. robert stares blankly at him, then:}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{okay, you hide first.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{great. fantastic. okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{do i need to wash my hands before this game?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you... well no, you god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'.}
<A>__{robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{one... two... three...}
<A>__{ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid cancer.}
<A>__{ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns the doorknob. he opens the door, and exits out into the hallway. after a beat, he re enters, grabs his severed ear, and exits again.}
