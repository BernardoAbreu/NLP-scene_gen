<L>__{exterior rope bridge day}
<A>__{the tengu are on full alert. one of them hears something, snaps around, there's nothing there. another tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg. he screeches and stomps down his taloned foot, missing the creature by inches. we hear a caw and the queen tengu squints as she spots a falcon circling in the sky above. the queen is perched on top of a 20 foot rock face. she looks around hesitantly. now the rangers attack, some of them lunging off rocks, others bursting out of crevices, others coming over the walls. billy wields his whistling sticks misses several times, then starts bashing and thwacking the feathered beasts. the queen shoots a laser blast from her eyes it explodes before tommy. kimberly battles another tengu and the creature forces her back on to the rickety bridge. the queen fires another blast.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{rocky dives, knocking aisha away from the bolt. adam and one of the tengu circle each other warily.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out...}
<A>__{suddenly the tengu is hurtled backward ten feet through the air. we didn't even see adam move.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{... in the blink of an eye.}
<A>__{tommy steps up behind a tengu.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yo, tweety!}
<A>__{the tengu turns around and tommy whallops him with a spinning heel kick. a tengu faces down aisha and she goes into a bear stance.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{the bear is sturdy as a towering tree. nothing can uproot it.}
<A>__{the tengu charges like a bull, slams into aisha. she holds fast and the bird explodes into a cloud of feathers.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{bye, bye birdy.}
<A>__{kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she exchanges blows with her foe. she finally drops into a crane stance... then just like dulcea she leaps through the air, executes a brutal spinning hell kick and sends the birdman tumbling off the bridge. in a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{hasta la pasta, bigbird!}
<A>__{billy swings his sticks, bashes one of the tengu in the beak the creature explodes into a cloud of feathers!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{aim for their beaks!}
<A>__{tommy reaches the top of a rack. he sees a tengu making a kamikaze dive toward kimberly. tommy dives, soaring thirty feet through the air he intercepts the tengu and they spin toward earth together. they hit the ground and exchange blows}
<B>__{as they fall over one another.}
<A>__{rocky slams another tengu in the beak, kablam the creature is obliterated. tommy leaps into the air, nails two tengu in the beaks. they}
<B>__{both burst in an explosion of feathers.}
<A>__{the queen shoots another bolt of energy a rock explodes, showering the kids with shrapnel. aisha turns to rocky.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{it's up to you.}
<A>__{rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position. incredibly he scales the wall in the same way he went up the pole. he flips over the top and lands right before the queen tengu. he looks her dead in the eye.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{polly wanna cracker?}
<A>__{with that, he executes a devastating spinning heel kick and the queen bursts into oblivion.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{all right, rocky!}
<A>__{instantly, the remaining tengu retreat, squawking and cawwing in rage. the kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we did it!!}
