<B>__{an hour later}
<A>__{ryan is stuck with jim, talking real estate. alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's sixty acres up against the foothills. i subdivided the old lazy w ranch and took a nice slice for myself.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sounds nice.}
<A>__{jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass".}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{homes will go in the high fours.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{must be a nice development.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{it's a community, not a development. the concept is turn key everything. you buy a maintenance contract with the home. we'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. furniture? you buy your own or choose a package. seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{ryan and alex make eye contact. there's a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we all need a place to call our own. this is america. this is what we were promised.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{that's a nice touch.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{that bit at the end about promise... i like it.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(leading)}
<D>__{so, you still renting that one bedroom?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i gave it up.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you own now?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but you're looking?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{not really. no.}
<A>__{the conversation stalls out.}
