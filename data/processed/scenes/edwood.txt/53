<L>__{interior larchmont studios day}
<A>__{the company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage. there are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls. they prep bela's set: a fishnet draped armchair in front of a flat. ed is perched high in his director's chair, back in men's clothes.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the set doesn't look right! it looks too... empty. clutter it up. put a skeleton in the corner. and what's that thing over there?}
<C>__{paul marco}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well it looks good. let's use it!}
<A>__{georgie hurriedly strides over. he holds the script.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{ed! what's with these revised pages?! a scene in a smelting factory? a buffalo stampede?? three hundred soldiers storming anzio beach ??! what's going on here? i can't afford to film this nonsense!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{don't worry. we're not gonna film any of it. georgie then how's it gonna get in the picture ?!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i know a guy in universal's stock house he's giving me the footage for free. this movie's gonna look like a million bucks.}
<A>__{georgie nods. oh, okay.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{mr. lugosi has arrived!}
<A>__{ed jumps excitedly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<P>__{(he yells)}
<D>__{mr. lugosi is here! now everyone, when he walks on the stage}
<P>__{(nobody is listening; so ed uses his megaphone)}
<D>__{now everyone, when he walks on the stage, treat him normal. i know bela lugosi is a world famous star, and you're all a little excited, but we're professionals. so if you treat him with respect, everything will be alright.}
<B>__{at the stage door}
<A>__{the door swings open, and bela strides in, looking dapper. he glances at the teensy stage, and his face falls imperceptibly. ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{bela! it's so great to see you!}
<P>__{(he glances at his watch)}
<D>__{and eight o'clock on the dot. right on time!}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i am always on time.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{of course! well, we got a big day planned for you... first, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there. then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment }
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(he leans in and whispers)}
<D>__{uh, eddie, do you have my money?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh?! oh yeah, of course.}
<A>__{ed and bela step over to a corner.}
<B>__{across the room}
<A>__{from a distance, ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and peels off a few bills for bela. the crew watches, fascinated.}
