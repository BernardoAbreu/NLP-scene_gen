<A>__{tears stream down salvatore's cheeks. he gives her a look of longing, of desire. elena embraces him. they kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so many years ago. and they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, like two teenagers. passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. their hair damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. then the frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense grief...as outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which seems suspended in empty space.)}

<A>__{salvatore is sitting by the table. he has finished the cup of coffee signora anna has prepared for him. he picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's the one alfredo had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put the reels on the projector.}

<D>__{when they showed your films on television, he was happy. he'd plop himself down there and all his ailments were forgotten. he knew all the words by heart, every one, and i'd describe what was going on. and when the papers talked about you, i had to read them two or three times...}
<A>__{salvatore examines the can, wonders what it can be. he opens it: inside is a reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. those objects bring a pang to his heart, and the things that anna said, but he feels disappointed, as if he expected to find something else.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{did he ever think of meeting me?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, never! one time your mother said that if he wanted, you'd have surely come. he got furious and said 'no, toto mustn't come back to giancaldo, never!!' he didn't say it to be mean. he was a decent man. who knows what he could have been thinking? towards the end he'd say such strange things. and a moment before he shut his eyes, he told your mother not to let you know.}
