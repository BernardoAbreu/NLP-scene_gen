<L>__{interior other house hallway continuous}
<A>__{she pulls coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the end. coraline flails at the tall other mother with her fists.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{ow, that hurts!}
<A>__{tall other mother shoves coraline right through the mirror as if it was water!}
<L>__{interior closet prison behind the mirror continuous}
<A>__{coraline hits the ground hard. the tall other mother, head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her angrily.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{you may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter!}
<A>__{she pulls her head out and leaves coraline in darkness. coraline pounds on the mirror door, kicks it with her blue boots. a sob wells up in her throat. and then we hear a soft ghostly moan. she turns. she can just make out a sagging iron bed. when the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its stained cover.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{tall girl ghost }
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{hush! and shush! for the beldam might be listening!}
<A>__{coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under the covers in sync with the words she hears.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you ... you mean the other mother? ...}
<A>__{she gently pulls back the sheets. the dimly glowing ghosts of three children, button eyes, sit up: a sweet girl ghost, coraline's size; a tall girl ghost, emotional; a young boy ghost, very sad.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<P>__{(wistful)}
<D>__{don't remember our names... but i `member my true mommy...}
<A>__{the boy, dressed like huck finn, conjures up ghost flowers. the strange looking flowers wither and fade. he's so sad that coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{why are you all here?}
<C>__{all ghosts}
<D>__{the beldam!}
<A>__{the ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly fish in water.}
<C>__{sweet girl ghost}
<D>__{she spied on our lives, through the little doll's eyes,}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<D>__{and saw that we weren't happy.}
<C>__{tall girl ghost}
<D>__{so she lured us away,}
<C>__{tall girl ghost }
<D>__{with treasures and treats,}
<C>__{sweet girl ghost}
<D>__{and games to play!}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<D>__{gave all that we asked }
<C>__{sweet girl ghost}
<D>__{yet we still wanted more }
<C>__{tall girl ghost}
<D>__{so we let her sew the buttons.}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<D>__{she said that she loved us,}
<C>__{tall girl ghost}
<D>__{but she locked us here}
<C>__{all ghosts}
<D>__{and ate up our lives.}
<A>__{the ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down. coraline is stunned. she thinks a little and then speaks, trying to steady her voice.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. beating her is my only chance.}
<A>__{a beat. then the sweet girl asks in her sing song way:}
<C>__{sweet girl ghost}
<D>__{perhaps, if you do win your escape, you could find our eyes?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{has she taken those, too?}
<C>__{sweet girl ghost}
<D>__{yes, miss. and hidden them.}
<C>__{boy ghost}
<D>__{find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i ... i will try.}
<A>__{the ghosts pulse with hope. coraline sits down against the mirror door, bounces her head against it. she's not hopeless. suddenly, hands reach through the mirror and pull her out!}
