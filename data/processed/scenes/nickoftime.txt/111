<L>__{interior room 2510 day 1:21pm}
<A>__{the clock on the nightstand.}
<L>__{1:21.}
<A>__{eleanor grant sits against the headboard. gene sits on the edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in his hand.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't believe me.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{i said i'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. you're telling me my people are in a plot against me. you're telling me my husband wants me killed. what do you expect?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i don't blame you. i don't have any proof. but nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. you can't be totally oblivious. you must suspect something. you're doing things which are making people angry. people who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. you know them better than me. how much does it mean to them? how far would they go to hang onto it?}
<A>__{her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. gene sees it, hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{there's only one way to find out for sure. try to cancel the last speech.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<P>__{(smiling, covering her inner thought)}
<D>__{i'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{it's the last chance they have for me to kill you. try to get out of it. they won't let you. they can't. try to change the schedule and you'll know i'm right. what have you got to lose? it comes down to who you trust, them or me? test them.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{i love it when pistolero's talk of trust.}
<A>__{gene, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. he takes the plunge.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{this? i've never even fired one.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{indeed.}
<A>__{eleanor grant's hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging the room into blackness.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<P>__{(in the blackness)}
<D>__{franco! franco.'}
<A>__{gene slips out into the hall as the connecting room door flies open. light from the other room spills in. franco rushes in, pulling a gun.}
