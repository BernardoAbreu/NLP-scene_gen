<A>__{yoko enters the room, which is also a mess. the moving boxes are tumbled about the small room. she sighs. then she notices the ceramic cat on the shelf, facing her (where susan left it). apparently she's not a big fan of felines: she uneasily turns it to face the wall instead. yoko turns back to the room, staring to stack the moving boxes (the way we saw them before). as she does she pauses again. the music in her headphones starts phasing, digital noise creeping in... yoko takes off the headphones. stares at them. and then there's another croaking sound. from close by. yoko draws a breath, quickly looking up at the ceiling, directly above her. that's where the horrible sound is coming from. freaked out, yoko backs away, and opens the bedroom door }
