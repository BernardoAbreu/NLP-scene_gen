<L>__{exterior desert road morning}
<A>__{two old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the flat surface of the desert. further out into the desert, the one in the lead, sallah's truck, stops and the second one, omar's truck, pulls up beside it. there are half dozen arab diggers in omar's truck. indy, dressed as an arab, gets out of the cab of sallah's truck and moves over to confer with omar, another old friend. they point off into the desert and reach some conclusion. indy gives him a pat on the back; omar turns off the road and drives into the desert with his workers. indy hops back in the cab of sallah's truck with sallah. as they move down the road we see that the back of the truck holds three other arab diggers.}
