<L>__{interior town center night}
<A>__{the ant army has gathered in a huge hall in front of a reviewing stand. we can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers but all we can see is a huge poster of an ant general pointing right at the camera. the poster reads, "general formica wants you to obey". z turns to some of the soldiers near him.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{any of you guys know when the princess will show up? she's kind of a personal friend.}
<A>__{the soldiers look at z like he's nuts.}
<C>__{loud voice}
<D>__{atten shun!}
<A>__{martial music sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention. z imitates the soldiers awkwardly. general formica struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect)}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{first of all, let me make one thing clear. nobody ever won a battle bythinking for himself. all this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap. if the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn'ttrapped inside your head.}
<A>__{in the audience, z starts laughing he thinks formica's just made a joke.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(slapping his thigh)}
<D>__{"trapped inside your head" that's a good one }
<A>__{z notices nobody else is laughing. he stops.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{geez tough room.}
<A>__{from the stage, formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants. he continues.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(striding back and forth)}
<D>__{we ants survive as a species because we do what we're told. we survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere!}
<P>__{(dramatic pause)}
<D>__{hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, withgiant fists, and giant jaws!}
<A>__{the soldiers cheer! z cheers along with the rest of them.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(to the soldier ant next to him)}
<D>__{lays it on a little thick, doesn't he? if you ask me, he's one giant bore.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{now i've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage. well you boys are gonna be taken care of. but in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{geez, and i forgot my toothbrush.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(reflective moment)}
<D>__{dammit, i'm proud to be an ant.}
<P>__{(he looks out at his army)}
<D>__{and i know each and every one of you boys will do your duty. dismissed.}
<A>__{z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(clapping)}
<D>__{bravo! bring on the princess!}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{stow the gab there, soldier! let's move 'em out!}
<A>__{the soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand. a colonel marches at the head of z's column as z looks around for the princess.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{eyes...left!}
<A>__{finally, as z's part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next to the queen, who is giving the royal wave.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(waving)}
<D>__{princess! princess bala! hey! it's me! z! i've got your scarf!}
<A>__{on the reviewing stand, bala sees z that is to say, she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by...}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(peering out)}
<D>__{who is that idiot?}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{darling, you must encourage the troops wave!}
<A>__{bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist. down below, z takes this as a sign that bala has seen him.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{excuse me, guys that's my date. well, it's been fun. have a great war!}
<A>__{z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers and they're carrying him along with them.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{hey! wait!}
<A>__{z loses sight of the princess as he's carried away. barbatus, a hard as nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps z on the shoulder.}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{you new, kid?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i just joined up. but i'm quitting! i got a trial membership!}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{trial membership? kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.}
<A>__{at that moment, z is swept out of the cramped corridor they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the open air outside of the colony.}
