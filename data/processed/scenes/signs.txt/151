<A>__{merrill waits for his brother to say something. beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{it went on all night. everywhere. it was completely a ground battle. mostly hand to hand. you can't see them unless you're up close. a lot of people died. some from combat. but most from poison gas inhalation. they secrete it.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{how many died?}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{they think over a hundred thousand. they're just estimates.}

<P>__{(voice cracks)}
<D>__{ who is everything i want to be, starts losing faith in things. i saw your eyes last night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? i'm serious.}
<A>__{merrill's face is hard. he looks shaken. graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{beat. there's a wheezing sound from the corner of the room. graham and merrill turn to look at morgan laying down on merrill's folded sweater. morgan's breathing is strained. he still looks grey.}

<B>__{a slight static is heard. graham turns the volume all the}
