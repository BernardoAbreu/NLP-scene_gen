<L>__{interior cargo ship. day}
<A>__{the cage is lowered by a crane. jenny looks out from her swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses.}
<L>__{interior cage. london zoo. day}
<A>__{now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent enclosure. she has been dressed, ridiculously and poignantly in a smock and a bonnet. a group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of her. eventually they give up and move on.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{in london she had many admirers of whom your father was but one.}
<A>__{darwin moves forwards from the shadows, where he has been observing and taking notes. as the other humans move away be attempts to start a conversation with jenny in her own language, much in the way he communicated with baby annie.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{hoo hoo hoo hoo.}
<A>__{jenny regards him sceptically then looks away.}
<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{hoo!!}
<A>__{she startles and looks at him aggressively.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{hm?}
<A>__{he reaches in his pocket. this gets her interest. she comes closer, expecting food. darwin takers out a sprig of verbena a strongly scented herb. he holds in front of his nose and inhales, making contented expressions of pleasure. jenny watches. darwin holds the verbena towards jenny. cautiously she extends a hand through the bars. their fingers touch in space, like god giving life to adam. for darwin its a breakthrough a moment of connection. jenny eats the verbena and spits it out, shrieking angrily.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{wait, sorry, wait i've got something else here for you}
<A>__{he reaches in his pocket. she cocks her head, alert. with the air of a conjurer, he pulls out: a child's hand mirror, flashing as it catches the sun through the skylights.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(pleasurable surprise)}
<D>__{ahhhh!!}
<A>__{he shows jenny her own reflection and, then hands the mirror through the bars. jenny takes the mirror, bites it, discovers it is inedible, and smashes it on the ground. charles makes a sad, whining sound}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{hew hew hew...}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(pouting)}
<D>__{hmph.}
<A>__{meaning: "ok then, i'm sorry." it's such a complex human reaction grudging contrition that charles laughs aloud with pleasure. jenny laughs. charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of chopin. jenny covers her ears and chatters. "not listening not listening!" charles, insulted, stops playing. jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say: "play, if it amuses you. i'm must kidding."}
