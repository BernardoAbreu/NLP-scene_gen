<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.}
<A>__{john doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{sometimes you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer... and then you get their strict attention.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what are you looking at, johnny?}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{looking back... at the city proper...}
