<L>__{interior martha's office day}
<D>__{mother miriam addresses the secretary, helen.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{is the doctor in her office?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{ah, who shall i say is calling?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{general macarthur. she heads onto martha's office. helen jumps up after her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{just a minute please, you can't go in there. mother miriam pushes the door open to reveal martha.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{it's... it's alright helen, just close the door. mother miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto}
<A>__{martha's desk.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i've just met with the bishop. we're taking you off the case.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(picking up the papers)}
<D>__{you're what?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.}
<P>__{(starts to leave)}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{one that will ask the questions you want asked.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(halting)}
<A>__{one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{for the church?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{for agnes.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{you think she's a saint?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{she's been touched by god, yes.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{how? how? she hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. give me a miracle.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{the father!}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{who is he?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{why must he be anybody?}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(laughs and sits down)}
<A>__{my god, you're as crazy as...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{stop laughing, i don't say it's the truth, i'm saying...}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{how (distorted) ?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{don't be ridiculous.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{well give me a reasonable explanation}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{a miracle is an event without an explanation. if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{this is insane.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{you're saying god did it?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{no, that's as much as saying father martineau did it. i'm saying god permitted it.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{but how did it happen?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{you'll never find the answer for everything god did.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{i thought you didn't believe in miracles today mother?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{but i want the opportunity to believe. i want the choice to believe.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{she is an innocent.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{but she is not an enigma mother. everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. one, two, three, right down the line.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{that's what you believe she is? the sum of her psychological parts?}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{that's what i have to believe...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<A>__{then why are you so obsessed with her? you're losing sleep over her?}
<P>__{(martha gets up disturbed)}
<A>__{you're thinking about her all the time. you're bent on saving her. why?}
<D>__{martha has no answer.}
<C>__{mother miriam }
<P>__{(calmer)}
<D>__{i'm not accusing. i'm recognizing.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{there's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. did you know about that? there's an answer mother. that's how she got out.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{that's crazy. how could she find out about it?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{somebody told her.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{who? that tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{oh, would you stop lying mother!}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{why would i lie?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{because it's murder we're talking about. aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i'm concerned about her health.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{who was that person mother? was it you?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{if you believe this is murder, it is the crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. and definitely not agnes. she goes out and slams the door.}
