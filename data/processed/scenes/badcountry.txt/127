<L>__{interior jesse's house late night}
<A>__{jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch... there's a sound outside...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{jesse moves soundlessly through the house, gun ready, toward the back door. jesse's pov: as the door opens slow, he we see on the porch:}
<B>__{lucian}
<A>__{seated comfortably in a chair...}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{couldn't sleep.}
<A>__{jesse looks to the darkness. dogwood trees. thick growth.}
<B>__{eerie silence...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{got somethin' on your mind?}
<C>__{lucian}
<P>__{(without looking at him)}
<D>__{there's been an adjustment to the list, jesse...}
<A>__{jesse's silent. you can cut the tension with a knife:}
<B>__{...}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{we got this...heathen. a whore of an irishman...down in baton rouge. he's protected. got a lot of guys around him. that's why it pays. that's why nobody wants the job... that's why we're here talkin'.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address written on back. jesse flips over the photo: it's bud, in uniform.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{this cop... he's got a mouthpiece... somewhere. ain't yet figured out who. in the meantime, shut him down.}
<A>__{on jesse, a frozen moment. he forces out the words:}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's done.}
<A>__{with that, lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into darkness.}
