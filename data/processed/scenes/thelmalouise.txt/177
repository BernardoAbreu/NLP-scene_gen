<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{whaddo we do?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{oh, i don't know, thelma. i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays. maybe we could have children with the prison guards.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm not suggestin' that! i'm not goin' back. no matter what happens. so don't worry about me.}
<A>__{louise speeds up. thelma hands louise a little bottle of wild turkey and she drinks it down. thelma has one too.}

<C>__{louise}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you mean now or before?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{before.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{what little dogs?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you know those little dogs you see people with?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{like a chihuahua?}

<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh yeah. you mean peek a poos.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{yeah. those. that always put the fear of god in me. what about you?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i mean, look how different he looks just since high school. it's bad enough i have to get old, but doin' it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse.}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{i mean, i don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{well, now, maybe you won't have to.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?}
