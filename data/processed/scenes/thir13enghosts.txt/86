<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{it was penned in the fifteenth century by an astrologer named basileus. in it he describes the building of a certain device. one that can see into the future, as legend has it, it was described to him while under demonic possession.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{needless to say, his book didn't make the best seller's list. after reading it, the church burned him at the stake. his writings, however, survived. (looking around) i just can't believe he built it...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what're you talking about?}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{basileus' device. the eye of hell.}
