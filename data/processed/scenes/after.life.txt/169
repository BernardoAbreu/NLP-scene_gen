<L>__{exterior funeral home moments later}
<A>__{paul treads carefully along the side of the funeral home. it's a full moon. the trees rustle ominously in the wind. casting eerie shadows against the dark house. he finds a window. tries to open it. it won't budge. just then he hears a noise in the bushes. he crouches down quickly. listens hard. nothing.}
<B>__{from the bushes}
<A>__{someone watches paul tentatively move to another window.}
<B>__{funeral home}
<A>__{paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's caught in a circle of bright light. paul turns quickly. a dark figure stands over him. menacing.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing here?}
<A>__{the figure lowers the flashlight. it's tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm taking you home.}
