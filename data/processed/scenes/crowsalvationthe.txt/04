<L>__{interior garrison prison deathrow night}
<A>__{close on a birthday cake, twenty one candles flickering as it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on one hand by mercer, a mustached prison guard.}
<L>__{interior garrison prison alex's cell night}
<A>__{clang. the barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing on a small table next to a chess game in progress and an untouched last meal. adjust to find... alex corvis. twenty one today. disarmingly appealing. peaceful. simple clothes. he looks up from the game, at... peter walsh, alex's pro bono attorney and only friend, trying not to explode at this shit eating stunt.}
<C>__{walsh}
<D>__{he didn't order that.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{we found the man with the scar.}
<A>__{despite himself, alex looks up. mercer gestures at... the cake in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting with a large zigzag marking on the forearm, also frosting. favoring alex looking from the cake up to mercer, who nods at the candles.}
<C>__{mercer }
<D>__{go ahead. make a wish.}
<C>__{walsh}
<P>__{(intense whisper)}
<D>__{get it out of here.}
<A>__{alex focusses on the chess board. tries to anyway.}
