<L>__{exterior engine room night}
<A>__{finnegan and pantucci run to the end of a long section of metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their breath. everything has gone dead quiet, except for the billowing and clanging of the engines. smoke and sparks obscure their vision.}

<D>__{finnegan, what the hell was that?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i don't know...you got what we need?}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{if i don't, i ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?}
<A>__{both of them listen to the silence. and then, at the far end of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. finnegan and pantucci watch, transfixed. then, like a locomotive gathering speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two of them. louderfasterlouderfaster!!!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{come on!!}
<A>__{finnegan and pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls. silence returns. except for the steaming, creaking machinery...and an ominous sucking sound.}
