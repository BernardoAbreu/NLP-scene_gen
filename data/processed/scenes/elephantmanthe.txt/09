<T>__{dissolve to hallway:}
<A>__{mrs. mothershead comes out of the kitchen with a supper tray and walks down the hall, passing the open ward door. we see nurses serving patients their supper. nora comes out of the ward with a tray which she holds tightly against her. a bowl of soup is spilling on her apron. she catches up with mothershead. they speak as they walk.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{oh, mrs. mothershead, please forgive my behavior yesterday. i'm sorry if you're having to do extra work on my account. it was just seeing it...}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{patients here are not "its". they are either "he's" or "she's", but that's alright, ireland. this one's going to be more work for all of us. good god girl! mind your broth.}
<A>__{mothershead continues on. nora guiltily watches her go.}
<B>__{isolation ward}
<A>__{treves and merrick are absorbed in their work. a knock comes at the door.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{mothershead enters.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{why, my dear mrs. mothershead, how good of you to join us. mr. merrick, will you please introduce yourself?}

<D>__{good lord, mr. treves!}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(exuberantly)}
<D>__{we've made tremendous strides today, mothershead. he listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{parrots can do as much, mr. treves. it's all very nice, but i don't see the pointerior you know they won't let him stay here.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{i'm sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. now i'm not expecting miracles. i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. i'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.}
<P>__{(to merrick)}
<D>__{that was very good, john, very good. that's all for today. we shall do some more tomorrow. mothershead?}
<A>__{mrs. mothershead sets the tray down beside merrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will see you soon.}
<A>__{he and mothershead exit. merrick watches the door close. he sighs quietly, looks about, and sees the bible on the bedside table. he picks it up and, gently runs his fingers over the cover. receiving room the london there is total pandemonium in the receiving room. the room is filled with screaming men, women and children. two drunken women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now covered with blood and cuts. the women are still hysterical, one minute they're sobbing, then in an instant screaming and intent upon fighting again. the crowd keeps them apart. two bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede. to the side we see bytes watching everything. it is still too violent a scene for the nurses to come to the women's aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting. bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for a chance to get behind the nurses and on into the hospital. now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some. the nurses come forward into the crowd. bytes moves over closer to the hallways. when the nurses have all gone into the crowd he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital.}
