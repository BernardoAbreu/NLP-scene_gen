<L>__{interior claridge's bar lengthy panning shot}
<A>__{the place is packed with well dressed men and women. the bar is crowded with men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at claridge's bar) smoking, drinking, conversing. at the end of the pan, we discover our heroes entering, greeted by an employee who takes their hats. another view near the bar an attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. her name is nikki and she seems to be in a world all to herself. our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. only cary pays any attention to nikki. after they have all passed her, he pauses to turn and stare. she's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. he looks at the glass in her hand, puzzled. he starts off but then pauses. after a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. cary keeps looking at nikki. he glances at the others and they follow his gaze:}
<B>__{nikki}
<A>__{still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.}
<B>__{the glass}
<A>__{in her hands. between her fingers, we glimpse its contents a complete set of men's false teeth. we pull back to discover that cary has approached her. he's standing right next to her and is staring at the glass. she finally notices him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i beg your pardon. but, if i'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what is that you're drinking?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{teeth.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{teeth?}
<A>__{after another look, cary turns to his friends.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey, it's teeth!}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{teeth?!}
<A>__{shep, bill and francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in amazement at the teeth. nikki is unimpressed by all the attention.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{teeth!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(enthusiastic)}
<D>__{yup. it's a full set upper and lower.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{it's a nice expression.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hey, how come you're with those teeth?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i was just standing here. and a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would i mind holding his teeth for a minute.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{said he wanted to biff somebody.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{biff somebody?! which way did he go?!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{just around to the right.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on, men! we're liable to see a fight.}
<A>__{as quickly as they arrived, shep, bill and francis depart. cary starts after them but stops to politely address nikki who has gone back into her trance.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{would you like to come along?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(as if it were obvious)}
<D>__{oh, no. i have to stay here and mind the man's teeth.}
<A>__{they glance down at the teeth.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, of course.}
<A>__{cary hurries off as nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling.}
