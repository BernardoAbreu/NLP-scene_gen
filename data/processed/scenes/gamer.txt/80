<L>__{interior prison, weight room night}
<A>__{the scream would be comical if it weren't so horrific. with a dozen cons looking on: an asian prisoner is on his knees, fingers deep into the back of his own skull.}
<C>__{asian prisoner}
<D>__{get it out of me...!}
<A>__{he rips into his brain stem with a tiny piece of busted razor, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. he pulls out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor fried potatoes. he lands on a couple of dumbbells, his head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord severed. kable looks on, impassive, emotion internalized. guards push through.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{what the hell happened to this one?}
<A>__{an old black dude lifer answers.}
<C>__{lifer}
<D>__{look like he escaped.}
<A>__{the guards roll their eyes; drag away the body.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{back to your jazzercise, girls...}
<A>__{across the room kable notices a new guy a mean looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would look exactly like hackman. hackman stares straight at kable. there is something in his ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off putting to say the least.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{freak.}
<A>__{freek is there.}
<C>__{freek}
<D>__{tillmans.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{who the hell is that?}
<C>__{freek}
<D>__{new dude, new dude... that's hackman. they say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...}
<A>__{now hackman is looking at kable dead blank. a guard comes up behind hackman and shoves him. hackman turns; the guard gestures him to follow.}
<C>__{hispanic guard }
<D>__{hey kable.}
<A>__{kable turns to look.}
<C>__{hispanic guard }
<D>__{let's go. upgrades.}
