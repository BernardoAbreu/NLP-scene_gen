One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's Younger Sister, ZOE. ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old. It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is. Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE". The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.}
