<L>__{interior gymnasium night}
<A>__{over the sound of grunting... open close on a girl's plump ass. squirming in too tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks. angle widens to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam. trying to get her legs to stand up on it. hanging on for dear life. from somewhere around her, a whistle blows.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{alright, ms. diggs. time!}
<A>__{widen to see the teacher and her class (favor sara, chenille, and nikki). amid snickers, the stout girl ("diggy") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down. clearing the teacher, diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air. gives up the double bird with much attitude. the class loves it. cheers it. until the teacher swerves around.}
<B>__{series of close cuts}
<A>__{chenille on balance beam. competent but average. nikki on balance beam. agile. self assured. good. ... and then tighter still on sara. tentatively approaching the balance beam. mindful of all the eyes on her, all the bated breaths. all waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass. sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb. her legs and body are strong, supple, pliable rubber bands. she flounces across it on her tiptoes. does a flawless split. hops off. looks out. sara's pov teacher and class reacting with shock and surprise. awed. except for nikki. she stands there with her arms folded. simmering. envious. patterson high end of school that day sara. heading down the steps with other students. chenille and diggy break through the logjam, catch up to her.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{yo, snook}
<A>__{sara sees snookie... then patrick... loping her way. she steels herself. he's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up. but patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. a nice twinkle. sara's not entirely immune to it. chenille breaks their eye play, pushes patrick aside. she grabs snookie's arm, indicates sara.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{she needs to get hooked up for feetz. all the way up. sara, give snook twenty dollars.}

<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{so we'll hook up at my house. go together. i will have your i.d.}
