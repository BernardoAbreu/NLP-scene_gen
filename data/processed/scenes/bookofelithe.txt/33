<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom night}
<A>__{carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing room mirror. he sees claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you took your time in there. how long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water?}
<A>__{a subtly accusing tone. it makes claudia nervous.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he wanted to talk.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{oh? what about?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{nothing really. he asked me what it was like to be blind.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{he tell you anything about him?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no. i don't think he likes to talk about himself much.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{yeah, i got that.}
<A>__{claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. i don't think he's going to stay.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{well, we'll just see about that.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you saw him. he's not like the others. you won't be able to smooth talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{who said anything about me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sending solara.}
<A>__{claudia reacts suddenly to this. shocked and angry.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you're doing what?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know how often these walkers get laid? never. least not by anything living or willing. girl like her can be very persuasive.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you can't send her in there with him. he's dangerous, he's a killer!}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you went in there readily enough.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{that's different. solara's just a child, she can't }
<A>__{carnegie sighs, tiring of this.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{she's a grown woman now, claudia. sooner or later you're going to have to accept that. she has to earn her keep around here, same as the rest of us.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{by working as a whore? that's all you think she's fit for?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{we've each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world. some people's gift is more evident than others. solara's sure as hell is.}
<A>__{claudia looks at carnegie in disgust.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what kind of a man are you?}
<A>__{now it's carnegie's turn to get angry. he rounds on her menacingly. she backs off as he approaches.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i'm the kind of man who'd pull a helpless blind girl off the road, a girl who'd been beaten and raped, and give her a place where she can live without fear! without me you'd be just another no eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards, or shoveling dirt down there with the others. that's the kind of man i am!}
<A>__{he has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i don't live without fear. i haven't for a long time now.}
<A>__{carnegie calms himself, backs off. claudia goes to leave.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm not going to let you do this.}
<A>__{carnegie surges forward and pins claudia to the wall.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you're not going to let me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nobody tells me what i can and can't do in my own town. nobody. i built this world, and i am god here! so don't go thinking about screwing with my plans. you know how this works. solara goes against me, you get hurt. you go against me, she gets hurt.}
<A>__{he releases his grip on her.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{so let's not see anybody get hurt. okay?}
<A>__{he speaks more softly now. as he strokes his hand tenderly through claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.}
