<L>__{interior bathroom morning}
<A>__{a showered, suited mike stands before the mirror, knots a tie around his neck.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(uninspired)}
<D>__{today is going to be a good day. i love my job. i am a lucky man. who's lucky? mike o'donnell.}
<A>__{mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself.}
<L>__{interior ed's house living room morning}
<A>__{ed freedman, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers. acupuncture needles protrude from every inch of his body, neck and face... at least 5000 needles. a hot, young acupuncturist adds more to him.}
<C>__{acupuncturist}
<D>__{can you feel your qi flowing freely?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm not sure if its my qi or internal bleeding.}
<A>__{mike enters, shakes his head in amusement.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what are you doing now?}
<A>__{ed looks over, sees mike watching.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{there he is. there's mr. sunshine. fei jing acupuncture. it's all the rage. makes you look five years younger.}
<A>__{ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in pain the entire way. he pours himself a shot of brown liquid from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately spits it all over the place.}
<C>__{ed }
<P>__{(calls to acupuncturist)}
<D>__{what's this brown stuff again?}
<C>__{acupuncturist}
<D>__{rhinoceros urine. pure protein.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{delish!}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{the girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{then why are you letting her stick needles in you?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{because she's hot. but today's not about me. it's about you becoming the new regional sales manager.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i better be. i've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no negativity. negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. you, michael shawn o'donnell, are a winner.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{a winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{are you kidding?! it doesn't get any better than this!}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i gotta get back. my legs just went numb. good luck today.}
<A>__{ed drags painfully back to the acupuncturist.}
