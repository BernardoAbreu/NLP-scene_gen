<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{zorg. jean baptiste emmanuel zorg... nice to see you again}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{i remember you now..the so called art dealer.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{i'm glad you got your memory back, father... because you're going to need it... where are the stones?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{...why on earth do the stones interest you?}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{personally, they are of no interest to me, i'd rather sell weapons..but i have a customer... so tell me...}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{why? what's wrong with me?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life, all you want to do is destroy it.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{ah, father... you are so wrong. let me explain...}
<A>__{zorg leads cornelius into his inner office.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...would you like a drink?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{follow me.. life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. look at this empty glass.}
<A>__{zorg pushes the glass with his finger.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is...}
<A>__{zorg pushes the glass off the table. it shatters on the floor.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{destroyed...}
<A>__{small individual robots, both free wheeling and integrated, come zipping out to clean up the mess.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. so full of..life!}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{they are robots!}
<A>__{a servant comes in pours water in another glass. zorg tosses a cherry into it.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. i gave work to at least fifty people today. the engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong. children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life!}
<A>__{cornelius sits in silence.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{father, by creating a little destruction, i am, in fact, encouraging life! so, in reality, you and i are in the same business!}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{let me reassure you father..i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.}
<A>__{zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink. unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry. unable to breathe, zorg starts to panic.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{where's the robot to pat your back?}
<A>__{zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which trigger a slew of little mechanisms. they pop out all over the desk. true chaos reigns. even a cage appears, holding a souliman aktapan, a fat multicolored beastie, picasso, who seems surprised to be out in daylight. he licks his half dead master in thanks. cornelius gets up and walks around the desk. zorg motions for help.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{can i give you a hand?}
<A>__{cornelius whacks him on the back. the cherry comes flying out. zorg regains control of himself. guards come running in.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{you saved my life... so, i'm going to spare yours.}
<P>__{(to the guards)}
<D>__{throw him out!}
<A>__{the guards throw cornelius out.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{you are a monster, zorg!}
<C>__{zorg}
<P>__{(complimented)}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{the guards drag cornelius out of the office.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but i want those stones. you have an hour.}
<A>__{right arm salutes and hurries out of the office.}
