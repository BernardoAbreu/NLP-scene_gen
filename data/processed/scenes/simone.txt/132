<A>__{a sad but resolute viktor sits in front of his monitor, simone's face full screen. he speaks into the voice synthesizer, simone's face automatically speaking the words he speaks the final time he puts his words in her mouth.}
<D>__{simone viktor what's the matter, viktor? you look so sad. don't you love me anymore?... it's over, isn't it?}
<A>__{he switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{it's the only way, simone. if it's any consolation, you're going to live on in the public's heart like all the other tragic figures that went before their time. there's no love like posthumous love.}
<A>__{on the screen, simone is on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. it's a phoney baloney world. the women are surgically enhanced, the athletes are on steroids, the singers are lip syncing if they're even singing at all, the news is entertainment, the politicians are bought and paid for we're living one big lie. so why shouldn't you live too? you're more authentic than the people who adore you.}
<P>__{(a trace of despair)}
<D>__{and that's the problem. you're looking at the real fraud. i told myself this was all about the work but if that was the truth, it wouldn't matter to me and it does. it wasn't that the artists had no respect for the art. they had no respect for me. someone like you, you have so much love showered on you i just wanted to feel one tiny drop on my face. i'm sorry, simone. here i've been trying to convince the world that you exist, but i was really trying to convince them that i exist. it's not that you aren't human, simone, it's that i am.}
