<A>__{...a security cubicle. chris is the last to enter, barely making it before the door begins to slide shut. ka tchunk! claws penetrate the opening.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{don't worry, it's mindless. it doesn't realize that it's strong enough to push the door open.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{sometimes the dumb get lucky.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{hasn't happened to me, yet.}
<A>__{the hunter growls. its snout darkens the space between door and wall. mucous from its nostrils spits through. after a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. the dark snout disappears. the snorting fades away. followed by a distant...tchung tchung tchung...as the hunter departs. everyone relaxes, visibly. the troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard scientists standing across the room.}

<D>__{my... colleagues. benjamin. toshiro. as far as we know, we are the...only ones.. .left alive. we worked on "c" level. one of the biologists saved us. brought us down here. he knew that... he didn't have long to live. he... started the mechanism... out there, in the corridor.. .and he let it... take him.}

<D>__{you knew.. .about the bomb?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the end for a place like this, when it fails... must be a bomb, yes?}
<A>__{jill looks at chris. his point has been proven.}
<C>__{ada }
<D>__{but now... that you are here... the bomb will not come.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it... already came. ma'am. we brought it. the colonel, here... he's wearing it.}
<A>__{ada looks at the detonator on wesker's belt, at the sequence of blinking lights.}
