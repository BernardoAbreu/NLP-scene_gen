<A>__{the guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse. several hotel employees rush to help them. harry and lloyd get out wearing overly trendy ski garb, complete with fur boots, nasa designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere. the employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as lloyd tips them all handsomely.}

<A>__{the huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies. lloyd is going through it all. harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh god, it's really true. last night i thought i might've been dreaming.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{it's no dream, har. we finally cracked the big time.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and it was so simple. all it took was somebody else's money.}
<A>__{harry lights a cigar with a twenty dollar bill, takes a hearty puff, and}
<B>__{exhales.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{you know, lloyd, i think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today.}
<A>__{he blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what's the big deal? we're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{surfboards? i thought those were beginner's skis.}
<A>__{this suddenly makes sense to harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ahhh. i was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.}
<A>__{lloyd opens a box and holds up a scanty negligee.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{where'd this come from?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{i bought it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i like the feel of it against my skin...}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{...i mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it.}
<A>__{lloyd inspects it more closely.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{harry, how many women do you know who wear a size xxl?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, leave me alone. i'm rich now. i'm supposed to have a few eccentricities.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{enter, parlez vous!}
<A>__{the bell captain, barnard, enters with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm.}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{i brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen. unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested.}
<A>__{lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{all out of boone's farm, huh?}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{you have a rapier wit, sir. i took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: dom perignon.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?}
<A>__{lloyd smiles and over tips him.}
<C>__{barnard}
<D>__{thank you so much, sir.}
<A>__{he puts the tray down, hands lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{oh, one more thing: you can dispense with the 'sir' crap. let's face it, barney, we're all from the same mold.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{we just have a little more dough than you right now.}
<A>__{barnard smiles and exits. harry comes back in the room. he picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger, sending out a resonant ring.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{cocktail hour has commenced!}
<A>__{he starts to open the champagne bottle as lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{hey, later on what do you say we...?}
<A>__{he notices that lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something he's found in the paper.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{lloyd... you okay?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(dumbstruck)}
<D>__{harry, it's her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{mary with the briefcase. this is her...}
<A>__{he shoves the newspaper at harry. close on the headline it reads: swansons to host preservation gala tonight; city's elite expected. underneath this is a photograph of mary with her parents.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{mary swanson...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on, cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball...}
<A>__{roy orbison's "pretty woman" plays over a... montage of harry and lloyd's glamour make over: the boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed. harry and lloyd sit beneath old fashioned hair dryers. the attendants lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both guys' hair in curlers. lloyd's getting shaved by an attendant with a straight razor. suddenly lloyd grabs his neck as if he's been nicked. blood squirts out from between his fingers. the other customers stare in horror at this. lloyd laughs and shows everyone a squeeze ketchup bottle hidden in his hand. only harry and lloyd seem to find this joke amusing. we see them getting their nose hairs clipped. pan down to the floor to reveal a pile of}
<B>__{nose hair clippings.}
<A>__{ then a shot of a man next to them getting a pedicure. pan over to lloyd's bare feet he has toe nails like howard hughes. sparks are flying as an attendant wearing safety goggles tries to sand down lloyd's toenails with an electric sander. harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a massage from a beautiful oriental masseuse. he pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and whispers in her ear. she smiles. next we see the oriental masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off, while harry happily massages her back. the guys are in an expensive haberdashery. harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant black tuxedo. he couldn't look any more suave. the saleman nods, impressed, but lloyd shakes his head no and harry goes back in. harry reappears in another stylish white tuxedo. the salesman looks on hopefully, but lloyd again disapproves. this time harry comes out in a junior prom like sky blue tuxedo, complete with tacky frills. the salesman looks sickened as lloyd give harry the thumbs up. pan across the street from the haberdashery an apprehensive j.p. shay is sitting in a parked car, watching harry and}
