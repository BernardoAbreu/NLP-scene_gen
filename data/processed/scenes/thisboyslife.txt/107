<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's living room night (later)}
<A>__{a drink in one hand, idly fondling champ's ears with the other, dwight is watching the news. on the television we see a distraught lana turner and her daughter, cheryl crane, as the teenaged girl is led into a tall building. while we see this, and then a photograph of a stockily handsome italian man, we hear:}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{... cheryl crane, daughter of lana turner, was held for questioning today in the stabbing death of johnny stompanato, miss turner's companion. a spokesman for miss turner said today that the stabbing was an accident, and that miss turner's daughter will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman called a 'tragic accident.'}
<A>__{suddenly aware of another presence in the room, dwight turns and sees toby, who is standing in the doorway, also listening to the newscast. toby is not watching the television, though, he is staring fixedly at dwight. dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the stompanato murder story continues. he turns slowly back to toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. the sound on the tv fades.}
