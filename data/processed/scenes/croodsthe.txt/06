<L>__{interior crood cave evening}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{come on, come on. darkness brings death! we know this.}
<A>__{the croods run inside the cave. ugga picks up a heavy stick off the floor.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{the moon is full. bath night.}
<P>__{(grumbling, gran tries to run away)}
<D>__{you too, mom.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{run for your life.}
<A>__{ugga pulls gran back.}
<C>__{gran }
<D>__{i don't want to lose my protective layer.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{mom, you've got ants.}
<P>__{(hanging sandy up)}
<A>__{whack! like she's cleaning a rug, ugga smacks sandy hard with the stick. dust and bugs fly off of her.}
<C>__{ugga }
<D>__{see? sandy doesn't fuss.}
<A>__{ugga claps her hands together and sandy knows to let go. she hits the floor and scampers away.}
<C>__{gran}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaah.}
<A>__{grug enters and looks around the cave.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{is she still out there?}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{you know she hates the cave, grug.}
<A>__{on eep clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above crood cave. she raises her hand to `catch' a few more moments of sun.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{please come back tomorrow.}
<A>__{on grug getting his `bath.'}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{how can she not like the cave? it's so cozy.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{it is a little, dark, grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{it's not that dark.}
<A>__{grug is finished with his bath.}
<C>__{grug }
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{eep! eep?}
<A>__{eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance. curious, she begins to climb even higher. grug leaves the cave, searching for her.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{come on, i gotta close the cave...}
<A>__{on grug exiting the cave... grug sees that eep is at the very top.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{eep!}
<A>__{eep continues to climb.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{okay, okay!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{behind grug, the bear owl appears up the canyon. it spots grug and the open cave and races to attack. grug sees the bearowl in full attack mode.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{eep! come down!!}
<A>__{grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, allowing eep to jump down and dart into the cave. grug barely gets the cave closed in time.}
<C>__{grug }
