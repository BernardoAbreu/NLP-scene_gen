<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior level three, desert day}
<A>__{alex and nick fall from the sky onto the dunes. they lie there a moment, gasping for breath. they're an odd sight, two people soaked from head to toe, dropped in the middle of a bone dry desert... ...and a blue one at that. there's an eerie stillness about this level, even the clouds above are frozen. nothing lives here now, and nothing ever will. nick coughs, sucking in air. alex rises halfway, pulling up her visor. she stares at the golden key which she clutches in her hand. her wet hair hangs about her face in strings and she shivers.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(looking at the key)}
<D>__{so that's what we almost died for?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{one of them, anyway...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you see it? the screamer?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(looking away)}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it.}
<A>__{nick glances at his wrist display.}
<B>__{display}
<A>__{even as he watches, the first of the ten "time elapsed" blocks blinks away.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{christ...no time...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{there never is.}
<A>__{nick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around. they are on the top of a massive dune.}
<B>__{their thrasher boards}
<A>__{now looks like snowboards. it doesn't take nick long to figure out what to do.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we can take the dunes down like a ski slope. pretend you're on a snowboard.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(snapping down her visor)}
<D>__{never been on a snowboard.}
<A>__{nick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune. he begins to slide down, slowly picking up speed.}
<B>__{a series of shots...}
<A>__{...as alex and nick negotiate the dunes. they glide over the sand gracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping in wide arcs... under any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives. alex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the thrasherboard. later the dunes gradually level out. alex and nick slow to a stop. alex flips up her visor. her face is covered with grime now, hardened.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i guess we're walking from here on out.}
<A>__{they pick up their boards and walk.}
