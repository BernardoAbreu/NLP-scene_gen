<L>__{exterior santa monica pier night}
<A>__{ryan struggles with mooney. the crowd completely ignores them in favor of the raucous concert. in the heat of battle, ryan's cellphone clatters by chloe' s feet.}
<C>__{mooney}
<P>__{(sweating profusely)}
<D>__{jesus, kid, calm down!!}
<A>__{trying to break mooney's stronghold, ryan shoves him backwards, slamming his injured shoulder into the pier}
<B>__{railing.}
<A>__{mooney screams out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing ryan, who breaks away and turns to see mooney collapse to the ground, holding his blood soaked shoulder. ryan looks over to chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{oh my god }
<P>__{(checking mooney)}
<D>__{someone call 911!}
<A>__{a crowd starts to gather when ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back. tomlin's gun.}
<C>__{tomlin}
<D>__{it's over kid.}
<A>__{fuck! ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end of the pier. mooney from his prone position, he catches a glimpse of tomlin backing ryan quietly into the crowd. not trying to help. not calling for an ambulance. in that instant, mooney knows he's been betrayed. tomlin's in on this.}
<C>__{tomlin }
<D>__{for all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. where is it?}
<A>__{just then, greer appears through the crowd ahead of him. like a nightmare, he closes in. ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{aw shit...}
<A>__{ryan's world is spinning the noise, the crowds, the}
<B>__{tension...}
<A>__{he kicks back hard into tomlin's shin. it is enough for tomlin to release his grip and ryan bolts. tomlin recovers and raises his gun to get a bead on ryan, but it causes the crowd around him to panic.}
<C>__{crowd goer }
<D>__{dude's gotta gun!}
<A>__{ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see greer and tomlin quickly gaining ground. he has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal with greer and tomlin. ryan decides on the ocean. he runs to a man fishing with his son and uses their ice chest as a step. just as he jumps the rail tomlin gets off a shot! sliiiiiicee!!! the bullet tears through ryan's shoulder as he spins headlong into the pacific! tomlin and greer run to the railing and see ryan hit the choppy water below.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{under the pier. go! go!}
<B>__{underwater pov}
<A>__{ryan flails, panicking, exhaling all his air and sucking in the dark water of the ocean }
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{ryan is struggling. bleeding. sinking. dying. his lungs convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red hot needles are pushing their way through his chest. the waves pound against the thick pylons below the pier. just as ryan comes up for air he's slammed into a wooden pylon! ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater, bashing him repeatedly against the pillars. it's not pretty. as he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back and forth underwater like a rag doll.}
