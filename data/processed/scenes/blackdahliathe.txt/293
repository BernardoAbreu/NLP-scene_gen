<A>__{bucky sits at a light, staring north. scaffolding drapes the hollywoodland sign. movie lights have been set up, capturing the event on film. his attention turns to christine's photoplay on the seat next to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the mack sennett revival: a reproduction of the hollywoodland sign across the top of the page, and below it the words "keystone kops at the admiral theater air conditioned!" below that a still from a keystone kops movie, registering huge and loud and wrong: three keystone kops standing between pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall inset with egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them. unmistakably the background that appeared in the linda martin betty short porn film. cars honking behind him. bucky's transfixed by the image. the light is green. he jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.}
