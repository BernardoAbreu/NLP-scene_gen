<C>__{matt}
<D>__{does he know what we're doing?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{he knows everything.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{dude, your wife is dying and then you find out she's been stepping out on you? that's harsh.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{get in the car.}
<L>__{exterior montage tbd exterior thorson house day}
<A>__{matt watches retired military man scott thorson (70s) mumble as he sits at a table glancing over documents. sid is splayed out on a nearby lounge chair. alex seated at his feet. every so often a pet parrot squawks loudly.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{this is like reading korean.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scott, i will be happy to walk you through it.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<P>__{(tossing the papers)}
<D>__{jibber jabber.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's an advanced directive basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. no prolonged mechanical ventilation, no }
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{i know goddamn well what it says. says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it.}
<A>__{he stares off into space.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{gramps, are you okay?}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. always a thoughtful girl. a strong girl. a hell of a lot stronger than her brother. barry whines his way through life. might even be a homosexual, for all i know.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, scott, i don't think so.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{and she's stronger than you, matt. she lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. all that money you refuse to use what the hell good is it? and now you and your family are cashing in your chips what the hell for? maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{grandpa.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{and you, alexandra. putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. shame on you. you should try to be more like her. she's a good girl. she's a good girl.}
<A>__{the old man climbs to his feet and takes a few steps away. hands on hips, he looks up as though gauging the weather. then he clears his throat, wipes his face with his sleeve, turns back.}
<C>__{scott thorson }
<D>__{you all want a drink?}
<A>__{as he wanders away toward the kitchen later scott returns pushing a little drink cart. behind him trails his wife alice. an alzheimer's victim, alice is a sweet woman, alert but unable to grasp or recall.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{oh, do we have guests?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{hi, alice. good to see you. it's me, matt.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{good to see you too.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<P>__{(hugging her)}
<D>__{hi, tutu.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{that's alexandra.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{she's your granddaughter. and this is your son in law matt. this is your family. well, except this kid. i don't know who the hell he is.}
<P>__{(to sid)}
<D>__{who are you? why are you here?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{he's my friend.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{good afternoon.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{alice, we're going to go to queen's hospital today and see elizabeth.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{we are? queen elizabeth? that's wonderful. i've never met a queen before. i have to put on a nice dress.}
<A>__{sid bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{is she serious?}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{you be quiet, son.}
<P>__{(then )}
<D>__{no, alice. our elizabeth. our baby. we need to go visit her in the hospital. she needs us, just like when she was a little girl. let's think about what she might want in her room. we'll take it to her and put it next to her bed.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{but she's a queen. i have to look good for a queen. don't you want me to look good?}
<A>__{sid laughs again.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{shut up, alice.}
<P>__{(then )}
<D>__{sorry, old gal. you go ahead and say whatever you want.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i've never met a queen before.}
<A>__{when sid snickers again, scott thorson approaches him and glares.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i'm sorry, man. i was just laughing. it's funny. i think she knows she's being funny.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{i'm going to hit you.}
