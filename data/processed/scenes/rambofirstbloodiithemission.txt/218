<L>__{interior isolation cell}
<A>__{darkness. the door is kicked open and rambo is there, silhouetted. brewer is a sorry mess, but alive. he raises his head, blinking.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{gawd, you look awful.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{you comin'?}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(trying to rise)}
<D>__{hold your pantyhose. here, gimme a hand.}
<A>__{rambo helps brewer, who is nearly crippled with pain, to his feet, and supports him as they exit.}
<L>__{exterior camp courtyard}
<A>__{the seven prisoners are helping one another into the copter as rambo and brewer hobble up.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{can you handle the door gun?}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{duck soup.}
<A>__{tay and vinh are still face down and de fravio covers them with an ak 47, found in the rubble. smoke swirls in the idling rotor wash as the barracks begins to burn.}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{am i dreaming this? this is not real, right?}
<P>__{(to guards)}
<D>__{i oughta grease you pricks, but i've known you too long.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{let's go, de fravio. move it!}
<A>__{when de fravio is aboard, crammed in with the others in the main bay, rambo remounts the m 60 and jumps into the pilot's seat. he brings up the rpms. the turbine whine increases. brewer, crouched behind rambo, yells forward.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{we got company. you better pull some pitch, buddy.}
<A>__{behind them, diving out of the sun's glare, is podovsk's massive assault helicopter. rambo pops the huey off the ground and runs hard at the treeline. the mil mi 24 nosegun begins firing and the ground erupts behind the huey, fountains of earth chasing it as it climbs out. at full climb the laden huey barely clears the trees and rambo immediately banks tight to get out of the nosegun's field of fire. the soviet chopper tightens its arc, but swings wide, and rambo spirals back. brewer swings the door gun and gets off a long burst as the ground reels dizzyingly below and the horizon tilts.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{brewer! you know what that thing's packing?}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{it's a soviet mil mi 24. probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{rambo noses the huey down, building speed. tail high, it shoots across the treetops, its nose radio antenna ripping through the uppermost foliage.}
<B>__{the soviet copter}
<A>__{rolls on its side in a tight turn, despite its bulk. twice the size and power of the huey, and faster at the top end, the high performance assault ship is a formidable opponent. but rambo pits skill against technology, using the agility of his craft as his primary strategy.}
<B>__{angle back}
<A>__{past the dodging huey as the soviet ship falls in behind, steadily gaining.}
<B>__{past brewer}
<A>__{who flinches as trees rush by seemingly inches away at 120 mph. the pows are flung against the bulkheads as the huey plummets and swerves.}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna be sick.}
