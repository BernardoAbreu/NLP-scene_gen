<L>__{interior luciano kitchen day}
<A>__{antonio luciano sits silently at the table, along with frankie and bartolo, all anxiously watching rosalie prepare sunday dinner. the ham still hangs over the sink. sweating from the heat, antonio flaps the coat of his ill fitting peasant's suit. irritated, rosalie slaps a bottle of wine on the table.}

<D>__{dinner will be ready when the dinner is ready.}
<A>__{charlie enters from the bedroom wearing a blue seersucker suit. antonio pours frankie a niggardly portion of the wine.}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{antonio}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{i work from seven until seven. every day. but on sunday i can only afford one bottle of wine. how can my son, who does not work at all, afford a new suit?}
<A>__{charlie grabs the wine bottle, filling frankie's glass, then his father's. antonio looks to frankie, then back to charlie.}
<C>__{antonio luciano}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{i know of the things you do.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door. antonio looks up with trepidation.}

<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{when you wanted money to buy a bed, you were under my feet.}
<A>__{moliari marches into the apartment, looking for collateral. the pickings are mighty thin. antonio trails helplessly behind.}

<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{saturday i will pay double.}
<A>__{moliari turns to face antonio. his voice falling to a whisper.}
<C>__{moliari}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{so i should ask don maranzano?}
<A>__{an edge of panic creeps into antonio's voice.}
<C>__{antonio luciano}
<D>__{no. no. no. don maranzano? no.}
<A>__{moliari's eyes light upon the prosciutto hanging over the sink. rosalie moves to block his path, but moliari pushes her aside, and lifts the ham off the hook.}
<C>__{rosalie luciano}
<D>__{please, no... an to nio.}
<A>__{rosalie grabs the ham from moliari, as charlie picks up a carving knife and jumps up from the table. utterly impotent, antonio calls to his wife.}
<C>__{antonio luciano}
<D>__{rosalie. no!}
<A>__{moliari wrestles the ham back from rosalie, and back hands her across the face. antonio grabs charlie, and twists the knife from his hand. moliari retreats to the door with the ham.}
<C>__{moliari}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{and you must still pay double!}
<A>__{as moliari exits, charlie pulls away from his father, raises an arm threateningly, then drops it in disgust.}
