<A>__{sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. a strong wind bends them back, showing their light green bellies. this is a modest house in a row of modest houses. propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb. curtis laforche(35) stands in his driveway. his eyes, locked on the sky, narrow as he stares at... a storm cell stretching out on the horizon in front of him. it's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds. they swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground. curtis stands, awestruck. the clouds move fast overhead. he looks up as they overtake his position. a light rain begins. the rain pats the ground. it makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt. he watches it hit the concrete, falling harder now. he notices something strange. the rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. he pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. he holds his palm out flat in front of him. the rain pools. he rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. it's an amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil. curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now. jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. the wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree. curtis stands alone at the base of the surging storm cell. title: take shelter}
