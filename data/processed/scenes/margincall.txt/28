<L>__{interior backseat of a black lincoln town car}
<A>__{seth and peter sit in the back of the plush car as it struggles through traffic up town. seth reaches into his bag and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. their conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be listening.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you want one?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{peter gives him a bit of a look.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about...}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this pointerior}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i guess that's true.}
<A>__{peter looks out the window at all the people on the street enjoying the thursday night.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look at these people.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming.}
<A>__{seth's demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to project much in the way of stress.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{right?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i try not to let work get to me.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i've noticed that about you actually.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look, we are twenty three years old...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{twenty seven.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{whatever, same thing, i made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some otb somewhere putting it all on number seven. and at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins.}
<A>__{peter continues to look out the window in silence for a long beat. then with a little sly humor and a smile to seth:}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you do know it's a little more complicated than that?}
<A>__{seth's phone starts playing a ring tone. he looks down at the texterior}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it's will... he wants to know if we've found him? what do i tell him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{tell him that we haven't found him.}
