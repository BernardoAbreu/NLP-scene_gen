<L>__{interior waiting room new gaza hospital night later}
<A>__{lincoln stands waiting. there are chairs but he's too tense to sit. katherine and dr. abrams now enter. lincoln looks at them, expectantly. there's a pause. then dr. abrams speaks }
<C>__{dr. abrams}
<D>__{your friend... she has pneumonia. at a very advanced stage. its progress has been unchecked by her immune system.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{c a n you help her?}
<C>__{dr. abrams}
<D>__{we have two options... one is a super b i o t i c . but there's the risk her immune system might bow out of the fight. the other is a nodal transfusion. katherine has agreed to be the donor. but the new antibodies may not conform fully. they m a y decide to attack the baby...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't understand any of this.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{he means that by trying to help her, we could lose her. or lose the baby.}
<C>__{dr. abrams}
<D>__{or , if we do nothing, both. her immune system is... remarkably unstable. if we don't act, the infection will take over.}
<A>__{lincoln lowers into a chair. he feels a pain somewhere. he can't quite pin down where. or what caused it. or why it hurts so bad.}
