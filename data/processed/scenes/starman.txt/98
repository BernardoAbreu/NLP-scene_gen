<A>__{jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you bastard.}
<A>__{her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might cry. the star man sees the center lane is open. he checks his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. the car is still rolling when jenny makes her move. she throws open the door and, by the time the star man turns around, she is out and running.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{jennyhaydn!}
<A>__{he takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car lurches into the cross traffic. he clambers back behind the wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the other car waiting at the light.}
