<L>__{exterior the comanche encampment wide angle shot dawn light}
<A>__{the camp is sleeping. a dog yaps shrilly. one of the tepee flaps opens and scar steps out. he picks up a stone or a chunk of wood and throws it. the dog yelps and runs off. scar's air is troubled, suspicious. he heads for the horse herd. the camp sleeps on. close shot ethan at rim of a mesa dawn light his face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction. he looks back along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the ranger company. then he squirms back, retrieving his hat. full shot head of ranger column dawn light sam, seeing ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a signal for halt and waits. ethan scrambles down the trail to join him. he takes the reins of his horse from martin.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{we can get within 500 yards... there's a hogback to the south.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{how many, would you say?}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{enough to go around... i'd say about a dozen apiece... mount 'em up!}
<A>__{he moves as though to mount, but martin steps forward.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{wait! we go chargin' in, they'll kill her... and you know it.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{it's what i'm countin' on.}
<A>__{sam stares at him, but martin isn't surprised.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i know you are... only it ain't goin' to be that way... she's alive...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{livin' with comanches ain't bein' alive...}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(same tone)}
<D>__{she's alive... better she's alive and livin' with comanches than her brains bashed out...}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{there sure is! i'm going to tell you somethin'... i wasn't going to speak of it... but i will tell you now. did you notice them scalps strung on scar's lance?}
<P>__{(martin nods)}
<D>__{did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? long... wavy hair...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i saw it... and don't try to tell me it was aunt martha's or lucy's...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you don't remember it, but i remember. that was your mother's scalp!}
<A>__{martin stares, quick disbelief in his eyes. but ethan's eyes hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i didn't want to tell you... but maybe it's your right to know.}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{now mount up, son...}
<A>__{sam puts his hand on martin's elbow as though to turn him to his duty. but martin jerks the arm away.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it don't change it... all i'm askin' is a chance to sneak in there... an' try to get her out before you come chargin' in.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{what if you're caught?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it won't tell 'em anything, will it! just a man alone...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i say no!}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{go ahead, son... but at the first alarm, we're comin' in and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...}
<A>__{ethan looks long and hard at martin, then reaches into his shirt for the folded, dirty, dog eared paper that was his will. slowly he tears it into shreds.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{it's your funeral...}
<A>__{martin squats and starts pulling off his boots. he glances up as charlie maccorry comes over, an indian blanket in his hands. he tosses it onto martin's shoulder.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{here... you fight like a comanch... maybe this'll help ya pass as one.}
<A>__{then he grins and extends his hand. martin takes it and they shake as charlie pulls him to his feet. martin drops his hat, and then at a crouching run he heads for the distant comanche camp. full shot from behind clayton and ethan, toward martin as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward the unseen camp. clayton waves an arm at his men and starts leading out in a somewhat different direction. full shot the rangers, favoring clayton and ethan they are leading their horses down the slope, still under the lee of the butte, when two riders are seen approaching at a fast gallop lt. greenhill and his courier. (the latter is a bugler).}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{what in...?}
<C>__{greenhill}
<P>__{(calling still distant)}
<D>__{captain clayton... captain!}
<A>__{sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to greenhill to shut up. greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides in.}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{go on! whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??}
<C>__{greenhill}
<P>__{(blankly)}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{never mind... your pa know you're out here?}
<C>__{greenhill}
<D>__{yes, sir... troop's about ten miles back... the colonel sent me looking for you...}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(dismissing him)}
<D>__{well you found me... good work, son... good work.}
<A>__{he starts away. greenhill follows.}
<C>__{greenhill}
<D>__{if there's anything i can do, sir...}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{god forbid... no, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at... and where he's at...}
<C>__{greenhill}
<D>__{but he knows that, sir... can't i stay, sir?}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{all right... but keep your eye on me, boy... i'm the hard case you're up against here not these childish savages... if you don't hear me first time i holler, you better read my mind... i don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...}
<C>__{greenhill}
<D>__{yes, sir...}
<A>__{he whips out his sabre to the imminent peril of captain sam who quickly shifts out of the way.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{watch that knife, boy!}
<A>__{then sam continues away and the rangers after him.}
