<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{travis is pacing back and forth on broadway just beyond the palantine headquarters. he checks his watch.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{april 26, 1972. four o'clock p.m. i took betsy to the mayfair coffee shop on broadway...}
<L>__{interior coffee shop}
<A>__{travis and betsy are sitting in a booth of a small new york coffee shop. they both have been served coffee; travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands. as travis speaks v.o., waitress brings their orders: apple pie for travis, fruit compote for betsy.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{i had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese. i think that was a good selection. betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish. she could have had anything she wanted.}
<A>__{betsy's conversation interrupts travis' v.o.:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{we've signed up 15.000 palantine volunteers in new york so far. the organizational problems are becoming just staggering.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i know what you mean. i've got the same problems. i just can't get things organized. little things, i mean. like my room, my possessions. i should get one of those signs that says, "one of these days i'm gonna organezizied".}
<A>__{travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. the very sight of it makes one's heart proud. betsy cannot help but be caught up in travis' gin. travis' contagious, quicksilver moods cause:}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{travis, i never ever met anybody like you before.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i can believe that.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{where do you live?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(evasive)}
<D>__{oh, uptown. you know. some jointerior it ain't much.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i had a regular job for a while, days. you know, doin' this, doin' that. but i didn't have anything to do at night. i got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. so i decided to works nights. it ain't good to be alone, you know.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{after this job, i'm looking forward to being alone for a while.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{yeah, well...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{in a cab you get to meet people. you meet lotsa people. it's good for you.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what kind of people?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{just people people, you know. just people.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{had a dead man once.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{he'd been shot. i didn't know that. he just crawled into the back seat, said "west 45th street" and conked out.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i shot the meter off, for one thing. i knew i wasn't goimg to get paid. then i dropped him off at the cop shop. they took him.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that's really something.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. especially when the moon's out.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{the moon?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{the full moon. one night i had three or four weirdoes in a row and i looked up and, sure enough, there it was the full moon.}
<A>__{betsy laughs. travis continues:}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{oh, yeah. people will do anything in front of a taxi driver. i mean anything. people too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you.}
<P>__{(a bitterness emerges)}
<D>__{it's like you're not even there, not even a person. nobody knows you.}
<A>__{betsy cuts travis' bitterness short:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{com'on, travis. it's not that bad. i take lots of taxis.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i know. i could have picked you up.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{late one night. about three. at the plaza.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{three in the morning? i don't think so. i have to go to bed early. i work days. it must have been somebody else.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{no. it was you. you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks.}
<A>__{betsy, realizing travis remembers her precisely, scrambles for a polite rationale for her behavior:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you're right! now i remember! it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. the next day i was completely bushed. it was unbelievable.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{if it wasn't for a drunk i would have picked you up. he wanted to go to the dmz.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{the dmz?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{south bronx. the worst. i tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so i had to take him. that's the law. otherwise i would have picked you up.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that would have been quite a coincidence.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{you'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. people have patterns. they do more or less the same things every day. i can tell.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{well, i don't go to the plaza every night.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i didn't mean you. but just ordinary people. a guy i know dough boy met his wife that way. they got to talking. she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that's very romantic. some of your fares must be interesting. see any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{i got this guy who makes lasers. not regular lasers, not the big kind. little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. like a ray gun. zap.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what hours do you work?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i work a single, which means there's no replacement no second man on the cab. six to six, sometimes eight. seventy two hours a week.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you mean you work seventy two hours a week.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{sometimes 76 or 80. sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning. eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you must be rich.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(big affectionate smile)}
<D>__{it keeps ya busy.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you know what you remind me of?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that song by kris kristofferson, where it's said "like a pusher, party truth, partly ficition, a walking contradiction".}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i'm no pusher, betsy. honest. i never have pushed.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i didn't mean that, travis. just the part about the contradiction.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(more at ease)}
<D>__{oh. who was that again?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{the singer?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{yeah. yes. i don't follow music too much.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{kris kristofferson.}
<A>__{travis looks at betsy intently and they exchange smiles.}
