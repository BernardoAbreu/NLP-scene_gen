<A>__{he gets out of the car, and jenny watches him as he crosses the road. outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a large west indian family, mother, father, three or four small children and a dog. they are surrounded by what appears to be all their worldly goods. david squats down on his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the smallest. then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the family down the path. he unlocks the door and leads them inside. in an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering down anxiously.}
