<L>__{exterior 1284 south tremaine, neighborhood night}
<A>__{cold for la. walking scanning, .45 flush against my leg. sticking to shadows. cross the street: two homes down. quiet steps. closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter... glance back up at the window, lucille gone a forearm shiver flashes from nowhere blunts blasts the back of my head. nose first into asphalt. too angry to black out. spit blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{stop }
<A>__{still unsure what hit me. pick up my gun, clear my nose of gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting away: peeper. wipe away impact tears, aim, realize my trigger finger is dislocated bent back ugly. tuck the gun use my left hand to pop it back in deep growl re aim: pop pop pop. the peeper pitches. visible in the streetlight: a red puff off his right shoulder. headlights at end of the block, behind me, come to life now baritone of a big v 8. peeper fighting for balance, keeps running. i sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood trail, panting, bleeding my own trail. lift my eyes to see the peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard. neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. i cross the street those headlights swerve hard in front of me: black buick. i look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter panel. i bounce off like someone yanked a leash. crumble yell. hands pick me up. i fight back before i even see at whom i'm swinging: square jawed types, eyes hidden by bureau derbies. welles noonan gets out of the passenger side of the buick. punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to write home about. my gun clatters to the ground.}
