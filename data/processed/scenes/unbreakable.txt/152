<L>__{exterior residential street night}
<A>__{the man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. no one is out walking except him and david dunne fifty feet behind. the orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. the uniformed man walks slower in this block. he looks around carefully as he moves. he turns into a driveway of one of the homes. he stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. david stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. he stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.}
