<L>__{6. interior library day}
<D>__{there are six tables in two rows of three. claire is sitting at the front table. brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. andrew comes in and points at the chair next to claire at the front table. she shrugs and he sits there. in walks bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. he walks over to where brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the library. brian reluctantly gets up and moves. bender sits at the table where brian was and puts his feet up. allison walks in. she walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind brian. andrew and claire look at each other and snicker. brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. enter richard vernon, a teacher. he holds a stack of papers in his left hand. he addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{well...well. here we are! i want to congradulate you for being on time... claire raises her hand.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{excuse me, sir? i think there's been a mistake. i know it's detention, but...um...i don't think i belong in here... vernon doesn't care. he just continues to talk.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{it is now seven oh six. you have exactly eight hours and fifty four minutes to think about why you're here. to ponder the error of your ways... bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his mouth again. claire looks like she is going to gag.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{...and you may not talk. you will not move from these seats. he glances up at bender and points at him.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{...and you... vernon pulls the chair out from under bender's feet.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{...will not sleep. alright people, we're gonna try something a little different today. we are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{is this a test? vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice of bender.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{and when i say essay...i mean essay. i do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. is that clear mr. bender? bender looks up.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{crystal...}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{good. maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. maybe you'll even decide whether or not you care to return. brian raises his hand and then stands.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you know, i can answer that right now sir...that'd be "no", no for me. 'cause...}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{sit down johnson...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{thank you sir... he sits.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{my office... vernon points.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{...is right across that hall. any monkey business is ill advised... he looks around at them.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{...any questions?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{yeah...i got a question. vernon looks at him suspiciously.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{does barry manilow know you raid his wardrobe?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{i will give you the answer to that question, mr. bender, next saturday. don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns. vernon leaves.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{that man...is a brownie hound... everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud snapping sound. brian turns and looks and it is allison, biting her nails. bender's eyes widen as he turns to look. everyone is looking now. allison notices them looking at her.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{you keep eating your hand and you're not gonna be hungry for lunch... allison spits part of her nail at bender.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i've seen you before, you know... we see vernon look out from his office. we see brian playing with his pen.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{who do i think i am? who are you? who are you? he attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top under his upper lip.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i am a walrus... bender looks at him in utter confusion. brian notices this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth embarrassed. bender and brian begin to take their jackets off at the same time. they both notice this. brian stops removing his jacket. bender takes his all the way off. brian rubs his hands together and pretends to be cold. he pulls his jacket back on. he turns and looks at bender who is still staring at him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it's the shits, huh? bender glares at him and brian utters an uncomfortable laugh. bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper. he throws it at claire. it misses and goes over claire's head. andrew and claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore bender. bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a song. nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i can't believe this is really happening to me... bender stops "singing" abruptly.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{oh, shit! what're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{bender}
