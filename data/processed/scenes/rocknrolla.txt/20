<L>__{interior sports arena day}
<A>__{close up on the back of uri (russian jew, 40s, slick, and well groomed, he is our mr. blue eyes) overlooking his sports arena. we stay on the back of uri's head while he is talking to lenny.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{glad you could join us here lenny.}
<C>__{lenny cole}
<D>__{it's nice to see you uri.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(there is a pause)}
<D>__{i can see we are very much alike you and i lenny. we like to get things done.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's it going to cost me?}
<C>__{lenny cole}
<D>__{first, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal. with out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{second, with government policy as it so stands we both know it's unlikely that you'd ever get that consent.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result.}
<A>__{we cut to u: ri unfazed, he just wants the figure.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{so lenny,..... how much?}
<C>__{lenny cole}
<D>__{seven million euros.}
<A>__{still unfazed.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{i expect a guarantee that i have consent within six months and no red tape.}
<C>__{lenny cole}
<D>__{that's right uri, you can consider that done.}
<A>__{pause while tension stews, then,...}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{drink! follow me.}
