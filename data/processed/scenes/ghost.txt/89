<B>__{angle}
<A>__{oda mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet. one of the ghosts draws close. oda mae's eyes roll up into her head. then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs. we see the spirit pull back and dive right into oda mae. oda mae gulps. her nostrils flare. her eyes bulge.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{oh, lord! stop! whatcha doin' to me?}
<A>__{oda mae's body goes into bizarre convulsions as the ghost tries to move inside her. she looks strangely stuffed and enormously uncomfortable. sam and the others watch in astonishment as she tries to speak, but nothing comes out. then suddenly the ghost speaks through oda mae.}

<A>__{ortisha smiles excitedly.}
<C>__{ortisha}
<D>__{orlando, do you like it? it's autumn sunrise.}
<A>__{suddenly oda mae's body begins to shake wildly and her voice booms out, screaming with all her might.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{get out of here, you little shit!}
<A>__{with frightening speed, she sends the spirit catapulting out of her body. clara and louise jump up. oda mae is shaking.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{ortisha}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{orlando!?}
<B>__{angle orlando}

<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{what happened to me? i can barely move.}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{you should know better than to try that. it's not worth it. it'll wipe you out for days.}

<C>__{ortisha}
<D>__{orlando?}
<A>__{ortisha looks around the room, befuddled. clara and louise aren't sure what to do.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast. the ghosts, too, begin passing through the wall. oda mae lays her head on the table. suddenly her whole body begins heaving. she is starting to cry. sam is surprised.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oda mae, what's wrong?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{out! i said out! that means you, too!}
<A>__{sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the others through the wall.}
