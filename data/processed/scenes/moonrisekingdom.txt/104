<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{you said ten days or less.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that was a lie.}
<C>__{gadge}
<D>__{didn't you ever think about what would happen next?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not to my recollection.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you're a traitor to our family.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{good. i want to be.}

<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{what do i do about this?}
<A>__{captain sharp shrugs. he says, resigned:}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{give him his mail.}
<A>__{scout master ward turns to sam. he holds out the envelope. sam takes it. he opens it. he reads. suzy watches him from across the boat. she calls out anxiously:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{they can't invite me back.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{i gave them too much aggravation.}
<A>__{suzy stands up. she says as she starts across the boat:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{let me read it.}
<A>__{sam holds out the note. mr. bishop pulls suzy back down to her seat. he stands up, himself, and walks over to sam. he takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. he opens the door and presses him forward. sam stumbles down the steps and looks back. mr. bishop shuts the door. captain sharp glares at him. suzy says icily:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that's child abuse.}
<A>__{mr. bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down again. he gives suzy a direct order:}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{be advised: the two of you will never see each other again. those were your last words. do you understand?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(darkly)}
<D>__{i'd be careful if i were you. one of these days somebody's going to be pushed too far, and who knows what they're capable of.}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{is that a threat?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{it's a warning.}
<A>__{suzy looks from captain sharp to mrs. bishop and back to mr. bishop. mr. bishop falls silent.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i wish i knew what makes you tick.}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{please, terminate this conversation.}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<P>__{(to lionel)}
<D>__{she's saying that to me?}
<A>__{lionel shakes his head bitterly. suzy stares out to sea. scout master ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door, and goes inside.}
