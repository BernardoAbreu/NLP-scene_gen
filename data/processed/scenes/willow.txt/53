<A>__{up above, willow charges along the balcony. madmarti gan juggles the baby and whips the reins. the wagon pulls away, iron workers scrambling after it. willow flings himself off the balcony. the brownies tumble out of his pocket. they all land in the back of the wagon as it takes off. it has stopped raining. in the stable under the tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the mud, and the nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the traffic jam.}
