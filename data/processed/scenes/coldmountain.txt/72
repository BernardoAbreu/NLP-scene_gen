<A>__{inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, the crop high and thick around him. he stops, hearing something. riders. he wades into the field, seeking cover in the tall crop, lying in the dirt. horses appear. home guard men on patrol, a chain gang of prisoners: slaves, deserters in tow, a couple of federal soldiers. they have dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the home guard. inman waits until they're well out of sight. as he gets to his feet in the great fields, another body appears, then another, then another, then another, all slaves on the run dotted around the field. he walks to the road, paying no heed to them. they assemble, paying no heed to him and move off in the opposite direction. inman turns, looks at them.}
