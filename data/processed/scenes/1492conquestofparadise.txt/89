<L>__{interior chief guarionex's hut night}
<A>__{in the half light, figures wreathed in smoke columbus, mendez and utapan watch the chief guarionex putting a spanish helmet on his head. the helmet is too big, almost covering his eyes. the elders appraise the gift with solemn wonder. in return, guarionex hands columbus a parcel made of leaves. columbus unwraps them. inside: a gold grimacing mask. the first real piece of gold. columbus is unable to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of the metal. he waits for the chief to speak, but the chief only looks at him. on the ground, we see other presents offered by the spaniards trinkets, and necklaces...}
