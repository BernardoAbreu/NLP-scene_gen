<L>__{exterior field and scoreboard}

<L>__{exterior the hamilton pool hot afternoon several}
<B>__{weeks later}
<A>__{linda and stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in string tie bathing suits. they are listening to the music of tom petty's "breakdown" playing on the living room stereo. linda luxuriously applies suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and writhing strokes. stacy reads a book. it's called total orgasm. several beats pass.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i sent a letter to doug today. i will be so glad when he gets out here.}
<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(engrossed in book)}
<D>__{you really ought to look at this, linda. there's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. it's like school.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why don't you put your mother's secret book back?}
<A>__{linda continues regally applying lotion.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{listen to this... 'what are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(automatic)}
<D>__{okay, penis, that's one, balls...}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you're right. probably penis, mouth and neck.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{all right! here's another one. 'the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{climax together.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{does that ever happen?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no. but it's a nice idea.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{listen to this ... it says 'most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'}
<A>__{linda stops applying lotion, considers that thought.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{well... they obviously don't know about doug.}
<A>__{they laugh. linda resumes applying the lotion. stacy continues reading the book. a couple of beats pass.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{how long does doug take?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i don't know. thirty to forty minutes.}
<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what's doug do in chicago?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he works for the airline. he'll be out here. you'll meet him.}
<A>__{stacy looks at linda, almost disbelieving.}
<C>__{linda }
<P>__{(wistful)}
<D>__{he's no high school boy.}
<A>__{there is a noise by the side fence leading into the hamiltons' backyard. it is mark ratner and mike damone. they are already wearing swimsuits.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{hey! we came over to help you with math homework!}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{really. we figured you needed the help. on such a hot day.}
<A>__{stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels beside her. she leans over to linda and speaks confidentially.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i think they're both virgins.}
<A>__{stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i didn't ask for any help. did you, linda?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{well, that's exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi.}
<C>__{stacy}
