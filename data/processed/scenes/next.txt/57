<A>__{cris throws open the bathroom door. liz is still there, in the dark, facing the open window. seeing the expression on his face, she darts for the window. this time, cris doesn't move.}

<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{liz, please, i love you.}
<A>__{she hesitates.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{let me talk to you for one minute. i won't hurt you, i promise.}
<A>__{she turns around, trembling.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{cris, i know you don't mean to hurt people. but you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{the man i killed was there to rob the store. he was going to panic and shoot five innocent people.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{how do you know this?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{because i saw them die.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{like yesterday, with the car?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you were afraid something bad might happen so you...}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{not "might"! those people died! they just hadn't died yet.}
<A>__{his certainty is almost convincing.}

<C>__{cris}
<D>__{once.}
<A>__{the trauma replays on his face.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{that's why i don't go out much. so i won't be there to see.}
