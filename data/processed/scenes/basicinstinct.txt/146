<A>__{it is dark; we can't see clearly. atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly... hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...}

<L>__{interior his bedroom later}
<A>__{atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back... her breasts high... he strains toward her with his body... she holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist... (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls on top of him. a very long beat... we can't see him... her body completely covers him... and then finally he moves... turns her to the side... kisses her.}
