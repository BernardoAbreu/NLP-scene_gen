<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{jacob stoops in front of the apartment door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. it comes back with a key. he inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hello. it's me.}
<L>__{interior sarah's apartment night}
<A>__{the lights are on and the apartment looks comfortable and cozy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello? is anyone home? jed? elie? dad dy's here.}
<A>__{there is still no answer. jacob is surprised. he walks into the living room and then the kitchen. no one is around. he walks into his old bedroom and then the boys' room. he is surprised to hear footsteps coming down the hall. he turns around and calls out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sarah, is that you? i hope you don't mind. i needed to come home.}
<A>__{jacob is startled to see jezzie enter the room. she does not seem to be her usual self. she seems larger, more imposing.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{hello, jake. i knew you'd come here in the end.}
<A>__{jacob is nervous.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where's sarah? where are the boys?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{sit down, jake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{sit down!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no! what's going on? where's my family?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{it's over, jake. it's all over.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where have they gone?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.}
<A>__{jezzie stares at jacob with a frightening, powerful glare. her lips snarl. her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is not a nervous habit but a conscious act. jacob's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. his legs are shaking.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{jezzie smiles at him. her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from her mouth beyond human extension. jacob recoils.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(whispering to himself)}
<D>__{this isn't happening.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{your capacity for self delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.}
<A>__{jezzie's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is suffering from cramps. jacob watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh god!}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{what's wrong, jake?}
<P>__{(she mocks him)}
<D>__{forget to take your antidote?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{goddamn you!}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(smiling and then laughing)}
<D>__{i loved your chemist, jake. the height of fantasy. and your vision of paradise.}
<P>__{(she laughs with a hu miliating tone)}
<D>__{a most romantic creation. you're quite a dreamer, jake. only it's time to wake up.}
<A>__{jacob's eyes are locked on jezzie. his mouth is wide open. his body is shaking badly. he tries to back away from her but his legs barely move.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{there is nowhere to run, jacob. you're home.}
<A>__{suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. plaster from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the carpet. light bulbs and lamps explode. jacob runs to the door. he pulls it open and screams. he is on the edge of a fiery abyss. jezzie laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. jacob spins around.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{how many times have you asked me that? how many times?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{tell me, damn you!}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(with consummate power)}
<D>__{you know who i am.}
<A>__{suddenly jezzie reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might. it is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. with each yank the horror grows as jezzie literally pulls herself inside out before jacob's eyes. the emerging creature is jezzie transfigured, a demonic presence beyond anything we have seen before. it is black and covered with a thick oozing slime. its head, still recognizable as jezzie, is rodent like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns protruding from its brow. its powerful arms have long spiked claws. its feet are cloven hooves. extending from its back is a long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with devastating force. it throws furniture crashing through the air. a sudden cracking sound emerges from the demon's back. dark forms penetrate the air. jacob is breathless as huge wings unfold and spread out to the living room walls. the sound of their flapping is deafening. the walls shatter from their blows. as they crumble darkness appears on the other side. there are no other rooms. the void envelops them. the inferno emerges in all directions. the demon roars.}
<C>__{demon}
<P>__{(with jezzie's voice)}
<D>__{still love me, jake?}
<P>__{(it laughs and reaches out to him)}
<D>__{come!}
