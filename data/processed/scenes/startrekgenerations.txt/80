<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior guinan's quarters}
<A>__{close on guinan as she looks up, surprised.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{soran? that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.}
<A>__{move to reveal guinan's quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the enterprise. none of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present. the floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric. the lighting is moody and subdued. picard is standing before guinan, who is sitting cross legged on the floor. they talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{do you remember him?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{oh yes. i remember everyone who was on the lakul... every face. even the ones who didn't make it...}
<A>__{guinan stands and begins to move about the room... she's clearly troubled by the memories. she hesitates, looks off into the middle distance for a few moments. picard moves to her.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{guinan. it's important that you tell me what you know. we think soran's developed a weapon... a terrible weapon. it might give him enough power to }
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{soran doesn't care about power or weapons. all he cares about is getting back to the nexus.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what's the "nexus"?}
<A>__{guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic looking alien artifacts... distracting herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{it's a place i've tried very hard to forget...}
<A>__{she makes the decision to plunge ahead.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{that ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space... it's a doorway. it leads to another place... the nexus. it doesn't exist in our universe... and it doesn't play by the same rules either.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i can't remember very much... what it looked like or how long i was there... but i do remember how it felt...}
<A>__{she turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{it was like being inside... joy. as if joy was a real thing that i could wrap around myself. i've never been so content...}
<A>__{a long beat as picard absorbs her words.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but then you were beamed away...}
<A>__{guinan shows a rare burst of anger.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i was pulled away. i didn't want to leave; none of us did. i felt like i'd left a part of myself behind. all i could think about was getting back... i didn't care what i had to do.}
<A>__{guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{it took a long time, but eventually i learned to live with it. and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i knew things about people... about events...about time...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{your "sixth sense"... i've always wondered where it came from...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what about soran?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{soran may still be obsessed with getting back. and if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but why destroy a star...?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thank you, guinan.}
<A>__{he heads for the door.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{let someone else do it, jean luc.}
<A>__{picard stops, looks at her.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{let them send another starship. don't get near the ribbon. if you go into that nexus, you're not going to care about soran or the enterprise or me. all you're going to care about is how it feels to be there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you're never going to come back.}
<A>__{picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her eyes... and carefully backs away and exits.}
