<L>__{interior japanese planners office day}
<A>__{the courier places the pictures onto the table in front of yamamoto, genda, and the other japanese officers.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{look at the ships all grouped. perfect targets!}
<C>__{japanese officer}
<D>__{and the planes! they are what is that american expression? sitting geese?}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{sitting ducks.}
<C>__{japanese officer}
<D>__{how can they be so foolish?}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{they think no one would be stupid enough to attack them at pearl harbor.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{or perhaps they think no one is capable. look at this...}
<A>__{he moves to a diagram displayed on the wall a simple display showing water depth and ship displacement.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{pearl harbor's depth of only forty feet makes them feel safe. a torpedo dropped from an airplane plunges to one hundred feet before it can level off. that is a conventional torpedo. but we have been experimenting.}
<A>__{from a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden fins, attached to a circular metallic band.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{wooden fins. we are testing them tomorrow.}
