<L>__{interior closet gaskell house}
<A>__{grady and james leer stand in the doorway. just below the photograph of marilyn and joe hanging next to a pin striped jersey bearing the number 5 is a short black satin jacket trimmed with an ermine collar.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{is that really it?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that's really it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{the one she wore on her wedding day?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so i'm told.}
<A>__{james, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments, stands speechless.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{james swallows, then' goes to the jacket. carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{they're glass. the buttons.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{like the lady herself.}
<A>__{grady says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a bit, but james nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the jacket, as if marilyn herself were inside it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{she was small. most people don't know that. the shoulders are small.}
<P>__{(touching the satin)}
<D>__{it looks so perfect. i bet it's the only time she wore it. that day. she must've felt so ...happy.}
<A>__{grady studies james as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must've cost dr. gaskell a lot.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're really good friends with the chancellor, aren't you?}
<A>__{grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but james' face remains unchanged, consumed with the jacket.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{pretty good. i'm friends with dr. gaskell, too.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{a door slams downstairs and grady and james jump. the click of a woman's high heels sends grady to the bedroom window, where he watches sara slide into a white citroen ds23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{we, better skedaddle. close that closet james? you ail right?}
<A>__{james is slumped on the gaskell's white linen bed, knapsack between his knees, head in hands.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm sorry. professor tripp. maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks...really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe i'm just a little sad.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{maybe. i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?}
<P>__{(off grady's look)}
<D>__{hannah mentioned something about it. about a note.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes. well. it's complicated, james. i think we should go now.}
<A>__{without thinking, grady flicks out the bedroom light, leaving james leer in the dark for the second time today. james just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.}
