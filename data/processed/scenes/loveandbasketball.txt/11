<A>__{monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats on, her face dry. she glances up at the clock. twenty seconds left in the fourth quarter. her team's up by six. her teammates dribble out the clock. the buzzer sounds and they dance across the floor. monica looks up in the stands.}

<A>__{camille, now forty three, stands at the stove stirring a pot of gumbo. lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding a handful of plates and silverware.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.}
<C>__{lena}
<D>__{but you use potato?}
<A>__{camille nods as they cross into:}
<L>__{interior dining room continuous}
<A>__{at the table, monica is in mid conversation with her dad. camille and lena start setting the table.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{dad, you have to talk to coach for me.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{and what am i supposed to say to the man?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you lost your head.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i was just showing emotion.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{so that means it's alright for you to act like that?}
<C>__{lena}
<P>__{(to monica)}
<D>__{what'd you do?}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i don't know why i keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i won't. i'm a lesbian.}

<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i know. but chances are...}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{chances are there's still a chance.}
<A>__{nathan nods. she can always soften her dad, but not her mom.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{if you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself. you're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head. i mean, why walk around with your hair looking like "whodunit"...?}
<A>__{as her mom nags on, monica looks out the window. outside, quincy and a girl lean against a car parked at the curb, slobbing each other down. just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk. he is also the brother who was watching monica's game from the gym doorway. monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...}
