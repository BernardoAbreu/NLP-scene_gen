<L>__{interior hannibal chew's shop night}
<A>__{chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled eyes are shrewd and chinese, but the rest of him looks like a charles dickens invention. he's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand. after a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent smile.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{well, you're right. this little honey has a couple of defective cones.}
<A>__{he snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client. sebastian's face is almost young, but something has gone too far, too fast. premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co ordination slow. the house may be dark but there's a light on in it. se bastian is a closet genius.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{you're a regular perfectionist, sebastian.}
<A>__{sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic mr. chew.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it's gotta be right for my customer.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{your customer, eh?}
<A>__{chew snickers and beckons. sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door. there's a moth eaten full length fur coat hanging by it. chew tugs it on and they go through. the big door slams shut behind them.}
