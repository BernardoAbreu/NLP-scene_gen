<L>__{interior solitary wing clyde's cell night}
<A>__{two doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door. the outer slides aside, reveals nick outside the bars. inside stands a shadow, waiting: clyde.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you're up early. trouble sleeping?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it was a good bluff. but you're done. fucking with my head. scaring my family half to death. done.}
<A>__{clyde moves closer to the bars, into the light.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{amazing, isn't it? how primal that is. that pull? what a man is capable of when it comes to his family?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you strip away all the polite shit, that's what we're really about.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i hope you never face what it is to lose them, nick. it's like dying yourself. there's nothing worse.}
<A>__{that could play as a threat, of course but it's not. it's genuine. and pained. and sincere. and nick knows it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{good night, ben.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{good night, nick.}
<A>__{and then the moment's gone and the mocking clyde returns:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{is it casual friday?}
<P>__{(off nick's look)}
<D>__{i've never seen you not wear a tie.}
<A>__{and that says volumes: clyde's totally aware of what they've been up to and is tickled by it. the outer door grinds shut...}
