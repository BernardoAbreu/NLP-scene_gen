<LOC>__{INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{A run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old- fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews: normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored.}
<CHAR>__{RAV ZINGESSER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And why did the Holy One -- blessed be He -- do this? Why did he ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved?}
<ACTION>__{Two boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose) and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....}
<DIAL>__{12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Isaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael was his son, too. 12-YEAR-OLD AVI The only son he loved. 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Oh, they only kill them when they love them...? 12-YEAR-OLD STUART}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(up front; answering Zingesser)}
<DIAL>__{It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of his devotion to God. 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY It's not about Abraham's faith. It's about God's power. God says, "You know how powerful I am? I can make you do anything I want, no matter how stupid. Even kill your own son. Because I'm everything, you're nothing."}
<ACTION>__{TITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. He hates them for their indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's ass-kissing.}
<CHAR>__{RAV ZINGESSER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions? 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....}
<CHAR>__{AVI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill Isaac. He provides the ram so that -- 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Personally, I think that's a lie. I think he did kill him.}
<CHAR>__{RAV ZINGESSER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You think?! Based on what? 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.}
<CHAR>__{RAV ZINGESSER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No one follows that midrash. 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....}

All the Jews are good at is being afraid. And being sacrificed.}
<ACTION>__{Oooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one.}
<DIAL>__{12-YEAR-OLD STUART Don't you believe in God? 12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I'm the only one here who does believe. You say he's mysterious, yet merciful. I see him for the power- drunk madman He is. And we're supposed to worship such a Deity?? I say Never! I say...fight him. I say --}

<LOC>__{EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher, blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station. He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....}
<LOC>__{INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a YARMULKE. Danny grown up? PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is being watched. REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a "SUEDE-HEAD" (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric). SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples, dandruff, ingrown facial hair... He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede- head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede- head presses into the boy's knees. The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African- American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands at once what is going on. Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns to his paper. Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the boy's shoe. SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOOR The wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free. The boy still hasn't looked up. SUEDE-HEAD & THE JEWISH BOY swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head forces the boy into ever more contorted postures, increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. And the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he keeps highlighting relevant passages. The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up, wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head. The doors open, he gets off.}
<LOC>__{INT. STATION -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Looking up a long escalator, the Jewish boy riding down toward us. Suede-head arrives on the run at the top, races down a flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal slope.... Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the escalator. The boy rides inexorably down. At the bottom, he tries to go around Suede-head who blocks this way, then another, driving him into a corner. The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to face his tormentor. Their eyes meet for the first time. He is actually bigger than Suede-head, but not nearly as strong. He won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no longer deny. There is even an odd relief that disgusts Suede-head more than all the rest.}
<DIAL>__{SUEDE-HEAD Fucking kike.}
<ACTION>__{He slaps him in the face. He stumbles backward. As Suede- head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front of him. Suede-head punches the books straight into his face. The boy falls, curls into a fetal position. Suede-head kicks him....}
<DIAL>__{SUEDE-HEAD Get up.... Get the fuck up....}
<ACTION>__{He won't budge. Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he hears VOICES approaching. He runs back up the stairs to the train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our protagonist. This is Danny grown up.}
