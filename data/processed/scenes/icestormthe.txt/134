<L>__{interior halford foyer. night}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{oh, dot!}
<A>__{elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at dot halford, who looks surprised. hood slides in behind his wife. dot drops the keys into the bowl. slow motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall in with a thunderous crash.}
<L>__{interior halford living room. cont'd}
<A>__{the room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and various groupings. elena slips into a side room. benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other than george clair.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{benjie!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{clair, george clair! what the hell brings you to new canaan?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, it's the funniest thing. i've been talking to some investors a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me about a scheme to manufacture a new styrofoam packaging. little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. miraculous. anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, jim williams. how about that!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, hey, isn't that a one in a million coincidence. a real dreamer, jim williams, eh?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{darned right. look here, benj, whaddya make of this sequel to the godfather? you think it's gonna work?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't see how. i think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. no, trust me disaster pics. and air hockey.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, good.}
<A>__{benjamin catches a glimpse of janey, voluptuously attired, across the room.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah, see you bright and early monday am.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{say, where's the wife?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(winking as he goes)}
<D>__{in rhode island with the folks. i'm a free agent tonight.}
<A>__{at this, they both notice elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room. clair gives ben a sideways glance, then moves on. ben makes straight for janey, who pretends to be preoccupied with a plant.}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{oh jeez, benjie. well, here you are.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{damn right, but where the hell were you?}
<C>__{janey}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(whispering, but too loudly)}
<D>__{don't bullshit me around, janey. jesus christ, i waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and and what's all that about? what the hell happened?}
<A>__{janey takes a sip of her drink.}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{a prior engagement overcame me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{listen, benjamin hood. i have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. one or two, you know, good natured encounters, that doesn't mean i'm... i'm not just some toy for you. when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party, i just did them, that's all, because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{jimmy? jimmy? i don't know how to take this. and what do you mean, jimmy? i thought you said you and your husband }
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{how you take it isn't all that interesting to me, benjamin. i'm sorry }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i just can't believe you could be so }
<A>__{stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and wander off. the air is filled with talk of watergate, billie jean king, the oil crisis, the mets. benjamin goes over to the couch, where dave gorman is chatting up an attractive younger woman.}
<C>__{gorman}
<P>__{(lighting up a joint)}
<D>__{welcome to the monkey house has been a seminal influence on me hey benjamin give it a try? this stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(waving it away)}
<D>__{thanks for the advice dave.}
<A>__{but then, benjamin changes his mind.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{uh, well, what the hey...}
<A>__{taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his lungs.}
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{good shit.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{sure is good shit. it's opiated. i had it in my chamber for a while. i was smoking this other }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's what?}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{don't fret, benjie, it's }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{darn it, dave.}
<A>__{he rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's conversations.}
<C>__{jack moellering}
<D>__{take california. they've got their own airline in state that's not subject to the fare controls. compare sacramento to l.a. on the controlled airlines and you'll see what friedman is saying supply and demand, less restriction.}
<A>__{benjamin walks over to a window. the outdoor lamps illuminate a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet.}
