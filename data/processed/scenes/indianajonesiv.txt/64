<A>__{the pirates' hidden fortress. an enormous, underground cavern. hndreds of burning torches cast a devilish glow. the grey rocks of the cavern walls stretch upward. filled with countless, tiny caves. various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are scattered throughout the cavern. there are several other pirates here. armed. waiting for the return of the pirate ship. the river boat and pirate ship enter the cave. the rushing waterfall thrashes behind them. the battered and bruised river boat comes to a rough stop. screeching along a far wall. the pirate ship sails to a smooth stop in the middle of the cavern. armed with guns, knives and swords, the pirates hurriedly surround the intruding river boat. they take betsy, scraggy and the crew members captive. kezure leaps to the pirate ship's deck and quickly unties clare. indiana attempts to follow. he pauses. quickly grabbing a few sticks of dynamite from the pirate ship deck. kezure begins to lead clare off of the ship. his sword at her throat. indiana calls out.}

<D>__{good. we will all die.}
<A>__{a standoff. indy didn't expect this. he is suddenly frightened. puzzled. betsy, scraggy and clare stare at indy. waiting for his next move...as the dynamite fuse slowly burns. getting closer...closer...to the tnt. kezure seems calm. perfectly willing to die. indy gets another idea. he blurts it out to kezure.}

<D>__{we can take you to the lost city of sun wu kung!}
