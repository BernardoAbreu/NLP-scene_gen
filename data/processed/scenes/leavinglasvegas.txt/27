<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey ben. there were a couple of guys looking for you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what did they look like?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{suits. i didn't tell them anything. you know anything about gears?}
<A>__{ben takes a look. the gear mechanism is all bent out of shape. he bends down to have a look. it is clear from the way he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his hands. he doesn't try to force anything but he moves the chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how'd this happen?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.}

<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{how much, do you think?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't know. i will find out though.}
<A>__{ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. he looks back and brad is sitting still by the bike, looking totally dejected. this really seems to upset ben.}
