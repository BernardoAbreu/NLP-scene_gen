<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior small tunnel}
<A>__{pk crawls after doc, making his way through the small tunnel on his stomach.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you know the pyramids are nothing more than man's attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had the cave. it is the ultimate safe resting place. the first place man could lay down and have a good night's sleep without worrying about waking up as something's supper.}
<A>__{doc stops crawling. so does pk. a dripping can be heard.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you hear that? there is something waiting for us.}
<A>__{doc starts moving quicker.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{let's hope it's not hungry.}
<A>__{doc squeezes out of the small space. pk joins him in a slightly larger tunnel, the same size as the first one stoop height.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{better, ja?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what's that smell?}
<A>__{all of a sudden there is a rustling noise.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{doc recognizes the sound. he pounces on pk, knocking him to the floor and covering him with his body. not a moment too soon. for a thousand bats fill the tunnel flying through. pk's pov bats flying wildly through the flashlight beams. in a blur, the bats are gone, disappeared into another tunnel entrance to the left.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{doc an pk rise slowly. the silence of the cave is punctuated by the dripping.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{maybe it's stopped raining.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the bats didn't come from a shoebox, mr. know it all.}
<A>__{doc heads off.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{sometimes i think maybe sending you off to that fancy shmancy school was not such a good idea.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{it was your idea. your'e the one who pushed for me to go.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ja. but who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of your brain.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{which part is that?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the one where is all the questions. the curiosity center. look.}
<A>__{ahead in the tunnel is a luminous glow, filling an entrance.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{did i tell you?}
<A>__{doc and pk hurry on. their pov tunnel opening as they come to a tunnel opening: a large cave, perhaps}
