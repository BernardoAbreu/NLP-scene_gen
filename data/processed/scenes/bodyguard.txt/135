<L>__{exterior balcony night}
<A>__{frank looks out at the ocean. the breeze washes over his face. a huge brightly lit yacht is sailing by, close to shore. frank looks at it reflectively. he senses another presence and looks to his right. rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. the bright moon light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. she is wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied. but tonight it hasn't come together. it doesn't work. she holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing. this is the only time we've seen her smoke.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{farmer... nothing that's happened between us matters... i understand now... you're going to have to believe me, because i'm not going to beg.}
<A>__{she takes a long drag on her cigarette.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it wasn't what he said... it was the way he said it... he was so...}
<A>__{her voice cracks. she stops and tries to compose herself.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i need you... i'm afraid... and i hate it. i hate my fear...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{please protect me... protect fletcher... if anything happened to him...}
<A>__{frank looks at her. tears are destroying her elaborate stage makeup. she wipes them away with her hand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i can't protect you like this. it's impossible. the odds are on his side.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will do whatever you say.}
<A>__{this is the first time frank has ever heard rachel say that. he studies her, then looks out at the ocean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i want to take you away for a while.}
<A>__{rachel nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{somewhere people don't know about.}
<A>__{she nods again, agreeing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no spector or devaney or tony.}
<A>__{he looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation. there is none.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if you cross me up this time, i will kill you myself.}
<A>__{rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.}
