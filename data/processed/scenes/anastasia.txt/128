<L>__{interior tatiana's house day}
<A>__{anya sits, looking a bit vacant as two overly french jewelers, pierre & andre, fit anya for her royal crown. tatiana sits across from anya and can't help but notice that anya looks miserable as sophie bustles about.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{a grand ball for the princess. how very exciting. so much to do, so little time...}
<C>__{tatiana}
<P>__{(slightly annoyed)}
<D>__{do it somewhere else, please. quietly.}
<A>__{the slight is lost on sophie who bustles out talking to herself.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{caterers ... invitations ... saber dancers! we must have saber dancers!}
<A>__{"rulers of russia" (comic reprise) sophie sings as comic reprise of 'rulers of russia" pierre and andre argue as they fit anya for the crown.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{her head it is ... how you say?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{beeg. zat is how you say it. beeg.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{and the crown she is ... how you say?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{small! zat is "how you say" it! don't be so french, pierre wit the "how you say" all za time zat is really annoying.}
<A>__{as they discuss this, anya wanders away from them, the crown still slightly askew on her head. tatiana follows her.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{you are going to make a beautiful princess.}
<A>__{but anya simply nods. tatiana turns her towards a full length mirror, then straightens the crown as they look at their reflections.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{lovely...}
<P>__{(no reaction)}
<D>__{what troubles you, child?}
<A>__{but before anya can answer, vladimir leans into the room.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{madame, your... eh... guest has arrived.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<P>__{(knowing)}
<D>__{thank you, vladimir.,}
<A>__{tatiana leaves and vladimir looks at anya. anya, angry at him, turns away.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{anya... anastasia... i'm sorry ... we didn't mean to hurt you ...}
<A>__{anya still won't look at him.}
