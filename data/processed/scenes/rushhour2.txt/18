<A>__{twenty men in silk robes lie in reclining chairs, women massaging their feet and hands. there are big screen tv's showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the background. lee and carter sit in the quiet room dressed in matching purple robes. lee wears slippers, carter wears his high tops. carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same time. a woman walks over and hands them each a drink.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{now i'm on vacation. i knew you'd come through, lee.}
<A>__{lee doesn't respond. lee is staring at someone on the far side of the room. a man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality.}
<C>__{carter }

<D>__{i'm a dangerous man. you're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm calling for back up!}
<A>__{lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits. carter looks at ricky tan sitting quietly in his chair with his laptop computer on his knees. carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{ricky tan, i've been looking all over for you. get up.}

<D>__{i'm lee's new muscle, his right arm and don't let the robe fool you. this is the only color they had left. now get up!}
<A>__{tan laughs, goes back to his laptop. carter grabs the laptop from ricky and throws it across the room shattering it against the wall. ricky glances at his men who are seated around the room waiting to move.}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{i told you to get on your feet!}
<A>__{having heard the commotion, lee arrives by carter's side, breathless, as tan looks up, surprised.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{lee, i've missed you, brother.}
<P>__{(getting up, giving lee a hug)}
<D>__{i heard about the two americans, i'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you must come with me for questioning.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{let's go. i've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{i don't think so...}
<A>__{a nod of ricky tan's head, and ten large men in robes and towels spring out of reclining chairs menacingly facing lee and carter. a beat...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i'd like to pay you for that laptop.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{it's no problem. but i must excuse myself, inspector.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{that's chief inspector, he got promoted.}
<A>__{tan bows to lee and carter.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{congratulations. and good day.}
<A>__{as tan starts to exit, lee and carter move to intercept him. but they are blocked by tan's men. lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off. the man covers his naked body. lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object. carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men flying back grabbing a towel of one of them.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(ref: his privates)}
<D>__{damn! no wonder you're pissed off.}
<A>__{carter uses the towel like lee did to block and trap one of the men's punches. in the middle of fighting, lee is suddenly exposed he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind two men throwing him out the front door. carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over their shoulders.}
