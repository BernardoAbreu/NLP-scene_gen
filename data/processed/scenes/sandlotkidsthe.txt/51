<A>__{two thieves in ski masks. suddenly, a heated wind strips their masks. two elephantine feet come down on their faces. they scream.}
<C>__{squints }
<D>__{and he did. and he liked it.}
<C>__{another thief}
<A>__{suddenly enveloped by a shadow. he's dragged into darkness... he screams.}
<B>__{two other thieves}
<A>__{load their van and take off. they skid. crunch! the van caves in. the thieves are dragged out, blathering in horror. from high above mertle's acres the beast moves like a murderous phantom. we hear roaring, and primordial bloodlust.}
<B>__{various other theives}
<A>__{are tossed hither and yon... mixed in with fake flamingoes, and a flying plastic cow.}
