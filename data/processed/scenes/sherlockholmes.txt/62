<A>__{holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of irene through a street fair, which is being assembled. holmes picks up the pace. he snatches a hat from a one eyed old beggar with his hand out. he drops a coin in his hand, then another coin and snatches the beggar's eye patch too. he runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews it to blacken his teeth. he pauses to singe the sleeve of watson's coat on a fairground fire breather's flames, runs on.}
