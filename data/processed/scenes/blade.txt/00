<A>__{it's 1967, the summer of love and boom! entry doors swing open as paramedics wheel in a female bleeder, vanessa (20s, black, nine months pregnant). she's deathly pale, spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat a shock trauma team swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her arm }
