<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior camp}
<A>__{a ruin. one half of it burnt almost to the ground. macready wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, from his shoulders to the floor. he walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches of fire with an extinguisher. it is futile. he gives up.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior pub area}
<A>__{mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of the camp, exposed to the outside. the storm has settled considerably.}
<B>__{close on macready}
<A>__{lighting a cigar. his hands are heavily wrapped. he pours himself a drink. a puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame and whirls a startled macready around. it is childs. white and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{did you kill it?}
<A>__{he looks as weak as macready. a beat.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{what do you mean "you think so?"}
<A>__{both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{yeah. i got it.}
<P>__{(refers to childs' condition)}
<D>__{pretty mean frostbite.}
<A>__{childs steps back, keeping his distance. he indicates his puffy white hand.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{it'll turn black again soon enough. then i guess i will be losing the whole thing...}
<P>__{(refers to feet)}
<D>__{...think my toes are already gone.}
<A>__{macready, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits down behind a gaming table. there is a chess set and several decks of cards. the two men continue to eye each other.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{so you're the only one who made it.}
<A>__{macready begins setting up a non electronic chessboard.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{not the only one.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{the fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{neither will we.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{then we'll never make it.}
<A>__{macready puffs on his cigar. he reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't make it.}
<C>__{childs}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{if we've got any surprises for each other we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you play chess?}
<A>__{they regard each other for a moment. childs painfully sits down across from macready.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{i guess i will be learning.}
<A>__{macready grins and hands the bottle to childs. childs smiles back and takes a healthy swig.}
