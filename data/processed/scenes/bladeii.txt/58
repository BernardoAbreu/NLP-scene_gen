<A>__{a high ceilinged ballroom packed with swaying bodies. retrofitted into a trance dance hall. off to the sides, people are being pierced, tattooed, ritually scarred. silver trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the writhing crowd. everyone looks suspicious. an elaborate s&m stage show is under way. joel peter witkin channeled by julie taymor. a she vampire hangs from the ceiling, her body supported by steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh. three pvc clad spindly figures minister to her.}

<A>__{the bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd.}
<B>__{on blade}
<A>__{drifting through the press of flesh. feral faces flash by us, distorted by the stroboscopic lights. a she vampire latches onto him. he shoves her aside, keeps scanning faces. it takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you reading me, scud?}
