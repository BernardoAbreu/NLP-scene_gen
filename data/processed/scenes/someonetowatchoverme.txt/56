<A>__{as mike pads quietly across the marble floors in the quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty living room. it is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as though to estimate their height. moving inward, his eyes fall on a book rack, and he crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading material. they're all art books, the big, thick kind. a renoir, because of a nude figure on the cover, catches his eye. but as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through he hears voices. claire's and neil's; her tone is agitated.}
