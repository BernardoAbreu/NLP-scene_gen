<L>__{119: exterior landscape. berlin's house. dawn.}
<A>__{a little house in winter meadows. kind of pretty now it's pain ted. just the first tint of pink on its roof. the carol dissol ves into birdsong. here comes the sun for a fine christmas day.}
<L>__{120: exterior veranda. house. dawn.}
<A>__{all new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times. a barbecue still in polythene wraps. price tag and unconnected gas pipe shift gently in the breeze. a brand now swinging seat. berlin sits in it with shock wearing on. expressionless of sor row. though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there is. sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red. silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life.}
