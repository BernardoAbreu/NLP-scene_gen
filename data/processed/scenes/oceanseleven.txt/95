<L>__{105 interior high rollers' room night}
<A>__{quiet, elegant, tense. one table is operating only, in the corner, and at it saul, as lyman zerga, furtively peels at the roll of rolaids and slips one in his mouth.}
<D>__{high roller #1 weak stomach, mr. zerga?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i don't believe in weakness. it costs too much. i don't believe in questions, either.}
<A>__{this shuts the high roller up fast. saul looks up from the table, just perceptibly, to spot terry benedict, on his way in, right on schedule. he approaches the pit boss by the entrance.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{eddie. anything for me?}
<C>__{pit boss}
