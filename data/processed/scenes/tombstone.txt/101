<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{wyatt opens the coach door for her. she gets in. it pulls out with a crack of the driver's whip. she and wyatt hold each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance. then:}

<A>__{creek johnson steps up next to him. wyatt looks at him:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings. funny thing but i can't really remember how she looked. i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package. can't put it together for some reason.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{good god, you're really }
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{cards in spades. i'm in love with every second of her life. hell, i will probably love her when i'm dust.}
