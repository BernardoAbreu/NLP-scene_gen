<L>__{interior rose's car evening}
<A>__{rose drives as the sun sinks into the desert landscape.}
<L>__{exterior laughing buddha house night}
<A>__{rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering house. rose steps from the car with an expression of horror. fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. then she sees norah, sitting in the van across the street. headphones on. kitten curled up in her lap. rose marches over but norah doesn't notice her until she raps on the window. norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door and slides out of the van.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<A>__{rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable consequences of the scene before her.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh my god, what have you done?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{how does this happen? huh? how do you burn down a house, norah? jesus fucking christ!}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{jesus rose, calm down.}
<A>__{rose throws her keys at norah. norah turns to shield the kitten. the keys thump her arm. norah eyes her sister. so that's how it's gonna be.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. if you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. so don't try to put all this on me.}
<A>__{norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{this is on you. you did this. you set a fucking house on fire! you.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{oh, go ahead and play the martyr. it's like your favorite thing.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i can't believe i was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit. why don't you take a look at you're own life, huh? you're a real inspiration.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well maybe if i didn't have to take care of everybody in this family.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{fuck you. i'm done being your excuse.}
<A>__{norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from rose, the fire and everything. the kitten clings to her shirt.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh that's great. turn everything to shit and then walk away.}
<A>__{without turning or breaking her stride, norah flips off rose. rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches the firemen hose down the house.}
