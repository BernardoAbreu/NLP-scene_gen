<A>__{jam approaches the stadium, passing the matmoks, walking straight up to mrs. bruce. her back is to him. he taps her on the shoulder. she turns. her jaw drops. it escaped again! and what an ugly tee shirt.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i'm gonna ask you nicely first. mom, can i have my drumsticks back?}
<A>__{taken aback by his confidence, mrs. bruce grabs his ear and tries to pull him away. he won't budge.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{again, can i have my drumsticks?}
<A>__{a bunch of idiots walk by with big transistor radios. one of them holds a mr. microphone and heckles the matmoks.}

<D>__{hey, i'm on the radio! hi, good lookin'. we'll be back to pick you up later!}
<A>__{mrs. bruce yells at jam through her bullhorn.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man. you are in a world of...}
<A>__{jam yanks the mr. microphone from the lead idiot and screams at his mother, his voice amplified on the transistors. everyone stares.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i know, mom, i've been in trouble for about twelve hours now! hellooooo!?}
<A>__{the other matmoks turn to look as jam climbs onto a trash receptacle and shouts down at his mother, his face slowly turning purple.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at st. bernard's boarding school, remember?! i'm gonna be outta your hair till i'm a legal adult, remember?! that way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! all is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! then, you can spend your days in guilt free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! that way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! and that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. cause if you did, you'd realize what a lousy, goddamn, shitty ass, parent you are!!!}
<A>__{the crowd of kiss fans applaud jam's rant. mrs. bruce is utterly winded from the assault.}

<D>__{jeremiah... what's gotten into you?}
<C>__{jam}

<D>__{i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! lord have mercy!!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers. jam jumps down and hands the mr. microphone back to the lead idiot. he turns to his mom.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{for the last time, mom. let me have my fucking drumsticks. please.}
<A>__{mrs. bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and hands them to him. he spins them like pistols, then stuffs them into his socks and walks away.}
<C>__{simple plan}
