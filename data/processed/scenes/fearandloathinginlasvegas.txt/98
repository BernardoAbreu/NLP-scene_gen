<A>__{gonzo hustles the maid to the door.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{you'd pay me for that?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you're damn right. but the first time you say anything about this, to anybody you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. what's your name?}

<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{oh, and don't bother to make up the room. that way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{whatever you say, gentlemen. i can't tell you how sorry i am about what happened...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{don't worry, it's all over now. thank god for the decent people.}
<A>__{she smiles, repeating to herself "one hand washes the other" as gonzo hangs the do not disturb sign and shuts the door.}
