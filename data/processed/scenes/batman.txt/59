<L>__{0: interior bruce wayne's bedroom morning}
<A>__{the sun is just up, and vicki finds herself alone in bed. a soft, off key baritone voice drifts out of the adjacent bathroom: bruce in the shower, singing "honeysuckle rose." she breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. somehow she's wound up wearing bruce's ribbed formal shirt.}
<L>__{interior bathroom a moment later morning}
<A>__{bruce in his opulent deco shower stall, still singing to himself. vicki sneaks up behind him, opens the door. he instantly stops singing as if he's been hit by a brick.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i didn't mean to scare you. i just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing.}
<A>__{she smiles, teasing him. he doesn't respond. he acts as if she's caught him doing something shameful exposed him.}
<C>__{vicki }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"don't buy sugar you just have to touch my cup." come on. "you're my sugar "}
<P>__{(no response from bruce)}
<D>__{bruce, you are such a case.}
<A>__{bruce seems somehow unable to sing along. but be quickly recovers his composure and forces a crooked, almost childish smile.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i don't sing very well.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. and i know what it is. now you'll have to kill me.}
<A>__{he kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a towel. his body is one big mass of bruises and abrasions.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{poor thing. you should stay off that horse.}
