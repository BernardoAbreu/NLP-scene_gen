<A>__{edgar and silus stalk each other in the steam room. edgar launches himself towards silus, but silus is now too quick. silus slams edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of edgar's face left on the pipe. stunned edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, silus rising now, he has him. again, silus slams edgar's head into another pipe. and now silus has edgar's throat in his fist and the look on silus' face tells edgar he will not escape. we see edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying. steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. then behind silus, edgar can make something out. an old, corroded tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. there are a series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for sterilizing bottles. with a last effort edgar propels silus backwards onto one of the shafts, making silus grimace and clutch his back where he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. the piercing has operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the wound on silus' back. cut to silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it. and now edgar above him. he removes one of the sterilizer shafts from the bracket that holds it. he clutches a lever on the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end of the shaft. edgar moves slowly towards silus. we see silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's stopped by more pipes behind him. nowhere to go. and edgar ready to pounce. he does, driving the shaft towards silus' head. silus manages to raise one hand to edgar's wrist to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. now the shaft is right in silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back at silus. edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of the shaft, ready to get some steam going.}

<A>__{cut to edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. the steaming end of the shaft right in silus' face. then edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the last time. the blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the shaft drifts into our frame. cut to silus. his face is not scolded. cut back to edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. then he goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff of steam. and then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam still rising from the sharp end of it. cut to edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.}
