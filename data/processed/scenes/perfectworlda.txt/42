<L>__{exterior perry yard dawn}
<A>__{cummings races from behind the house with the shotgun, levels it and fires a blast... a nearby station wagon window shatters. rising from their cover position, its owners look at cummings with disgust.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{nice shootin', fred.}
<L>__{interior red's office day}
<A>__{garnett, still in the same clothes, rests the phone receiver in his ear while he shuffles through the files before him. red's deputy and boy friday, tom adler, 40, lank, thinning hair, with a face as soft as red's is hard, warms up red's coffee with a jolt from the chief's favorite plaid thermos.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes, johnny, i do understand that...}
<A>__{the jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues as red's eyes squint to read the files. insert files the first is jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner. there are several pages in the file, but red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before turning to... insert second file it's butch's and again red's fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo of butch at the top of the page. red's face a hint of recognition. the jabbering continues... closeup photo of butch a little younger than now. a younger con with the grim facade of a man facing hard time.}
<B>__{red}
<A>__{keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the phone conversa tion he's "not having".}
<C>__{phone voice }
<D>__{red? red, you there?}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{red?....}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(to adler)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{he's talkin' to ya'.}
<C>__{phone voice }
<D>__{have you heard a word i've said?!}
<A>__{red comes to...}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah, johnny. jus' thinkin' is all....}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(another whisper)}
<D>__{press has been waiting almost an hour, red.}
<A>__{red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her in... sally gerber, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way, with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind her. she's nervous as hell but trying to hide it. red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah.... clear as a bell... mi' sabe.}
<A>__{red hangs up the phone, takes a draw on the coffee mug and looks again at the file. he seems lost in time.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{what'd he say?}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{the guvner', red.}
<A>__{red closes the file.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{reminded me it's an election year.}
<A>__{red turns his attention to sally.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you drink before noon?}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{uh... no.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{good. last one i had was on a liquid diet.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{last what?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{secretary.}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{penny munroe.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i believe you have me confused. i'm here from huntsville. assigned by governor connally.}
<A>__{red is confused. he turns a blank expression to adler.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{adler... what is this?}
<A>__{adler searches the messy desk for something.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{rings a bell, red. believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{who sent?...}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{... guvner', red.}
<A>__{adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to red.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{... here it is.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(introducing)}
<D>__{uh, i'm sally gerber. criminologist with the state prison system.}
<A>__{sally offers her hand. red, perusing the telex, ignores but adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{tom adler. deputy. state police... system.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's a relatively new procedure but i was assigned by governor connally...}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(reading from telex)}
<D>__{... 'to work with state law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the state police.' it don't say nuthin' about...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{... it includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations.}
<A>__{the office phone buzzes. adler picks it up.}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{on our way, marge.}
<A>__{adler hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{gettin' antsy, red. you scheduled it.}
<A>__{adler hangs up, grabs red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over. red puts down the telex, stares at sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{the idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self same traps as an aide to apprehension.}
<A>__{adler stares at sally then turns to red with a "never heard the like" look of amazement on his face. red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door. but, before he exits...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{in the first place, miss gerber.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{sally, please.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{in the first place, sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' it's a manhunt. fancy words in a circle don't help much.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{and what does?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{a nose like a blue tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee.}
<A>__{and with that he's out the door.}
