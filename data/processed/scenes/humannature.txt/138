<A>__{nathan paces in front of puff's lucite case. puff watches suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled. the lights are off. but there is a green glow from a couple of exit signs.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i don't get it. i don't get it. i don't get it. how could i find myself in this mess? this is a mess. this is not a situation i understand. this is a mess. how do i extricate myself from this mess? is my girlfriend a man? i don't understand. this is not part of any plan. she deceived me. she has hair.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but am i being fair? so what if she has hair? who am i to judge? i have hair.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i'm supposed to have hair. i am a man. men are supposed to have hair.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but poor lila. think of what she's had to go through. the courage she's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature. i should love her all the more. i should love every hair on her body. i mean, she doesn't mind that i have a mortifyingly small...}
<A>__{the lights flick on. nathan turns with a start. it's gabrielle. she's in an overcoat. she gasps.}

<D>__{oh, doctor. i did not know. i'm sorry to disturb you. i just came for some papers i left.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{gabrielle. no, i'm sorry if i startled you. i came to think.}

<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{no. i just got distracted. i'm so sorry.}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i was in my p.j.'s when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over.}
<P>__{(opens overcoat to reveal lingerie)}
<D>__{see? i rushed right out of the house. i must look a mess. i'm so embarrassed.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(taken)}
<D>__{i'm in my p.j.'s, too. funny, huh?}
<A>__{puff is taken also. his eyes are wide.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{coincidence, yes?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and how is our son?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{our...? oh!}
<P>__{(laughs, out of control)}
<D>__{he seems fine. i guess we woke him. the lights and all.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i should turn them off.}
<P>__{(she does)}
<D>__{maybe i sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when i was a little girl.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(a little giddy)}
<D>__{when you were a little french girl?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{oui.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(back in control)}
<D>__{that would be good.}
<A>__{gabrielle kneels by puff's case. puff crawls over, tries to touch her through the lucite. gabrielle sings a french lullaby. it's very sweet. nathan watches her, looks at her thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves when she sings. puff gets drowsy. he curls up on the floor and sleeps.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(quietly to nathan)}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{nathan stares at her, transfixed. she pretends not to notice.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{shall we close up, then?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{maybe we should just sit for a while. it's very peaceful.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's nice, yes. i'm glad i ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. it is two happy coincidences, no?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{yes. happy happy.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yet you look so sad. a great man like you should not be sad.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i'm fine. life is funny, that's all.}
<A>__{gabrielle stands. she stretches languorously, revealing a lot of leg.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i am sleepy.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, gabrielle. it's unprofessional, i know.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{really? i always think myself so ugly. no, not ugly, but plain. a wallflower.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(buying her line)}
<D>__{really? no. not at all. you're a very pretty girl. you should know that. you should be confident.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{thank you so much. merci. it's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{it's true. i wouldn't lie.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{you are sweet.}
<A>__{gabrielle walks slowly by nathan. he inhales deeply, breathing her in. she smiles to herself. he reaches out touches her leg.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(vaguely protesting)}
<D>__{doctor.}
<A>__{she moves into nathan. she presses her thigh against his shoulder. nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{so soft. so smooth.}
<P>__{(back to reality)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just...}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{shh.}
