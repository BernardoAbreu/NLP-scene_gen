<L>__{exterior butch's apartment courtyard day}
<A>__{butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building. once again, everything appears normal the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door nothing appears disturbed. butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. he steps outside the door and listens inside. nothing. butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.}
<L>__{interior butch's apartment day}
<A>__{his apartment hasn't been touched. he cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. obviously, no one is there. butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. with carton in hard, butch surveys the apartment. then he goes to the bedroom. his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat, clean and anonymous. the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "ring magazine" with butch on the cover, and a poster of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo. sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts. putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster. butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. what he sees is a small compact czech m61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.}

<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. then... a toilet flushes. butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. there is someone behind it. like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, butch freezes, not knowing what to do. the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. in his hand is the book "modesty blaise" by peter o'donnell. vincent and butch lock eyes. vincent freezes. butch doesn't move, except to point the m61 in vincent's direction. neither man opens his mouth. then... the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts. that's all the situation needed. butch's finger hits the trigger. muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun. vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously lifting him off his feet, propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger, vincent is annihilated. butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. with the respect it deserves, butch carefully places the m61 back on the kitchen counter. then he exits the apartment, quickly.}
