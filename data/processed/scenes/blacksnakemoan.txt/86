<A>__{the faint echo of rae's fevered panting. she lies on the couch wrapped in a quilt, shivering. her eyes remain closed, her face drenched with sweat. laz has cleaned her facial wounds, using a few band aids. boom! an explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin. rae jolts awake, terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire ball outside the window. she struggles to her feet and listens. a faint sound can be heard through the roar of the flames. beep beep... beep beep... beep beep... beep beep...}
