<L>__{interior large tent everglades camp night }
<A>__{two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent. a rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which susan is preparing for bed. kane, in his shirt sleeves, is in an easy chair, reading. susan is very sullen.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm not going to put up with it.}
<A>__{kane turns to look at her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i mean it.}
<P>__{(she catches a slight}
<D>__{flicker on kane's}
<P>__{face)}
<D>__{oh, i know i always say i mean it, and then i don't or you get me so don't do what i say i'm going to but }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{you're in a tent, darling. you're not at home. and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think }
<P>__{(in a rage)}
<D>__{ if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. you've got no right }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, susan.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, i'm sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i musn't do!}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you're my wife, susan, and }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm not just your wife, i'm a person all by myself or i ought to be. i was once. sometimes you get me to believing i never was.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{we can discuss all this some other time, susan. right now }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i will discuss what's on my mind when i want to. you're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{as far as you're concerned, susan, i've never wanted anything i don't want anything now except what you want.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what you want me to want, you mean. what you've decided i ought to have what you'd want if you were me. but you've never given me anything that }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{susan, i really think }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, i don't mean the things you've given me that don't mean anything to you. what's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? it's only money. it doesn't mean anything. you're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(he has risen)}
<D>__{susan, i want you to stop this. and right now!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, i'm not going to stop it. i'm going to say exactly what i think.}
<P>__{(she screams)}
<D>__{you've never given me anything. you've tried to buy me into giving you something. you're }
<P>__{(a sudden notion)}
<D>__{ it's like you were bribing me! that's what it's been from the first moment i met you. no matter how much it cost you your time, your money that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. tried to bribe them!}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{susan!}
<A>__{she looks at him, with no lessening of her passion.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{you're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, susan.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{whatever i do i do because i love you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{love! you don't love anybody! me or anybody else! you want to be loved that's all you want! i'm charles foster kane. whatever you want just name it and it's yours! only love me! don't expect me to love you }
<A>__{without a word, kane slaps her across the face. they look at each other.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you you hit me.}
<A>__{kane continues to look at her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you'll never have another chance to hit me again.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{never knew till this minute }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{susan, it seems to me }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't tell me you're sorry.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i'm not sorry.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm going to leave you.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{no, you're not.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way. in fact, the camera on kane's face shows the beginning of a startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and unbelievable.}
