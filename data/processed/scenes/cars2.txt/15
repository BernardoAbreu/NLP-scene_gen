<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{mcqueen and sally they hear the commotion inside.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{hey, what's going on over there?}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{the bar sally and mcqueen push through the crowd, see that they're watching francesco on the television.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<P>__{(to sally)}
<D>__{oh, it's that italian formula car. his name is }
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{francesco bernoulli. no wonder there's a crowd.}
<A>__{when sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if italian were her mother's tongue.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{wait, why do you know his name? and don't say it like that. it's three syllables, not ten.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what? he's nice to look at. you know, open wheeled and all.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{what's wrong with fenders? i thought you like my fenders.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{well let me tell you something else there, mr. san francisco }
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{mcqueen could drive circles around you.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{driving in circles is all he can do, no?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{no! i mean yes. i mean he could beat you anywhere, anytime, any track.}
<A>__{on mcqueen he looks at guido who gives a nod over to mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{mel, can we move on? francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation. like a dump truck.}
<A>__{on mcqueen. he doesn't like this at all.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{ha ha! that shows what you know. dump trucks is dumb.}
<A>__{suddenly, mater is yanked from the booth and replaced by mcqueen.}
<C>__{mcqueen }
<D>__{yeah, hi, this is lightning mcqueen. look, i don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{mcqueen! that was your best friend? this is the difference between you and francesco. francesco knows how good he is. he does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{fragile!? he calls francesco fragile? not so fast, mcqueen!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{"not so fast." what is that, your new motto?}
<A>__{francesco goes ballistic in italian. they cut his mic.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{well, this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course. what do you say, lightning mcqueen? we've still got room for one more racer.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{well, i would love to. the only thing is my crew's off for the season so }
<A>__{a sound o.s. mcqueen turns to see fillmore, sarge and luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. ramone backs away, having spray painted "team lightning mcqueen" on it. guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{pit stop.}
<A>__{mcqueen turns back to the phone.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{you know what? they just got back. deal me in, baby. ka chow!}
<A>__{the place erupts in cheers. moments later general excitement as mcqueen exits the phone booth where sally waits. off her look:}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i know, i know. i just got back. but we won't be long and }
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh, no, don't worry about me. i've got enough to do here. mater's going to have a blast though.}
<P>__{(off mcqueen's silence)}
<D>__{you're bringing mater, right? you never bring him to any of your races.}
<A>__{mcqueen turns to the bar where mater privately tries their drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{just let him sit in the pits, give him a headset. c'mon, it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him.}
<A>__{mater arrives.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{your drinks, sir.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i didn't taste it!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{how'd you like to come and see the world with me?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you mean it?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{you got me into this thing. you're coming along. begin montage:}
<A>__{ mcqueen is given a new paint job and headlights by ramone. mater, now sporting a "team mcqueen" emblem, seems psyched as well. an airport departures sign advertises the next flight: tokyo, japan. mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside mcqueen, guido, luigi, fillmore and sarge as the rest of radiator springs watches them board a plane. red bawls. in the jet, later. mcqueen and mater are the only ones awake, watch an insane japanese game show. japan at night. a stylish tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour, scrolling billboards, vending machines and high tech skyscrapers. inside a souvenir shop loaded with mcqueen toys: mater and mcqueen enter. a tourist sees mcqueen and faints. a kabuki theater. team mcqueen watches a methodical dance. mater, dressed in kabuki makeup, arrives. he looks insane. a sumo match two suzuki samurai cars wrestle over a parking space. mater, now in his element, cheers. the montage ends on this high note as we cut to }
