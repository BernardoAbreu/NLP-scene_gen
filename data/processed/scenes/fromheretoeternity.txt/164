<B>__{two shot warden and a lieutenant colonel}
<A>__{they are looking down to camera, which shoots up as if from point of view of prew's body in the sand trap. the dimmed headlights of two jeeps illuminates them. warden is fighting to control his emotion, to remain the professional soldier. the lieutenant colonel is disturbed, but kindly.}

<C>__{lieutenant colonel's voice}
<D>__{seems to be acme sort of poem.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{yes, air.}
<A>__{very softly, so distant that we can only distinguish a word or two now and then, we hear the voices of clark, anderson and prew singing the "re enlistment blues." the plaintive melody continues under the rest of the scene.}
<B>__{medium shot warden and lieutenant colonel}
<C>__{lieutenant colonel}
<D>__{and this. whatever it is.}
<A>__{he holds prew' s bugle mouthpiece up to the light, gives it to warden. warden holds it in his hand, stares at it. under the "re enlistment blues," even softer, farther away, we now hear prew's bugle blowing taps. it continues, with the song, to the end of the scene.}

<D>__{it's the mouthpiece of a bugle.}
<A>__{the lieutenant colonel looks at warden closely.}
