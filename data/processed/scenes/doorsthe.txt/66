<L>__{interior patricia's soho loft that day (rain)}
<A>__{rain, rain, rain... pelting the large windows as we glide to jim fucking journalist 4 (patricia kennealy) madly in the twisted sheets... he gives up, exhausted. the song crystal ship backbeats the scene... he wanders around her place. her place is crammed with books and intellectualabilia, skulls, candles, globes of the world, plants. she puts her glasses back on.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you want to do some more cocaine? it'll loosen you up.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{great! a new thing.}
<A>__{as she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of champagne and a basketful of items all catered by jim. he's at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{wow how old is this?}
<A>__{insert the drawings in the book pertain to witchcraft.}
<C>__{patricia}
<P>__{(snorting)}
<D>__{14th century. i practice the craft.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the craft?}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{i'm a witch}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{a white one.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{wow! you patricia? who would've guessed?}
<A>__{ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and demeanor. she looks back at him, challenging.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{the kennealy's were celtic cheiftains and pre christian shamans when your druid ancestors the morrisons were a minor scottish clan founded by a bastard son of the king of norway.}
<A>__{jim reappraising her. her eye contact is very direct.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{it's a religion, witchcraft. witches are the protectors of the seasons, the harvests, goddesses of the grain. and when crossed, destroyers.}
<A>__{jim waits. something in the feeling of the room has shifted. the sound of her razor chopping coke. he snorts the first time.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you ever try drinking blood?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{it works you know. you drink blood the right time of the moon... they used to dance in the forests naked. i think that's what offended the puritans and led to the burnings. they were a sexual threat to their male order like the bacchae five days a year for dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient greece, the first witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the wine in their blood running hot looking for dionysus... to tear him to pieces isn't that wild?}
<A>__{jim is down on his knees crawling around her. she is crawling back.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(hooked)}
<D>__{where do you get the blood?}
<A>__{patricia laughs.}
