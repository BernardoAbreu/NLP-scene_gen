<A>__{sam is loading the cargo container into the base's maglev launcher. he works with a sense of routine, far away, preoccupied. all of a sudden sam stops. he has the feeling someone is standing behind him. he slowly turns. a girl is standing in the doorway watching him. she is perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. a yellow dress. long, wheat colored hair. freckles. at once beautiful and haunting. sam gets the fright of his life. he flies against the wall. widen to reveal sam and the girl facing off. sam pop eyed and shaking. the girl immobile, arms at her sides, head tilted ever so slightly to one side. the cargo container is sent hurtling through space. a terrific blast. it distracts sam's attention, breaks his stare... and just like that, the girl is gone. sam is just staring at an empty doorway. nothing there. sam is baffled. had to be his imagination. had to be. after a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues working.}
