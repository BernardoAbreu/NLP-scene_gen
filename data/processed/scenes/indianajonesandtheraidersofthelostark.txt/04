<L>__{interior temple inclined passage day}
<A>__{indy and satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance. the interior is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and stalactites. their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds of loud dripping, whistling air drafts and scampering claws.}
<B>__{hall of shadows}
<A>__{indy leads the way down a twisting hallway, satipo's torch barely lighting his way from behind. indy disappears in a shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket. indy doesn't notice and disappears into another shadow, emerging with two more tarantulas on his back. satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound. indy looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and casually brushes all three spiders off with his rolled whip, as he would a fly. satipo pirouettes for an inspection and indy flicks one off the peruvian's back. indy begins picking up little pocket sized artifacts from the niches and ledges of the temple. he continues to do this as the men penetrate the temple. his collecting is quick and expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant, discarding some, stuffing others into his clothes, and never stopping his forward progress.}
<B>__{chamber of light}
<A>__{the men reach an arch in the hall. the small chamber ahead, which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a shaft of sunlight from high above. indy stops, looks it over.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{what's wrong? are you lost?}
<A>__{indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of light. giant spikes spring together from the sides of the chamber with a ferocious clang! and impaled on the spikes are the remains of a white man, half fleshed, half skeleton, in explorer type grab. indy reaches out and takes hold of the man's carcass. as the spikes slowly retract, indy pulls it free and seats the remains gently on the floor.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{forrestal.}
<C>__{satipo}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{we can go no further.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{now, satipo, we don't want to be discouraged by every little thing.}
<A>__{indy steps sideways into the chamber. his back pressed against the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side. satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through.}
<B>__{stairway}
<A>__{indy and satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing. framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the opening even more.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(taking torch)}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<A>__{he lowers the torch to the floor of the landing. the landing is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of another, all squashed flat as cardboard. satipo gasps. indy looks up at the ceiling of the landing, then steps onto skeletons, which make a cracking noise under his feet.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{try not to touch the vines.}
<B>__{foyer of the sanctuary}
<A>__{the men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long. the door at the end is flooded with sunlight.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{senor, i think we are very close.}
<A>__{indy stands still looking at the hall.}
<C>__{satipo}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{let us hurry. there is nothing to fear here.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that's what scares me.}
<A>__{they begin walking down the hall side by side. satipo has inched a little ahead. suddenly his lead foot comes down and through the floor! as satipo begins to pitch forward, indy grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. they both look down at the "floor". indy swings his whip across the floor. fifteen feet of it cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit as wide as the hall. the illusory floor was made of dust covered cobwebs. satipo picks up a stone and drops it down the pit. no sound. the two men exchange glances. indy looks up at the high roof of the hall. he swings the whip up around a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the whip. from the other side he swings the whip back to satipo, who throws indy the torch. satipo swings across. when they are both standing on solid floor there is a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below splash! indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves it strung to the beam for quick retreat.}
<B>__{the sanctuary}
<A>__{a large, domed room. ten evenly spaced skylights send their shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. indy and satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room at the altar. there, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny jeweled figurine, indy's real objective. two torches, many years old, are in holders by the door. indy takes one down and lights it. he gives the regular torch to satipo.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{there's plenty of light, amigo.}
<A>__{indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out and tap a white tile. it is solid. he taps a black tile. there is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch. satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole there.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{from that hole!}
<A>__{indy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. the entire room is honey comed with the same kind of hole. satipo sees it too and is properly impressed.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you wait here.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{if you insist, senor.}
<A>__{torch in hand, indy begins his careful walk across the sanctuary. stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears to be doing a martial arts kata. before each big move he waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the flame. halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels to look at it. a dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. its body is riddled with little deadly darts. this has great significance to indy and he stands with even greater caution. he waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame. indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it. satipo watches, wide eyed and mystified. indy reaches the altar. the tiny idol looks both fierce and beautiful. it rests on a pedestal of polished stone. indy looks the whole set up over very carefully. from his jacket he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. he begins filling it with dirt from around the case of the altar. when he has created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm concentrating. it's clear he wants to replace the idol with the bag as smoothly as possible. his hand seems ready to do that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his shoulder muscles. now he sets himself again. and makes the switch! the idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal. for a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone beneath the bag drops five inches. this sets off an aural chain reaction of steadily increasing volume as some huge mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple. indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at four times the speed. satipo's eyes widen in terror. he turns and runs. the retreat intercutting indy and satipo the sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to the mysterious mechanism. just as indy goes out the door, a rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles floor. immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts fills the room.}
<B>__{in the foyer}
<A>__{satipo swings across the pit. he makes it just as the whip comes undone from the beam, leaving indy without an escape. satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then turns back to face indy, who has run up to the far side of the pit.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{no time to argue. throw me the idol, i throw you the whip.}
<A>__{indy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{you have no choice! hurry!}
<A>__{indy concurs with that assessment. he tosses the idol across the pit to satipo. satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of his jacket, gives indy a look, then drops the whip on the floor and runs.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{adios, amigo!}
<A>__{indy grimaces. he had a feeling this might happen. he looks around.}
<B>__{at the vined landing}
<A>__{satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes the steps five at a time.}
<B>__{in the foyer}
<A>__{indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad jumps into space. he doesn't make it. his body hits the far side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view. only wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops his descent. with just the tips of his fingers over the edge, he begins pulling himself up.}
<B>__{at the chamber of light}
<A>__{satipo has slowed down. he begins to edge carefully around the light shaft.}
<B>__{at the vined landing}
<A>__{indy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom of the steps. his whip is grasped in his hand. as he raises himself, he hears, from above the giant spikes of the chamber of light clang! and an abrupt, sickening rendition of satipo's last scream. indy runs up the steps. the rumbling sound grows louder.}
<B>__{at the chamber of light}
<A>__{indy slides to a stop. the spikes have retracted, taking satipo's body to one side. indy edges into the chamber with his back to the shaft of light. soon he is face to face with the dead satipo; spikes protrude from several vital spots in the peruvian's body. indy removes the idol from satipo's pocket and moves quickly out the other side.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{adios.}
<B>__{the inclined passage}
<A>__{indy shoots out of a cut off hallway and turns toward the exit. the rumbling is very loud and now we see why: right behind indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of the passage, perfectly form fitted to the passageway. it obliterates everything before it, sending the stalactites shooting ahead like missiles. indy dashes for the light of the exit. his hat flies off his head. almost immediately it is crushed by the boulder. indy dives out the end of the passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance, sealing the temple.}
