<L>__{interior bar basement continuous}
<A>__{heroine, roadie, and coach make their way through the basement. creeks and cracks with every step.}
<C>__{roadie}
<P>__{(to heroine)}
<D>__{you handle yourself pretty well. you a cop or a criminal?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{neither. just a farmer.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{oh yeah? then how do you do it?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{i just think about my husband and daughter... and the rest is easy.}
<A>__{the light casts a shadow of something behind the curtain. roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed off barrel.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{easy.}
<A>__{whip! the curtain slides. it's a dried animal hide on a hook. they all sigh. roadie unblocks the tiny door. heroine scans the room.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{this place is creepy in the daytime, too. ready?}
<A>__{coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{scared?}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{no. you?}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{of course not. i fight monsters all the time.}
<P>__{(gripping the door)}
<D>__{on three.}
<A>__{roadie, heroine raise their weapons.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{one... two... three!!!}
<A>__{roadie whips open the door. nothing. bang gong gong! some pipes crash to the ground next to them... they jump, but nothing is there. a little mouse emerges from the fallen heap.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{well, look at that.}
<A>__{coach leans down and puts out his hand. he smiles as heroine watches over his shoulder.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{hey, little fella.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{he leaves the mouse and follows heroine to the tunnel. slurp! a pink tongue lassos the mouse. a red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. they all drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{looks like a brothel for plants.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{shhhhhhhhhhhhh.}
