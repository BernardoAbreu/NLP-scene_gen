<L>__{exterior country road day}
<A>__{the jeep stops at a fence, where a herd of cattle graze on the other side. matt jumps out to let the jeep through.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{i think this is where a golf course is going to be. they want the golf course to rival pebble beach, you know, bring in the big boys.}
<L>__{exterior bumpy access road day}
<A>__{the jeep ascends through pastoral countryside.}
<L>__{exterior lookout point day}
<A>__{the jeep stops at the overlook of an astonishingly beautiful swath of land extending from hilltop to bay. all get out, walk to the edge, look out.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{are you shitting me? you guys own all this land?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not personally. it belongs to a trust. but yeah, it's ours for a few more days.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{the other side of that ridge too. you can't see it from here. it's like this, but a little flatter and doesn't have as nice a bay.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{this is outrageous.}
<C>__{cousin ralph}
<P>__{(pointing, to matt)}
<D>__{yep. big resort there on that pointerior commercial area over there, houses all through there. i think they should put in a big zip line. hell, we should have put in a zip line.}
<A>__{all continue to ogle this awe inspiring sight.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{of course, part of me agrees with the cousins who don't want to sell. they're going to make a pretty big stink at the meeting.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i know, but we have to sell. the trust has to dissolve in seven years, and if we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess. selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{but it's a shame, yeah? on the other hand, hey, it's just sitting there. no one's using it. at least this way the whole world will be able to enjoy it.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to his daughters)}
<D>__{take a good look, girls. in the old days, this was part of your great great grandmother's inheritance going all the way back to kamehameha i.}
<A>__{with them, we look across this land, vivid and verdant.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{down there is where mom and i would camp.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we all did, all our lives. a lot of memories.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{what about me? i want to camp. i wish we lived in the old days.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{we do. we still do.}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{do we really have to sell?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{doing anything else would get extremely complicated. a lot of your cousins just want the money. everything has its time.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i want us to keep it!}
<A>__{matt looks over at scottie, then at alexandra. it's clear that alexandra is moved by this sight.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{can you like specify what businesses they'll put here? because you should totally get a cheesecake factory. only one so far's in waikiki, and it's awesome. you definitely need a cheesecake factory. and taco john's.}
<A>__{moments later the kings approach a nearby monument commemorating "john lowell "keoni" king. 1899 1974. the plaque depicts a smiling man atop a horse.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to the girls)}
<D>__{my grandfather. he really loved this place. so did your mother. so does your mother.}
