<L>__{interior helen's bathroom night}
<A>__{helen is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her chest.}
<C>__{ruben }
<D>__{helen? open the door. the guy's nothing. a burglar.}
<A>__{she sits there, says nothing.}
<C>__{ruben }
<D>__{open the door. please.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{why don't you shoot off the lock?}
<A>__{she starts to laugh. the sound is awful. after a moment, she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door. ruben takes her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it. wets a washcloth, goes to sponge off her face. she is trembling.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he was in my apartment!}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i know, baby. i know.}
<A>__{without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak out, she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down the hallway, ruben follows, tries to put his arms around her.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{it's okay... you're safe with me!}
<A>__{he pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight around her, holding her still. he smoothes her hair, rubs her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{when i was a little kid, and i'd be in a state, my father would hold me on his lap, until all the fight would go out of me...}
<A>__{she breaks free and whacks him across his nose.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you think you're my daddy?}
<A>__{there is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that ruben kisses her. she goes limp, kisses him back, then she's suddenly sobbing. his nose is bleeding, but she's smiling. something between them has finally connected. been agreed upon.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{helen...honey, you know i gotta go.}
<A>__{he digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you know how to use this?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they taught me at the fbi. i was very good at it. it scared me... i liked it.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer. stay put.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{he goes. a song begins, prelapping the following scenes: "murder by numbers" by the police...}
<D>__{"once that you've decided on a killing first you make a stone of your heart and if you find that your hands are still willing you can turn murder into an art..."}
<A>__{helen opens the weapon, seemingly competent enough to handle it well, and empties out the bullets. she locks it up and}
<B>__{heaves a sigh of relief. the song continues...}
