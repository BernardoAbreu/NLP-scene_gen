<P>__{(muted)}
<D>__{... trevor.}
<A>__{trevor retraces his steps back to the door of ellen's plant filled, personalized computer lab. over the clacking of computer keys...}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{eskander filed for stress leave. they want me to finish out the semester.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{that's great...}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(with humility)}
<D>__{it's only 'til the end of the year.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{listen, i never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder.}
<A>__{trevor flickers a conciliatory nod, now he averts his eyes.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{that's okay.}

<D>__{hey, have you seen benny lately?}
<P>__{(as trevor shrugs)}
<D>__{ford told me he hasn't phoned his p.o. in four days.}
<P>__{(weighs guilt; whispering)}
<D>__{you know what they say. be careful what you pray for. don't get me wrong, benny's made my life a living hell. i even moved back in with my mother because of him. i love my mother, but if i eat one more dinner off a tv tray or watch one more rerun of 'wheel of fortune,' i think i will lose my fucking mind.}

<D>__{time's up. everyone stop working.}
<A>__{realizing now that all the clacking computer keys have stopped moments ago. all eyes are fixed on ellen and trevor. ... big knowing grins all around.}
