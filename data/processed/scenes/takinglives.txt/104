<L>__{exterior intersection day}
<A>__{police radios busy with chatter. uniforms clear a path for two patrol cars. sirens whoop as they coast in, tap bumpers, blocking the intersection. police officers form a formidable skirmish line. shouting for revelers to move aside.}
<L>__{exterior festival street night}
<A>__{asher running. gun in his pocket. elbowing his way through the crowd. asher reacts. he sees the gauntlet of uniforms and patrol cars blocking the intersection ahead. asher shoves his hand in his pocket... boom! boom boom! pop pop pop! thunderous gunfire. grace hits the deck. the uniforms hit the deck. the crowd screams, claps and whistles. it's not gunfire...}
<B>__{tilt up.}
<A>__{fireworks unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire. rivers of sparks. grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second. grace looking around for asher. laval reaches her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{shit. you see him?}
<A>__{pop pop boom! more fireworks. laval gestures for some uniforms to spread out.}
<B>__{a shrill scream o.s.}
<A>__{from an apartment building. grace runs into the building. laval follows her.}
