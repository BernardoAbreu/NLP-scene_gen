<L>__{exterior ben's house day}
<A>__{ben and johan arriving at the house. an unsympathetic small crowd is there waiting... they react, murmuring in afrikaans, watching them with hostility as ben and johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. the wreckage. the garage and ben's study have been bombed. johan leaves ben and rushes to the house. the crowd starts to disperse. the entire tools cupboard has been methodically ripped apart and the contents strewn on the garage floor. everything is half burnt... charred... ben has sunk onto the stool in total defeat. there's silence. then johan appears at the door. he hands ben a large envelope in it, the file with all the papers. ben looks up at johan.}
