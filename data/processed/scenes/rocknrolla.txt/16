<A>__{start credits over sports arena entrance. lenny is being walked down a corridor, the walls are lined with photographs of old soccer stars. on each side of him are two escorts(ex military types, heavy looking). as they pass each door, we realize where ever he is going, it has to be important. the escorts talk in to their microphones and to the different guards on each door way. every now and then we see the sports arena in the back ground. at last we reach the main door to the head office.}
