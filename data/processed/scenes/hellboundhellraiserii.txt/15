<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{kirsty has her hands over her face and is shaking. ronson stands and crosses to her. he takes her hand from her face and calms her.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{easy, easy. whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i saw it...him. but i got away. and i took the box. and i solved it. and they came.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{the cenobites.}
<A>__{she stares directly at ronson, daring him to disbelieve.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{the demons.}
<A>__{ronson stares back, perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes. on the soundtrack, the sudden and shocking sound of a door being slammed open and hitting the wall. kirsty screams. even ronson is startled. in the doorway are doctor malahide and kyle. malahide advances into the room, smiling apologetically as he does so.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{sorry. must get that door fixed. detective ronson?}
<A>__{malahide holds his hand out, as ronson nods in response.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{i am doctor malahide.}
<A>__{the man shake hands. malahide gestures behind him.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{my assistant, kyle macrae. and this must be kirsty?}
<A>__{malahide speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the way. as he says her name, he smiles benignly at kirsty who, still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of the door, simply stares at him. malahide turns his attention back to ronson, drawing him away and speaking to him in a lower voice. meanwhile, kyle walks over to kirsty and smiles at her long enough to embarrass her into smiling back.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{i've read the boy's statement. quite the adventure they believe they had. i'd like to talk to her alone. do you think ... ?}
<A>__{ronson looks over his shoulder at kirsty. he then looks carefully at malahide and then nods slowly.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{mmmm. o.k. frankly, i think she's more your territory than mine. shame.}
<A>__{ronson looks back at kirsty.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{kirsty. doctor malahide's going to look after you now. maybe we could talk some more tomorrow.}
<A>__{kirsty nods vaguely and then, just as ronson reaches the door, calls out to him.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{wait! the mattress. you've got to destroy it. she died on it, you see. the mattress. it's haunted now. she can come back... like frank. she can come back.}
<A>__{ronson smiles helplessly at her, then glances at malahide with a "you see what i mean" expression, and leaves the room.}
<C>__{kirsty }
<D>__{the mattress ...}
<A>__{malahide stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his face and then abruptly follows ronson through the door. kirsty is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but kyle stares incredulously as malahide leaves the room.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{uh...excuse me a moment.}
<A>__{he follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down the corridor.}
