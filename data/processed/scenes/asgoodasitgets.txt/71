<L>__{interior carol's apartment night}
<A>__{carol seated working on a letter... she is trying to express her gratitude... an enormous sheaf of completed pages sit next to her... she is so involved she doesn't even look up as a young man, sean, knocks on the door and is let in by beverly. they exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly hear spencer greeting him... we move in and read over carol's shoulder "i'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my conscionce (sic) forever if i didn't tell you how gratefull (sic)... "}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{you're not still writing that thank you note?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i'm on the last page. how do you spell conscience?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{c o n s c i e n c e. i got sean from the bakery to baby sit so let's go out.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i still don't feel safe leaving spencer with someone. how do you spell it again?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{spencer is okay. you'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. if you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...}
<P>__{(struts and pumps her arms)}
<D>__{you ought to get mr. udall to send you over a psychiatrist.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(more emotionally than she intended)}
<D>__{i don't need one 'cause i know what's really going on here. i have to finish this letter or i will go nuts.}
<P>__{(looking at paper; weepy)}
<D>__{this can't be right con science.}
<A>__{carol breathes heavily gets control, stopping herself on the brink of crying.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{carol. what?}
<A>__{carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able to stem the flow... wide eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for carol to let it go. a last defiant snort from carol and then she is overwhelmed. the headline comes first.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't know... it's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. without that you just start thinking about yourself and what does that ever get anybody. today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and i felt myself giving them a dirty look i had no idea everything was...}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(great, forceful hand gestures)}
<D>__{... moving in the wrong direction... away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking sorry hands with, for christ's sake. i was feeling like really bad that dr. bettes is married.}
<P>__{(this next one's tough)}
<D>__{which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to... like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. he has to make up for his mom not getting any.}
<P>__{(weeps at her insight)}
<D>__{oh, boy. who needs these thoughts?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{spencer's doing fine. so what are you saying, that you're frustr...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{leave me be! why are you doing this? why are you picking at my sores... what is it that you want?... you want what? what's with you? i hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose.}
<P>__{(puffy; red; furious)}
<D>__{what is it, mom? no kidding.}
<A>__{slumped, fought out carol gets out one last, naked husky voiced question.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what is it you want? what?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i want us to go out.}
<A>__{a beat, then.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{okay.}
