<L>__{interior corridor police station night}
<A>__{detective franki leads railly past crowded holding cells.}
<C>__{franki}
<D>__{ so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. all they got was his name. they figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{he's been tested for drugs?}
<C>__{franki}
<D>__{negative for drugs. but he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. no drugs. you believe that?}
<A>__{franki pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed glass in an otherwise solid door, and railly looks through it. railly's pov through the window: a man, his back to her, in strait jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you have him in restraints.}
<C>__{franki}
<D>__{were you listening? we got two officers in the hospital. yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. look at him! still on his feet.}
<A>__{railly's pov through the window: the man in the cell turns, looks right at her. in spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly cole.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{that would explain the bruises, i guess. the struggle.}
<C>__{franki}
<D>__{you want to go in? examine him?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{yes, please. you said he gave a name...}
<C>__{franki}
<P>__{(unlocking the door)}
<D>__{james cole. that's everything we got. none of the james coles on the computer match him. no license, no prints, no warrants. nothing. you want me to go in with you?}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{franki}
<D>__{i will be right here...just in case.}
