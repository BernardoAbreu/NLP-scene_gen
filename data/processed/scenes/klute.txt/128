<L>__{exterior brownstone entryway night}
<A>__{bree, klute approach unhurriedly along the sidewalk. she is holding his arm, hums to herself, enjoys the evening.}
<L>__{interior stairwall night}
<A>__{we follow them up.}
<L>__{interior angle into bree apartment night}
<A>__{the apartment is a shambles furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped.}
<L>__{interior bree apartment night}
<A>__{klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. bree follows more slowly, whispering:}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{oh jesus. oh jesus.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{don't touch anything.}
<A>__{he moves quickly to the rear of the apartment, looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass then returns to the table at the front of the apartment; his folders. bree cracks wise, unsteadily.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{you suppose he's a married fella?}
<A>__{angle to table; folders the contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and we zoom in the photographs of tom grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, even the company picnic photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of grunemann in the front row.}
<B>__{klute}
<A>__{he stands, looking down, taking no notice as }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{he got in my clothing!}
<A>__{then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply:}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{oh. oh.}
<A>__{he turns quickly. she is holding out, at arms length, a pair of her underpants. with a disgust so extreme she can only laugh.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{oh look what he did in them.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{she doesn't respond. he seizes her arm, shakes the garment back onto the floor. she starts to gag, slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the bathroom. klute yanks her back.}
<C>__{klute }
<D>__{stay out of there.}
<A>__{she twists free of his hands, backs away. the same elementary terror we've seen before.}
<C>__{klute }
<D>__{listen to me: it's all right. i've been expecting something.}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(full out, vengefully)}
<D>__{my god, i thought it was over. and here i am, daddy, right back at the start.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{bree }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{right back at the start, right?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{go down in my room.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{you said it was over, right? you said not to worry any more, all over, right?}
<A>__{she's broken for the door; it's questionable that she's even heard him. he hasn't time to pursue shouts again }
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{go down in my room and wait.}
<A>__{then he turns back into the apartment.}
