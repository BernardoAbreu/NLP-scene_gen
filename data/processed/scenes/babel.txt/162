<L>__{interior entrance to chieko's apartment night}
<D>__{chieko opens the door and runs into kenji, who greets her as if she were just anybody.}
<C>__{kenji}
<D>__{hello. she bows.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{they told me you wanted to talk to me. chieko, who has been unable to read his lips, asks him with her hands that he speak slowly and face her. kenji is embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more considerate.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{i'm sorry. is there something you wanted to tell me? chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. kenji takes off his shoes and leaves them at the door. chieko leads him to the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything to drink.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{do you have tea? chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. kenji glances over the apartment. chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. a small bulb lights. kenji just watches her. chieko gestures for him to sit down. kenji and chieko sit across from each other. chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down and hands it over to kenji. kenji reads, seems surprised and reads again slowly.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{"my father had nothing to do with my mother's death," what's this? chieko is disconcerted at the question. she takes her notebook and starts writing. kenji reads and turns to her.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{your father was asleep when she jumped off the balcony? she nods. she gets up, asks kenji to go with her and walks toward the balcony.}
