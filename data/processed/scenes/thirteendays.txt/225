<L>__{interior fbi, counter intelligence department files night}
<A>__{bang! a stack of files slams down beside kenny on a large paper covered conference table. walter sheridan, kenny's investigator buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like kenny. kenny and walter rifle through the folders, super fast, super proficient. a half dozen fbi agents work around the table.}
<C>__{sheridan}
<D>__{okay. so, what we've got is this guy alexander feklisov, aka alexander fomin, declared consul to the soviet embassy, but in reality the kgb papa spy. an illustrious tour of duty during the great patriotic war gets him on the party fast track, various tours of duty in kgb, american postings. he's an expert on us, and... that's all we've got on papa spy.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{who's he talking for? is it khruschev, or is this more bullshit?}
<A>__{kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{how do you become the kgb top spy in the united states?}
<C>__{sheridan}
<D>__{gotta know someone.}
<A>__{kenny whirls on sheridan. a frozen beat.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{politics is politics. walter.}
<P>__{(whirling on agents)}
<D>__{khruschev is the moscow party boss under stalin. give me their career chronologies!}
<A>__{walter pushes a typed dateline of khruschev's major career moves, and one of the agents hands kenny a list of fomin's postings. he lays them side by side. and for every step of khruschev's, there's a step for fomin. not only that, but the dates are identical or nearly so.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{every time khruschev moves up, fomin does within a year...}
<P>__{(tracing up the list)}
<D>__{khruschev was the administrator in charge of preparing moscow's defenses during the war. and fomin... was here in the u.s.}
<A>__{kenny's face falls. but a young fbi agent cuts in.}
<C>__{young fbi agent}
<D>__{not at first.}
<A>__{the young fbi agent proffers him a file. kenny snatches it.}
<C>__{young fbi agent }
<D>__{he was an engineer stationed outside moscow in '42. specialized in tank traps.}
<A>__{kenny looks up at walter. walter nods sagely, lights a pipe.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they know each other. they're war buddies.}
<C>__{sheridan}
<D>__{it's thin. but real life usually is.}
<A>__{a phone on the table shrills, shattering the silent triumph.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{i've got to move. what do you have, kenny?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they know each other! khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies!}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{you're sure...}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...}
<P>__{(off walter's nod)}
<D>__{walter agrees. my gut's telling me khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{okay, ken. we're going.}
