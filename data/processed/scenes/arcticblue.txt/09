<L>__{exterior haul road and pipeline close day}
<A>__{a metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a pipeline support piling:}
<B>__{pipeline utility corridor private property no trespassing no hunting no trapping no shooting wider}
<A>__{eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead of him. although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's confident and resolute in attitude. his clothes have a distinctly western feel: lucchese boots, levis 501's, mahan cotton shirt. his down parka is unzipped in the sunny, windless, forty degree afternoon. he pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a four power scope mounted atop it. he peers through the scope. his pov through scope he puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big, ivory white timber wolf, fifty yards away.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{anne marie stands beside eric, a nikon with a telephoto lens in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation. she's twenty three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue eyes. she wears eddie bauer woman's gear like she was born in it. eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger. but instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull pop of a co2 powered dart gun.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{the tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy shoulder. the wolf takes off running, but almost immediately slows, sits, then lies down. eric and anne marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing deeply. eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what a beauty.}
<P>__{(to anne marie)}
<D>__{hand me the transmitter.}
<A>__{anne marie passes to eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band. eric puts the collar loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all the while talking soothingly to the semi conscious animal. anne marie smiles at eric's tenderness and snaps some photos. with the collar in place and transmitter activated, eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's coming around fine.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{be right back. i left my camcorder in the car.}
<B>__{follow anne marie}
<A>__{as she hurries back to their international scout. on the door of the scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick, under which are the words:}
<B>__{northland petroleum corp.}
<A>__{anne marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.}
<B>__{angle on eric and the wolf}
<A>__{eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and trots unsteadily away. near the treeline the wolf turns, glances back at eric and then disappears into the forest.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{anne marie is taping the wolf's retreat. looking through the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline piling and a rock formation. eric turns toward her and a glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{anne marie! stop!}
<A>__{she glances down. something metal is half buried in the dead leaves and gravel.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{eric runs over. he pokes at the object with a stick. with a snap, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half. anne marie jumps back. eric brushes the dead leaves on the ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the gully.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{goddamn trappers!}
<A>__{he angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing several others attached to one another by a long chain.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{takes nerve, laying traplines on restricted land.}
<A>__{eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring pointerior using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the haul road.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{he still might be around. i saw fresh tire tracks coming in.}
<A>__{his pov through scope the road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon, north and south. in the distance, a jeep is parked on the haul road. near it, a man climbs down into another shallow ravine.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{eric hurries down the footpegs.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{man and a jeep, about a mile and a half down.}
<A>__{he jumps into the scout. anne marie stuffs her cameras into the hatchback. as soon as she climbs in, eric tears out.}
