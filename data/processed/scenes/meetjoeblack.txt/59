<L>__{interior guest suite, parrish townhouse day}
<A>__{midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, joe passes through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises again, crosses back to the sitting room. susan appears in the doorway, joe suddenly senses her, turns around.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're here?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{he stands, they regard each other for the moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{may i take your coat?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, joe comes around her to help, susan senses him breathing in the scent at the back of her neck.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i just thought i'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, i was in the neigh borhood }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how beautiful.}
<A>__{he starts to hang susan's coat up.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{just throw it on the chair.}
<A>__{joe holds her coat carefully on the chair. an awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot to foot.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{when i called, they said that you and daddy had just left the office.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he's taking a nap.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he must be tired this bontecou thing }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, he's tired. i believe so.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{you must be hungry?}
<A>__{susan sits on the couch.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, not anymore. are you?}
<A>__{joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the couch beside her.}
<C>__{susan }
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{are you cold?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{...no.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{maybe it's the draft through the door.}
<A>__{she gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to joe. a warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which susan recognizes as such, joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading. his movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin gers, odd things about her seem to interest him. this excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though joe has no know ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question has he done it before. strange territory for joe, not to be 'in control' and exert ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and susan builds. joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it. he feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. the powerful contradiction is transmitted to susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences. spent, they lie in silence. finally susan speaks:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's so wonderful to make love to you. it's like making love to some one who has never made love before.}
<A>__{joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. he weighs, then resists, the impulse.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{did you like making love to me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i loved it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{more than you love peanut butter?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{she laughs at the earnestness with which he answers. joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{nowhere? i'm...here.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{for how long?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, i hope a long, long time.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{me, too.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it will come to us.}
