<L>__{interior house}
<A>__{it's one of those great beach houses. light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house. marin, now in a tight tank, tight pants, gives harry the grand tour as she continues to undress.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(taking off her belt)}
<D>__{the fabulous living room, perfect for entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone.}
<P>__{(drops her belt then unbuttons harry's shirt)}
<D>__{behind me, the requisite hampton's deck complete with pool and ocean view.}
<C>__{marin }
<P>__{(unbuckles harry's belt)}
<D>__{your pants, please...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ladies first.}
<A>__{marin provocatively unzips her pants and wriggles out of them. she's now in a tiny tank and bikini panties.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{gourmet kitchen's to your left where tonight i will whip you up a culinary feast of mac and cheese.}
<A>__{marin hears harry's zipper unzip. she turns, her eyes widening as harry's pants land on a chair. harry is now down to his boxers, an open shirt and a fearless smile.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{.. o kay, going quickly now... master bedroom is that away...}
<A>__{they arrive in a warmly decorated guest bedroom.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{and this as they say on 'cribs', your favorite show, is where the magic happens. do we like it? going once, going twice ...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sold.}
<A>__{harry takes marin's hand and pulls her out of frame and onto the bed. she playfully rolls on top of him. his hands cup her ass.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{you know when i first started auctioneering someone told me if i was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear. this sort of gives that a whole new meaning.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why? you're not nervous now, are you?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i'm always a little nervous.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(removing his hands)}
<D>__{so put on your bathing suit. i brought some champagne, i will put it on ice.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{me like you, harry langer.}
<A>__{she bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom. harry lies there alone for a second. catches his breath. he sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest. he waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man.}
