<L>__{93: interior bedroom. the ross residence. day.}
<A>__{the girls prepare for festivity. they got a full length mirror. a wardrobe of dresses. a menu of shoes, what they do with them in this scene is their affair. right now margie's holding some blue number in front of helena."it's blue silk. you like blue?"}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{not "you" blue. this isn't you.}
<A>__{she slings the dress on the bed. it joins a pile of rehearsals. moves deeper into her dresses and helena appears in the mirror.}

<D>__{when did john divorce?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{two or three years ago.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{what was she like?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{suzanne? very pretty. she was a semi professional model. but a policeman's wife she wasn't. so one day, she just packed it and left. and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you know, he crashed. he just couldn't come to terms with it .. john hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. every spare minute, he's driving down to san diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..}
<A>__{she pirouettes with black sequins. "what do you think of black?" evidently not much and margie is getting short of alternatives.}

<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i haven't worn heels since i was 16. i don't think i could walk in these?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{sure you can. anyway, parties are all about standing still ..}
<A>__{helena is excited to try them out. the experiment is a success.}
<D>__{i will go get the dress .. it's kinda sultry .. i only wore it once, coz in reality, i can't get away with it ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{you think john would like it?}
