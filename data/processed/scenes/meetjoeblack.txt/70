<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate afternoon}
<A>__{allison is everywhere, parrish emerges from his wing, she catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a demille like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making lightning decisions. parrish turns his attention now to an ice filled fountain encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux cyrillic, a 'b' and a 'p', as rubber booted delivery men carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each letter. a smile creases parrish's face as, in an unexpected lull, allison backs into him at the fountain.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{hi, daddy, what do you think?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's starting to grow on me. but what do the 'b' and 'p' mean?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{the fountain is the caspian sea and the sea is serving up caviar. the 'b's for beluga, the 'p' for petrossian. of course, they also stand for 'bill' and for 'parrish'.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{do they, m'dear?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{ plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from the russian tea room. i've dressed him in a cossack shirt and he'll sing nelson eddy songs.}
<A>__{parrish shakes his head.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you are amazing. why, oh why, allison, are you doing all this?}
<A>__{but before she can answer, a workman is tugging at allison's sleeve, she turns away from parrish to give him instructions out of parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i do it because i love you. because everybody i loved you. mommy wher ever she is susan, quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yeah? and what about my enemies?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{they respect you. isn't that a kind of love?}
<A>__{unexpectedly, allison brushes a lock away from parrish's forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{above all, you've been a wonderful father.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i haven't been the father to you that }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{that you've been to susan?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i wasn't going to say }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{but that's what you were thinking. and that's okay. because i know you love me. not like it is with susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when i walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "what does she want now?"}
<A>__{a weather beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th infantry regiment "c" (charlie) company.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{i already feel i've had everything i could have wanted for my birthday }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{hey, there's lots to come.}
<P>__{(gesturing to me activity)}
<D>__{a little excess like you love.}
<A>__{the preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate plans coming to fruition.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{allison wades into the maelstrom now, parrish watches her go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.}
