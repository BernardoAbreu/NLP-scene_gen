<A>__{the panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses. dust and debris billow upwards. the battered monster mask breaks loose from fred's costume, bounces on the floor. slowly, everyone gets up: fred... barney ... and two halves of the xenosaurus: the bottom half is piltdown; the top half is pyrite.}

<D>__{what the devil's going on here?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{it's real simple, mister slate. your boy lava here has been stealing the coo coo berries from the fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it!}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{that's ridiculous, flintstone! nobody could get that many coo coo berries off our premises!}
<A>__{suddenly the bottom of piltdown's canvas sack rips open. thousands and thousands of coo coo berries tumble out.}

<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{these sure look like coo coo berries to me }

<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{they're convincing fakes, mrs. rubble part of our exciting display }
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{fakes?}
<P>__{(to piltdown)}
<D>__{gee, pilty, i thought the real ones were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal whatta waste a time }
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{pyrite, shaddup }
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(snapping fingers)}
<D>__{now i remember! these guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant! what's this, lava... 'plan b'?}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{uncle! are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the slate family? this is absurd }
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{of course it is! why, without the coo coo berry sap, fibrerock would be completely }
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{ unstable...}
<A>__{suddenly the entire building shudders. dust falls from the ceiling. everyone looks at lava.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{all right, all right, i admit it! i got in over my head in the stock market... took some big losses... i had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when i saw all those coo coo berries being delivered every day, i guess i just lost my head... i figured with the woca sap in the fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous...}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{i will tell you what's superfluous, lava... your liver! so why don't we remove it !}
<A>__{he leaps, snarling, on top of lava... fred and barney pull them apart. then, more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems }
