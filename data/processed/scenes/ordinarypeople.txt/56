<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{maybe i need a tranquilizer.}
<C>__{dr berger}

<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{i think you came in here looking like something out of the body snatchers. it's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer.}
<A>__{conrad notices a cube on the table.}
<C>__{conrad}

<C>__{conrad }
<D>__{maybe... maybe i don't want to swim anymore. you know, i mean my timing is for shit. you know, he's got two guys that swim the fifty, they're better than me, and...}
<C>__{dr berger}

<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{it's the same thing that happened last year... it's the same damn thing i did last year.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{are you the same person you were last year?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{that's why you need a tranquilizer?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{you tell me!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{no. it's up to you!}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{fifty bucks an hour, can't you decide if i should have a pill or not? i mean, you're a doctor, i'm supposed to feel better! right?}

<D>__{the hospital was.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{it was? why?}
<C>__{conrad}
