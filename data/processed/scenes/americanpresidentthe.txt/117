<L>__{interior shepherd's bedroom night}
<A>__{shepherd opens his door, revealing sydney. agent cooper is letting her in.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i just came over here to tell you why i can't see you anymore.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(to cooper)}
<D>__{thanks, coop.}
<A>__{shepherd closes the door.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{look, i know you've had a tough day.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{not as tough as some. you want a drink? lemme take your coat.}
<A>__{but sydney doesn't take her coat off.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president, this isn't gonna work.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sure it will. you button the top button, and it doesn't fall off the hanger.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's not what i...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i didn't think so. listen...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i've really enjoyed the time we've spent together, but this has catastrophe written all over it. please, mr. president, don't pursue me outside the political arena.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{well, i have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena, so that leaves everything out, and that's unacceptable to me.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{if i were on your staff, i would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the western world.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{let's clear up a couple of things. number 1: i seldom prance. number 2: i have no intention of engaging in a character debate, and number 3: you're not on my staff.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes, of course, but if you'll follow the immutable }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{why is that, by the way?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{why aren't you on my staff?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you can't afford me.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{how much do you make?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{more than you do, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{the name's andy. how much money do you make?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what the hell does it matter how much money i }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you would raise your voice to the president?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm only thinking about the health of your presidency. you think this morning's press conference was the end of it? bob rumson's gotta be drooling over this.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{are you attracted to me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i asked if }
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(of course she is)}
<D>__{that's not the issue }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{well, i tell you what. let's make it the issue. let's try something new, 'cause i know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about bob rumson's drool.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you're not most people.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you know what your problem is?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what's my problem?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sex and nervousness.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{sex and nervousness is my problem.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{yes. last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, i realized that those place settings were provided by the first ladies. and i will bet none of those first ladies were nervous about having sex with their president husbands. and you know why?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{no, but i'm sure you'll explain it to me.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i will. because they weren't presidents when they met them. not the case here.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{ahhhhhh.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you see what i'm getting at?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes. may i use your bathroom for a moment?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sure. it's right through there.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i want to freshen up.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{as you pass through, you'll see a large closet on your left. and if you feel comfortable, hang up your coat, and when you come back i will have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on the couch, and i will explain to you my plan.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you have a plan? don't make me wait. you're on a roll.}
<A>__{sydney disappears into the bathroom dressing room area. shepherd keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(speaking up)}
<D>__{okay. you're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the president. it's not always gonna be that way, and the reason i know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the president, and i know what a big step that was for you. so, sydney, i'm in no rush. here's my plan: we're gonna slow down. when you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen.}
<A>__{sydney comes back into the room...she's wearing one of shepherd's dress shirts and nothing else. she walks toward him.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{perhaps i didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the "slow down" plan.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you explained it great.}
<A>__{she moves closer to him.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you nervous?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{good. my nervousness exists on several levels. number 1 and this is in no particular order i haven't done this in a pretty long time. number 2: any expectations you might have, due to the fact that i'm, you know...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{the most powerful man in the world?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{exactly, thank you. just so you remember that's a political distinction that comes with the office. i mean, if eisenhower were here instead of me he'd be dead by now. and number three...}
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{andy...}
<A>__{they're both standing, facing each other... they gently kiss. they just stay with it until it becomes easier and better and exactly what they want.}
<C>__{rumson }
<D>__{does new hampshire want traditional american values back in the white house?}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{yes!!}
