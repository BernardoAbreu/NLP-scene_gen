<A>__{roll prologue over main title: a collage of old photos, prints, etc., and silent live action vignettes, all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly remembered dream. the first images show the opulence of the gilded age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their violence....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"the economic explosion following the civil war created an unprecedented nation wide market for beef. previously worthless cattle running wild throughout texas were gathered into herds and driven north to the railheads in kansas. fortunes were made as cowtowns sprang up on the prairies, wide open centers of commerce and vice, their streets choked with heavily armed young men fresh from the cattle drives. in those days the correct term for a cowhand was 'drover'. 'cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used. but these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street. in fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern new york or los angeles and there was no law but that of the gun."}
<A>__{a dashing figure in a prince albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin navy colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest. next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols flashing around the room like a strobe light:}
