<L>__{interior sera's bedroom night}
<A>__{sera wakes and ben comes in and gets into bed with her.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{very well... umm... i never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? i remember getting to the casino... i remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{well i was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. we were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. you seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. you smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. you kept yelling and yelling.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh, and what did you do?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but i talked them into letting me walk you out.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's impressive. how did you do that?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i told them you were an alcoholic and t would take you home. i also promised that we would never come in there again.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{yes, we.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(holds her hand)}
<D>__{what happened then?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{you were ok for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but i think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though i told you that we had plenty at home. in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. i asked you if you knew it was a hundred. you said you did, so i let you do it. we got here, you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i warned you...}
<P>__{(kisses her hand)}
<D>__{... but i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{here's my speech...}
<P>__{(kisses his hand)}
<D>__{... i know this shouldn't be acceptable to m, but it is. don't ask me why. i sense that your trouble is very big... and i'm scared for you... and so i'm doing what i think you need me to do. falling down in casinos is little stuff. it doesn't bother me. it has nothing to do with us.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's amazing. what are you? some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? how can you be so good?}
<A>__{she turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i don't know what you're saying. i'm just using you. i need you. can we not talk about it any more, please. not another word.}
<A>__{he thinks about this. he gently pushes her until she is lying on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes her naked back. he kisses her in the small of her back.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why don't you go back to sleep. i will go out and buy us some breakfast.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{be careful.}
<A>__{he stands and goes to the door.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{as he leaves the room, she calls after him.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{ben, i'm working tonight.}
<A>__{he opens the door and smiles at her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know.}
