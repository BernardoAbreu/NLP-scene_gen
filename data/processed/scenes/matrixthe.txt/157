<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}

<D>__{you need help. i'm coming with you.}

<D>__{no. no way. morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape. there's no way you're going back in.}

<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{did you tell morpheus?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{why? it wouldn't mean anything. he'd still believe what he wanted to believe. but morpheus is the one that matters. he's more important than me and we both know it.}
<A>__{he straps in.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i may not be what morpheus thinks i am, but if i don't try to help him, then i'm not even what i think i am.}
<C>__{trinity}
