<L>__{exterior resurrection city street day}
<A>__{a short time later. picard walking down the main street back toward the gates. people passing him, taking no notice of him...picard's mind thinking ahead. he happens to glance down a side street, then he stops.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{looking down the side street. ruby, the mysterious woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder. she stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt out old hover car... stares at it...then pulls a home made futuristic camera out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car. she continues on her way. picard is intrigued wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of. just then }
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{catch.}
<A>__{picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal canister with a screw top. the man who threw it steps into view. it's lieutenant scrimm. scrimm is the head of the town's militia. while not a physically threatening man, there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility. he's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm. before the war, scrimm was probably one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of armageddon came true. at the moment, scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to picard.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<P>__{(pleasant)}
<D>__{think you'll need that.}
<A>__{picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{it's no zone solution.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you know. "no ozone."}
<A>__{he points to the sky.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{oh... yes... ultraviolet protection. thank you. mister...?}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{lieutenant, actually. lieutenant jonathan scrimm. i'm the head of the resurrection protective force.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you are?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{jean luc picard.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{great name. french?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{you don't sound french.}
<A>__{scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never leave picard.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i was raised in england and here in the states. thank you for the... no zone.}
<A>__{picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any citizens of the town. scrimm falls in next to him.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{where in the states?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{oh... here and there. you know how it is.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{not really. i was born and raised right here. never had much use for travel.}
<A>__{he casually steps in front of picard, blocking his way.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{where are you from most recently?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(thinking fast)}
<D>__{california. san francisco.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{beautiful city. used to be, anyway. i didn't think anyone still lived there.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there's a few of us left.}
<A>__{picard steps around him and continues walking down the street. scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him again.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. how'd you do it?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it wasn't a trick. i used to be an electrical engineer.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{he steps in front of picard again, still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face. picard realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{and what were you doing out at the missile silo?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm an old friend of cochrane's... i wanted to see how he was doing.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{lucky for him you came by when you did. he might be dead now.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. we heard some explosions out there this morning...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.}
<A>__{scrimm eyes him evenly.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{you seem to have an answer for everything.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{something wrong with that?}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{a tense beat. then scrimm smiles easily.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<P>__{(re: balm)}
<D>__{be sure you put that on. you need a lot of protection around here.}
<A>__{he holds picard's eyes for a moment.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{thank you. but i've never had much trouble protecting myself.}
<A>__{now it's picard's turn to smile pleasantly at scrimm. picard walks around him and heads for the gates. scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...}
