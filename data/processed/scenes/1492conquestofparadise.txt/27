<L>__{interior alhambra palace throne room day}
<A>__{an ornate moorish door is pushed open by the duena's hand. we enter the throne room sculptured colonnades, mosaics... at the far end, windows open onto a view of granada's rooftops. against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of queen isabel of spain. the light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns. columbus falls to his knees.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{rise...! come forward!}
<A>__{he approaches the window, stopping close to her. isabel scrutinizes him quickly.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{i should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... and sanchez, that you are not a fool.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(bold)}
<D>__{no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors.}
<A>__{isabel smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{the ocean is uncrossable?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what did they say about granada before today?}
<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{that she was impregnable.}
<A>__{isabel smiles again.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{i cannot ignore the verdict of my council.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{surely you can do anything you want.}
<A>__{a direct challenge. she doesn't know what to make of this man.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{how little you know.}
<A>__{this little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment. now we sense columbus scrutinizing her.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{may i speak freely?}
<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{you show no inclination to speak otherwise!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i know what i see. i see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. who's not afraid. i see a women who thinks... "what if?"...}
<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(amused at his familiarity)}
<D>__{a woman?}
<A>__{a slight pause.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{forgive me... but you're the only queen i know.}
<A>__{she bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{then we are equal... since you are the only sailor i know!}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{how old are you, senor colon?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{thirty seven, your majesty... and you?}
<A>__{once again taken off guard, isabel flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{thirty eight...}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{you will be informed of our decision.}
<A>__{columbus bows and goes to leave. as the duena opens the door for him, he turns back.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{actually, i thought you were younger than me!}
<A>__{and he goes out, leaving her stunned.}
