<D>__{this is how they get the stones out of madison square garden, man. 4 smoked black limos fly outta the vip driveway and the fans jump on the limos...mayhem. those limos? empty. meanwhile, mick and the boys go out the service exit into delivery vans casual, rock star type shit.}
<A>__{harling helps him into the front seat and they pull away. the stones, "gimme shelter" starts to play... as they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of the hospital. trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of survivors.}
