<L>__{interior truck}
<A>__{the ugly man is driving. kumar is in the front seat, on the passenger side. harold is sandwiched between them.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{thanks for helping us out.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{no problem at all. saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would jesus do?"}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other. they then notice a jesus christ bobble head doll on the dashboard...}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{so, you boys worship christ?}
<A>__{the guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{uh...yeah.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{sure, he's great.}
<C>__{ugly man}
<D>__{great. good to hear it. the name's randy...but everyone calls me freak show.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i'm kumar. this is harold. good to meet you, mr...freak show.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{pleasure's all mine.}
<A>__{after a while, harold starts to notice that they're driving in the middle of a dark woods. it looks very sketchy.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{so where exactly are we going?}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{don't worry. my place isn't too far from here. once we get there, i will have your ride fixed up in a jiffy.}
<A>__{the guys silently continue driving, until kumar notices a rash of boils on freak show's neck.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering to harold)}
<D>__{eww check out those boils on his neck!}
<A>__{harold nudges him to be quiet. kumar looks back over at freak show and sees that one of the boils is pulsating.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{oh my god! you gotta look! one of them's actually pulsating!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{will you shut up? he's right next to me! he can hear you!}
<A>__{kumar sees that a white puss is now oozing from the boil.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{now there's some sort of puss! it's the most disgusting thing i've ever seen!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? you think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? he's two feet away from us. he can hear this entire conversation. he can hear me talking right now.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{don't worry, he can't hear anything. not with all that crust in his ear.}
<A>__{harold gives kumar a hard elbow to the stomach. he then looks nervously at freak show, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. harold seems relieved.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{i heard every word you said.}
<A>__{freak show doesn't say anything else. harold and kumar don't know how to react. they feel really uncomfortable. the fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.}
