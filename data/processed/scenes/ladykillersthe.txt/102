<L>__{interior munson house cellar day}
<A>__{as the professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. the money has been picked up and is once again in stacks upon the table.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{she shall be down shortly...}
<A>__{explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...tea. dainties.}
<A>__{the men nod, murmuring. the cellar door squeaks open. there is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair. using only tongue and teeth, the general flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives mrs. munson his usual deadpan look. she halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron and holding a spatula.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i don't know what you boys been up to but i wasn't born yesterday and i know mischief when i see it. now i want an explanation, but first i want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments. i been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play.}
<A>__{she turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the general a hard look which he innocently returns.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...hmph.}
<A>__{she turns again and clomps back up the stairs. the general opens his mouth and, again without using his hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip. lump is fretful:}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{professor?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes, lump?}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{i can't really play the buttsack.}
