<L>__{exterior backyard day}
<A>__{harry slowly walks along the rows in suzie's garden. he stands by the chicken cage. suddenly, the chickens start to run about and cackle as if a dog had gotten in. harry turns from the chicken coop. he stands still. sunny is hiding behind a bush. sunny steps around the bush. harry looks at sunny with such concentration that sunny takes a step backward as if getting ready to defend himself. mrs. baker, a black woman in her early thirties, comes out on the back porch. she shakes out a rug. she stops shaking the rug and stares at harry. harry becomes aware of mrs. baker's stare. he comes to himself and smiles at her.}
