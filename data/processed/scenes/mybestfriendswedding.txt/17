<L>__{interior fashion restaurant lunch hour}
<A>__{julianne enters with a really nervous kimberly in tow. approaches the maitre d'. we close to hear...}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{oh, mr. wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor.}
<A>__{points to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine. behind a glass wall, what looks like a british men's club. thirty guys and a billion cigars. as julianne starts toward it...}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{oh. mademoiselle.}
<A>__{she turns back. loves this shit.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{it's unofficial, of course. but, traditionally, the humidor is for gentlemen, only...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{great. i've got this girlfriend at the justice department? with all this time on her hands?}
<A>__{her look is every bit as hard as his. he gestures to the escalator. she takes kimmy's hand, and up they go. we can see walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie. kimmy licks her lips. they enter. every head turns. a nice range of reactions, from offended to attracted and points in between.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{piece of cake. i will hang, and think happy thoughts...}
<A>__{kimmy nods. heads over toward her father. julianne walks, confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of cigars. every eye in the place is on her butt. she runs her fingers over a few contenders. plucks one out, examines it, puts it back. walks a little farther. selects another, big and black. rolls it expertly in her fingers. sniffs along its length. a guy comes over. could be 40, successful, a broker's pin stripe. nearly as attractive as he thinks he is.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{know what you're looking for, little lady?}
<A>__{little lady, huh? she glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend not to notice. then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{yeah. do you?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i asked first.}
<A>__{ah. wit. she holds up her cigar...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i like 'em long and hard. kind of... big around.}
<A>__{runs it under her nose.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{smell is important, i'm a believer in that.}
<A>__{takes a match from a cut crystal bowl.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but you never know what you've got. till you run your tongue over it.}
<A>__{and she does. moistening the full length of the cigar. the boys are laughing openly. she strikes the match. as she lights up...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i meant. what you're looking for in a man.}
<A>__{she glances at his wedding ring. then, straight into his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{actually, i'm partial to married gentlemen.}
<A>__{the way she says that. the guy swallows. we can see some of the air has been sucked from the room.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why is that?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's so much time. when i phone the wives.}
<A>__{explosive laughter from the peanut gallery. as she jams the big clemente churchill into her mouth, she sees kimmy waving her over from across the room. without even looking at the guy she's just put away... ... she crosses the room, walter stands politely, looking very dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable interest. he waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather hassock.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{your idea?}
<A>__{she can't read this guy. maybe that's how he built an empire. she nods, yeah.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you're a woman of insight.}
<A>__{he sits on the arm of his chair. close enough to speak quietly.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{my wife and i love this marriage, and deplore its circumstances.}
<A>__{he puffs his cigar. julianne puffs her. kimmy looks on, a kid watching the grown ups...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{as you guessed, my daughter is unhappy about giving up her life. and, in my opinion, cowardly in avoiding the necessary confrontation.}
<A>__{then he stops. as if reading julianne's eyes.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{mike has a world of ability. i'd do anything to have him in my company.}
<A>__{one more puff.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{except ask him.}
<A>__{julianne is a little stunned. kimmy looks helpless.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he'd resent it. and me. and, most important, kim.}
<A>__{no smile on his lips. straight talk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he's a great kid, but he's still a kid. instead of recognizing that his resistance comes from insecurity, he'd turn it to anger. to protect himself...}
<A>__{spreads his hands...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{... from realizing that he's ignoring my daughter's needs, despite how very much he loves her.}
<A>__{he looks to his daughter now.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{they both have some growing up to do. but they're good people, they're starting with love. they've got time.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i think you're making a mistake, sir.}
<A>__{his eyes come back to her. a little sharply.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{and that interests me. how someone who knows him so well could be so wrong.}
<A>__{a formidable guy. she meets his gaze.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see, i love him, too, as much as anyone here. and for a whole lot longer.}
<A>__{from her heart.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i think i know best what would make him happy.}
