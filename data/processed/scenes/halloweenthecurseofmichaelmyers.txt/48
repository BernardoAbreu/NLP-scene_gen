<L>__{exterior myers house morning (continuous)}
<A>__{john strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument that's been left on his front lawn during the night. puffing on a cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, john raises a large axe. a group of neighborhood kids some dressed in halloween costumes stand a safe distance away. gathered on the sidewalk. gawking, whispering, tittering. john angrily swings the axe into the signpost. the kids jump with a collective start.}

<D>__{... michael myers ...}
<P>__{(timber)}
<D>__{... shit!}
<A>__{suddenly the sign crashes down and "michael myers" with it. the kids huddle. john turns on them, brandishing the axe.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property! one, two }
<A>__{that's all it takes. the kids scatter, tripping over one another as they tear off down the black. satisfied with himself, john stubs out his cigarette and hauls the sign and its now headless rider to the trash. then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters the house. uttering oaths under his breath. boom up over the surrounding neighborheed. superimpose: "haddonfield, illinois. halloween." last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and picturesque morning. children pour out of their homes, bursting with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes. even the myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of paint, somehow manages to look invite. a white van slowly rolls up the street. wknb logo, streamers and a large orange banner proclaiming: "haddonfield junior college harvest faire '95 see harry simms live october 31." a now familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{this is hard harry simms harping on ya from the big apple. tonight's the night and the place to be is the first annual harvest faire. so come on out of your broom closets, 'fielders, and bogey the night away with me.}
