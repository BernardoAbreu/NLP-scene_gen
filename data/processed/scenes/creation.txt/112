<L>__{interior gully's clinic. day}
<A>__{dr gully is the chief physician at malvern spa. his marble tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling pipes and dripping water. darwin reclines on a leather couch, watching the watery play of light on the ceiling. a door opens and dr gully comes in, accompanied by two assistants. gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt and tie. his trousers are tucked into calf length wellington boots. he greets darwin cheerfully, effusively.}
<C>__{mr gully}
<D>__{mr darwin, old friend. mr darwin. it has been too long i fear. tut tut tut tut tut. what have we now what have we now?}
<A>__{he clasps darwin's hand, feeling his pulse at the wrist, then commands him to open his mouth}

<D>__{tongue...}
<A>__{darwin shows him.}
<C>__{mr gully}
<D>__{ugh. shirt up. let me feel your liver.}

<C>__{dr gully}
<D>__{pulse hectic, togue furred, liver tender and enlarged.}
<A>__{darwin's ink stained fingers speak volumes.}
