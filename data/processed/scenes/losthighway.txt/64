<D>__{there! play it!}
<A>__{fred runs the tape forward. we see snow then a half second long medium shot of fred on his knees near the bedroom wall on renee's side of the bed. he is looking directly at the camera his face a ghastly grimace, contorted. his eyes are wide with horror. fred runs it back again and freezes the tape there on his tormented image. this image fills the screen. he and renee stare at it.}
