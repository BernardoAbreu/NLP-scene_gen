<L>__{exterior outskirts superior day}
<A>__{the car rattles on its last legs, as bobby mutters incantations, noticing a old, ghostlike mining company at the base of the mountains overlooking the town. it's deserted now, no one visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense the ancient richness and power of this town. bobby moves on.}
<L>__{exterior harlin's garage day}
<A>__{down the road from the mining company, bobby's car pulls into a small gas station, made of weather beaten wood, its windows long since dusted over. the pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties. above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: harlin's. bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain, he opens the hood. a plume of steam hits him in the face.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{bobby looks around for someone, anyone. after a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn. he waits, then blows it again. from out of the station walks darrell a slow looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty. he looks the part of a yokel.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you harlin?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{nope. darrell.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{harlin around?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{he's up at the look out.}
<A>__{darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{will he be back soon?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{doubt it. he's dead. the look out's a cemetery.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you own this place?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{then why do you call it harlin's?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{'cause harlin used to own it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but he's dead.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you want to take a look at my car? i think the radiator hose is }
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{damn. gonna be another hot one today. sometimes i don't even want to get out of bed. course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. then of course the clouds come in...}
<A>__{darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag. it doesn't so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look, harlin, i've got places to be.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{darrell }
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{ok. darrell... could you just take a look at my radiator hose. it's busted.}
<A>__{darrell is clearly upset at being cut off. he leans into the car and looks at the engine.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{it's your radiator hose. it's busted.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i know it's busted. what did i just tell you?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{if i could do you think i'd be standing here wasting my time. can you fix it, or do i have to go somewhere else?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{somewhere else? mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay, i'm stuck. you happy? now can you fix it, or not?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{yeah, i can fix it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{great!}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one, or close enough. gonna take time.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how much time?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what time is it now?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{twenty after ten.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{jesus. twenty after ten and it must be ninety already.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{ninety two. course half hour from now might be seventy two. these clouds move around a lot.}
<A>__{bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{what happened to your hand?}
<A>__{self consciously bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{accident.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{you got to be more careful. hands is important. let me show you something. when i was a kid, now i don't know if you can still see it, but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm very interested in this but is there someplace...}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{diner up a piece. not much, but us simple folk like it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i will be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?}
<A>__{darrell slams down the hood.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{just a car.}
<A>__{bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's not just a car. it's a sixty four and half mustang convertible. that's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and i'm just passing through.}
<A>__{the trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking bobby from darrell, acting as a partition between them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now do you mind? i got to get some stuff out of the trunk.}
<A>__{he throws the car key to darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack. concealed by the trunk lid, bobby pulls out a gun (a .9mm black baretta), wrapped in a t shirt, from the top of the bag. perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it. sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside. with a look around, bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk. briefly we notice a towing rope under the mat. there is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.}
