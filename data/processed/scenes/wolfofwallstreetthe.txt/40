<D>__{but what if they didn't sound like jerk offs? what if i took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? i reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. something patrician, blue blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti semitism.}

<D>__{gentlemen, welcome to stratton oakmont. the clients we've gone after in the past they're done. we will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of americans. the methods we've used over. loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{in military terms it's like carpet bombing noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. as stratton brokers you will be laser guided smart bombs aimed at high priority targets. you will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. now the key to every sale is this:}
<A>__{jordan writes the word "urgency" on the board.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{no one buys stock unless he thinks it's going up and going up now. you must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted. if he says i will think about it and call you back, it's over, you're dead! no one calls back! so you have to create urgency }
