<A>__{ethan unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver. he's holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a modernist cockroach. he clicks the cockroach into the guts of the phone's wiring, piercing it with its little prongs. he screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone's tongue down for a second, releases it and listens. he has a dial tone. now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart. after a moment, a flat voice comes on the other side.}
