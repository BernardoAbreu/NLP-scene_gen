<L>__{exterior manhattan street day}
<A>__{chyron: later that week something is wrong. it's a typical midtown street, but everything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets, the sidewalks, the cars. people walk along the streets, carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. nobody talks, nobody smiles. gray birds fly silently in the sky. there is no noise whatsoever. there are several movie theaters on the block. all marquees advertise john malkovich movies. around the corner comes malkovich. he is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, jeweled throne. he wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly, majestically. floris sits on his lap. she is dressed in an orange satin gown. nobody on the street looks up.}

<D>__{i am bored. you will dance for your king now.}
<A>__{without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number. totally silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. we see that maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. her face is void of expression. malkovich laughs.}

<D>__{faster! faster, my little trained monkeys!}
<A>__{the crowd dances faster and faster. older people fall over, exhausted, clutching their hearts. nobody stops dancing to help, nobody dares.}
