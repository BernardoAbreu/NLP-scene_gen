<A>__{john coughs, struggles to stand. he tries to cover but it's obvious his end is nearing. midnite positions angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides crucifixion style. she tries but can't break free. john puts a hand to her forehead }

<A>__{angela's body stops fighting. the darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade. it's working... midnite is suddenly jerked backwards with an agonizing yell. angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness. john watches in horror as midnite's 300 pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an invisible grasp, slammed into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible force against the floor. midnite glares at john, tries to speak. but the words die on his lips. enraged, john scans the empty room, sees a large shadow on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object. he holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those tattoos together }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{into the light i command thee! into the light i command thee!}
<A>__{it takes every ounce of john's life force to keep this spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light becomes that familiar shape of wings.}
<C>__{voice of man }
<D>__{your ego is astounding.}
<A>__{john strains to see the shadow become the real thing the majestic wings of an angel.}
<C>__{john}

<A>__{gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around john.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you've had it too easy for too long.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so what's a few thousand years of pain, right?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you never deserved to be blessed. you've all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely unconditional love from your creator.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and that just bugs the shit out of you.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's not your fault. like the animals you are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded. pleasure has no lasting effect. but subject you to pain, unpleasantness suffering and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your redemption. that is when you're at your best.}
<A>__{angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're trying to teach us a lesson?}
<C>__{gabriel}

<B>__{physical therapy room}
<A>__{gabriel turns back to angela. he approaches her his rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her pulling her in. those eyes of his could melt dracula. corridor john can't even stand, let alone save the girl. or humanity. it would be so easy to give up. to roll over and die. but instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long time.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{... i know i'm not one of your favorites... i'm not even allowed in your house these days... but i could use a little attention...}
<A>__{john waits for nothing. his body crumples, his cheek landing flat against the tile. glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. as he stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea. physical therapy room angela's eyes begin to quiver. the color drains. blackness is waiting. corridor john slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of mirror. physical therapy room angela's posture begins to change. mammon's form ripples through her starts to push out through her skin. gabriel stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(whispering to her)}
<D>__{cross the bridge to your destiny...}
<A>__{corridor john pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar. he pauses a beat, closes his eyes. stay on his face as he makes one swift slice movement. but he's in a rush here makes that same motion across his other wrist as well. with both wrists purging his life away, john settles back into the corner and waits for the inevitable.}

<A>__{all we're left with is a distant metallic drone, like the reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago. john lies in that dim half light. motionless. something starts to swirl near him and just like that, john is no longer alone. shadow falls over his pathetic form.}
<C>__{satan }
<D>__{the time has come at last to collect your soul.}
<A>__{john pries his eyes open...}

<C>__{satan}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd make the same mistake twice.}

<C>__{satan}
<D>__{you didn't, did you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{... so how's your son?}

<D>__{he has the spear of destiny.}
<A>__{satan didn't know that. now he's concerned. he studies this dying man.}

<D>__{this is another one of your cons.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{go look for yourself...}
<A>__{satan is still suspicious.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds?}

<C>__{satan }
<D>__{gabriel?}
<A>__{gabriel looks up spots him in the room. gabriel reacts pulls the spear toward her with all his might but satan is faster angela vanishes and gabriel has now pierced dead air. satan holds angela tight covering her mouth like john did. she struggles and the demon inside appears reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on the floor. hideous. the real mammon.}
