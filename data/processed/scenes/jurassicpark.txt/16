<L>__{int extraction room, laboratory}
<A>__{a technician carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine pointed drill. with a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto his eyes and he starts up the drill. hammond yells over the loud whirr.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{the extraction room speaks for itself.}
<A>__{close on drillbit boring into the amber. orange fleck fly.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it does?}
<A>__{the technician shuts the drill. placing his hands into a mounted pair of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle nose pliers to carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito. he drops this bug on a slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{that's a million year old mosquito?}
<A>__{a conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the next technician. the group follows. this technician puts the first slide under a microscope. grant watches on a video monito r as the tech inserts a long needle into the prehistoric bug.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out. right?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{right. you are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect. if this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a t rex we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo dna, the how to build instruction book of an extinct creature. so you see, ellie, i'm not creating dino saurs. fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back. i'm helping them escape from the confined of time.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{but even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete dna strand.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{right you are, dr. grant! more like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of dna. and without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur.}
