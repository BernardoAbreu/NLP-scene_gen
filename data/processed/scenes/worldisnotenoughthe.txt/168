<L>__{exterior interior control centre continuous}
<A>__{five body bags are being carried out by soldiers. m surveys the scene; in an unlit corridor christmas jones and several men sweep the area with clicking geiger counters. elektra is a distance away, listening to a turkish policeman explain what's happening. she nods acknowledgement to m. tanner senses that bond wants to talk to m alone:}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{i will see how they're coming with the power...}
<A>__{they watch him go. m turns to bond:}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{you had your hand on the bomb and you let renard get away with it.}
<A>__{he draws her away, to a small alcove. takes something out of his jacket...the locator card.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{the report king bought. it's a manual. renard's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{then robert was right about a russian connection.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{they're getting their weapons from the russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? i can't help thinking...the person close to king, the one who switched that pin...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{the inside man?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{is maybe...the inside woman.}
<A>__{now the lights power up, disrupt the intimacy and intensity of their exchange. the room is lined with monitors and a huge satellite map of the pipeline's meandering path.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{a woman?}
<A>__{but before he can speak, elektra calls out, gesturing to a dim light flashing on a console in front of her.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{that's not right.}
<A>__{a technician comes over. tanner too, followed by bond and m.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{it's an observation and repair rig. travels along the pipe, checks for broken seals. but it's not supposed to be there.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{stop it.}
<A>__{the technician flicks two switches. the light continues to flash. confused, he tries others. no change.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{where is the rig?}
<A>__{harried, the technician activates the wall schematic of the pipeline. a pulse of light travels along the line. and with it, a sense of horror descends...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{the parcel's in the post.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{it's heading for the oil terminal.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{where it can do the most damage.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{my god.}
<P>__{(to one of her men)}
<D>__{have the terminal evacuated.}
<A>__{the man gets on the phone...}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(to tech)}
<D>__{speed?}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{full on. seventy miles an hour.}
<A>__{he punches buttons. christmas has come, stands next to bond.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{one hundred and six miles from the terminal.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(quick)}
<D>__{it'll reach the other end in seventy eight minutes.}
<P>__{(to tech)}
<D>__{any more of these rigs?}
<A>__{the technician checks his records, looks up, nods.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{there's one parked in the passageway ahead of it.}
<A>__{decisive, christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{i will need some help...}
<A>__{her ida colleagues look sheepish. bond moves to her.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{for just a moment, christmas looks wary:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{unless you'd like to see my id first.}
<A>__{she almost smiles. m nods to tanner to follow them. bond doesn't look at elektra. but she watches him go...}
