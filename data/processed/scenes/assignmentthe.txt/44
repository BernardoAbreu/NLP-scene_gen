<L>__{interior officers' club naval base norfolk evening}
<A>__{the officers' club is decked out for a reception for admiral crawford. all the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a navy string quartet plays softly in b.g. there is a reception line and the admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line.}
