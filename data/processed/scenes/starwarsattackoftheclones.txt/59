<L>__{exterior naboo, mountain meadow later afternoon}
<A>__{padme and anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. at a distance, a herd of shaaks graze contentedly. beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. several other lakes stretch to the horizon. the warm air is full of little floating puffballs. they sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. padme is picking flowers.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{they only work on the weak minded. you are anything but weak minded.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{all right... his name was palo. i was twelve. we were both in the legislative youth program. he was a few years older then i... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{all right, i get the picture... whatever happened to him?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i went on to become a queen. he went on to become an artist.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{maybe he was the smart one.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you really don't like politicians, do you?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i like two or three, but i'm not really sure about one of them.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i don't think the system works.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{how would you have it work?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{that is exactly what we do. the trouble is that people don't wlways agree. in fact, they hardly ever do.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{then they should be made to.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{by whom? who's going to make them?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i don't know. someone.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{of course not me.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{but someone.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{someone wise.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.}
<A>__{a mischievious little grin creeps across his face.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{well, if it works...}
<A>__{padme stares at anakin. he looks back at her, straight faced, and can't hold a smile.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you're making fun of me.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{on no, i'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you're so bad!}
<A>__{padme picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. he catches it. padme throws two more pieces of fruit, and anakin catches them.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{you're always so serious. always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.}
<A>__{anakin then starts to juggle the fruit. padme laughs and throws more fruit at him. he manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. they both laugh. anakin stands in front of a shaak, yelling at it and waving his arms. padme starts laughing as anakin runs in circles, chased by the shaak. the shaak crosses in front of padme. anakin is riding it, facing the shaak's tail. the shaak bucks, and anakin falls off. padme laughs even harder. anakin lies still. padme jumps uip and runs to where anakin is face down in the grass. she turns him over. he is pulling a stupid face at her. she yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. he catches her arm. she struggles. they roll over in the grass. suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. they let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away. anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her. she take it. he pulls her up. and now they are easy together, not self conscious any more. padme scrambles up onto the shaak behind anakin. she puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. abajub digs his heels in. the shaak starts forward, and they ride away.}
