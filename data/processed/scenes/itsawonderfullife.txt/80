<L>__{interior granville house night}
<B>__{close shot george enters}
<A>__{the house is carpetless, empty the rain and wind cause funny noises upstairs. a huge fire is burning in the fireplace. near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered with a checkered oil cloth. it is set for two. a bucket with ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a bowl of caviar. two small chickens are impaled on a spit over the fire. a phonograph is playing on a box, and a string from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit. the phonograph is playing "song of the islands." mary is standing near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked. she is smiling at george, who has been slowly taking in the whole set up. through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed, over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie. ernie exits and closes the door.}
