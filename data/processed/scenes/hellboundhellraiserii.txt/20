<L>__{exterior carnival night}
<A>__{we are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. on either side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked doors and tarpaulin draped entrances deny. a light rain is falling. a huge wooden cut out of a grinning clown dominates one stall while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole place; lots 'o' fun. another has a banner proclaiming freak show, with the subheading you'll gasp at the geek! on the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height while beyond them impossibly huge oil drums squat against the moon bright but cloudy sky. into shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, tiffany. tiffany is a girl in her early teens but looks younger then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over delicate features. for the last months, tiffany has been finding ways out of the institute and making her way here, where she has one special obsession, which we will soon see. following her into shot, but many yards behind, come two interns from the institute. they contrast each other almost comically, one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner. they're not quite the stan and ollie of the medical world but with some serious rehearsal they could get there.}
<D>__{1st intern oh, jesus she's gonna make it.}
<A>__{even as the first intern says this, we see tiffany make a sharp left turn into a stall entrance.}
