<A>__{the pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room nyah's back to ethan:}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(grimly amused)}
<D>__{not that it matter much but..i seem to recall you staying something like, 'i was hoping we could work together.'}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{this wasn't what i had in mind, nyah.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{but it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..}
<A>__{she approaches ethan. they're inches apart.}
<C>__{nyah }
<D>__{come on, out with it. tell me to go and insinuate myself back into sean's life.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{go and insinuate yourself back into sean's life.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{i'd like a little more conviction..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so would i. but it's not mine to give.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(archness there)}
<D>__{you've either got it or you don't. let your conscience be your guide?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{with a smile and a wink.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{but i don't have a conscience. i'm a bloody thief.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you can be a thief and have a conscience.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{no. you can be a thief and have a conscience: not me. why did you have to tell me about this!}
<P>__{(pouring herself a drink)}
<D>__{what do i have to do to get away from this guy? when you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now i will be at some out of the way place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does. and it looks like he's done it again. you know his definition of a true paranoid?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{someone in possession of all the facts.}
<P>__{(she turns away, pauses)}
<D>__{are you telling me i have to do this?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{generally, i don't favor coercing someone. not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{and that's the only reason?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{can you think of a better one?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{not me. i was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{look, would it make you feel better if i didn't want you to do this?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{much.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{then feel better!..}
<A>__{long moment while she looks at him.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{well. that made all the difference in the world, didn't it?}
<A>__{ethan walks out onto the balcony. she looks at his back.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo hoo i'm not nad' message. not after the way we broke up.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what wouldn't make him suspicious?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{probably that i needed him in some urgent way..destitute in serious trouble..the kind i couldn't possible sort out myself..}
<A>__{ethan's been smiling slightly.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{serious trouble, nyah, is something i can always arrange..}
<B>__{nyah in a spanish jail}
<A>__{standing for front and side mug shot. o.s. sound of teletype continues. superimpose: ethan holding up something the size of a dime:}

<A>__{on the screen of the gps computer, a little yellow blip appears pulsating on the screen.}
<C>__{ethan's voice}
<D>__{when it's in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world.}
