<D>__{in early september, mom and dad got a call from the annandale police notifying them that chris' abandoned car had been identified by the arizona highway patrol after a group of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert. there were no signs that chris had intended to return to it. but there wasn't any evidence of struggle. the police said they thought chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him. nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that chris was actually trying not to be found.}
