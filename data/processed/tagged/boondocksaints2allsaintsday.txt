<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{what is the fed's interest in this?}
<A>__{the detectives harden, brick wall. eunice furrows her brow.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{their interest, detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of boston's finest criminals. y'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them. the fbi tends to take exception to such things. they coulda sent anyone. they sent me. why do you think that is?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, since we've broken the "fuck barrier," allow me to be blunt.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{it is because i am so fucking smart that i make smart people feel like retards. now, we seem to be getting off on the wrong foot here. i'd appreciate a bit of cooperation. let's chalk it up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend. a man who taught me everything i know.}

<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{all their vics were criminals. clearly not the case here. so, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction. no need for federal involvement so with all due respect...we'll see you later, special agent bloom.}
<A>__{eunice stands right in front of dolly.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{man, i hate it when people say that. "with all due respect." because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark. i will give you an example. with all due respect, detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction i fuckin' say it does.}
