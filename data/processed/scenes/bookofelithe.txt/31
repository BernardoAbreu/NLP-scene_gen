<A>__{a violent commotion is heard from down the hall. suddenly one of carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is thrown hard into a wall and slumps to the floor, unconscious. eli storms into the box, pissed. more guards rush in behind him. carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off as he stands to greet eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.}

<D>__{i knew you'd reconsider.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah? how'd you know that?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{none of the walkers i've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. i mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half fried from eating each other it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. but i never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered.}

<D>__{so you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{engineer? i don't know what you're talking about. if there's something wrong, maybe i can help.}
<A>__{carnegie is a practiced liar. much more difficult to read.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{this is redridge. he's kind of my right hand man around here.}
<A>__{redridge one of the two men who chased eli into the room steps forward. he regards eli with a distrustful eye.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{he'll show you to your room.}
