<L>__{exterior. scrapyard dusk}
<A>__{the porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of light and shadow. ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a cigarette. his visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the pack. lincoln steps out and takes one. ozzie lights it for him }
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{yer girlfriend sure is pretty.}
<A>__{his visitor looks at him curiously. ozzie misinterprets that he's said something out of turn. time to change the subject }
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{so what's with them tattoos, huh?}
<A>__{he taps his forehead. lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly aware of it now and suspicious of the question. ozzie palliates }
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{hey , in the eye of the beholder, right? now this place, this is beautiful to me. this is my place. i own it. `may not look like much but you'd be surprised. c'mon, lemme show you...}
<A>__{ozzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. lincoln hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along.}
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{m o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial scrap. comes in from all over. easy way round the recyclin' l a w s . me, i sell it on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown. other stuff, i pick up at the scrap markets. fix it up, `fetches a price.}
<A>__{the y reach a vehicle shell. a rust pocked chassis, canted on its axle, we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era.}
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{fossil fuel transport. this piece o' junk's a collector's item. all that age of the wheel nostalgia, "elegant era of transport" bullshit. i find the parts, she's as good as solid gold.}
<A>__{ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile. steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables.}
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{now this here's got a colorful history. came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker out in the valley. `got shut down way back. then this new outfit took over, stripped the place out. i guess they're doin' s o m e more remodelling cause i just had `em in again the other day...}
<P>__{( a tug of smoke, reflective)}
<D>__{hump`n dump crew. nice fellas.}
<A>__{lincoln frowns. the term is familiar. the taste of smoke, a hinterior but his memory has been clouded by trauma. ozzie reads his face }
<C>__{ozzie}
<D>__{you okay there?}
<A>__{lincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. a sense of danger, indistinct. suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i'm going to check on my friend.}
