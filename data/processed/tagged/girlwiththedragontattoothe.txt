<L>__{exterior stockholm evening}
<A>__{snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the christmas lights in the trees. the beauty of her city pleases salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto blomkvist's street. she parks. gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building. from around the corner ahead, blomkvist and erika appear. he says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf. salander stops mid stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again they're not inside. they've stopped just outside the building's entrance. they're embracing. and the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at salander. finally they separate, but only to allow blomkvist to unlock the door. erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside. salander can't move. waits for the pain to subside which it eventually does but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness. then that subsides, replaced with a facade of insouciance. the richest girl in sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster climbs onto her honda starts it and drives off probably forever.}
