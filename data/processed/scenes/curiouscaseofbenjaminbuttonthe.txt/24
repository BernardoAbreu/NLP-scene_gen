<A>__{thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the large old moldering antebellum houses...}
<L>__{exterior the back of an old new orleans house night, 1918}
<A>__{he comes to an old three story house with a screened porch, voices from inside... people talking and laughing... the baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself stops its mournful cry. thomas stops, catching his breath... he looks in through the back porch... the sounds of voices coming... thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps. he takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the baby's blanket... we can just see the figures of two people coming from inside... thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... and his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind.}
<C>__{a woman's }
<D>__{i could've sworn i heard somebody knockin'...}
<A>__{when a young black woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch... a thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer she's known as queenie. she's followed by a handsome black man, mr. weathers that everyone calls tizzy. she looks out the door, and not seeing anything...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{i guess not...}
<A>__{she stands for a moment taking in the night air...}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{the air smells sweet...}
<A>__{and she sings to herself... a song from the time...}
<C>__{tizzy}
<D>__{you look very handsome tonight, ms. queenie, handsome as i ever seen you... the green matches your eyes...}
<C>__{queenie}
<P>__{(fingering dress)}
<D>__{it isn't everyday a war's over, mr. weathers...}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{we have to mark it somehow... you ain't no slouch yourself.}
<A>__{he smiles, tips his hat... and they stand in the quiet...}
<C>__{tizzy}
<D>__{hambert's back in town... came home legless, but he home... we're gonna throw a party for him... help get himself situated...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know you was sweet on him one time...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{sweeter than i shoulda been... lost his legs you say? "you never know what's comin' for you."}
<A>__{and if right on cue an older white woman sticks her head out...}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{ms. simone messed herself...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{she got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her... i will be right there, mrs. jameson...}
<A>__{the woman disappears inside. queenie, not anxious to go...}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{it sure is nice out here, mr. weathers...}
<C>__{tizzy}
<D>__{awful nice, ms. queenie... come out back for a moment... take your mind away from things...}
<A>__{he pushes open the porch screen door...}
<C>__{queenie}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{just a moment's time...}
<A>__{he offers her his hand... she takes it... he backs out of the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right on top of the baby... the baby wails, tizzy stumbles, nearly falls...}
<C>__{tizzy}
<D>__{what in god's name...?!!}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{what is that? a fish crawl out of the river...?}
<A>__{she moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{god in heaven!}
<A>__{it is the very first time we have seen the baby. what we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian. indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad eyed old man...}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{my goodness, the lord did something here...!}
<C>__{tizzy}
<D>__{look like a milk wagon run over it... three times... and back...}
<A>__{and they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...}
<C>__{tizzy }
<D>__{i didn't see it layin' there... i hope i didn't hurt it none... steppin' on it like that...}
<A>__{the baby won't stop its mournful cry...}
<C>__{tizzy }
<D>__{we best leave it to the police... i will go }
<A>__{queenie hesitates... a longing.}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{it's for sure nobody wanted to keep it...}
<A>__{and making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying baby, taking it inside... tizzy, anxiously whispering something, going in after her...}
