<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{jacob stops in front of the apartment door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. it comes back with a key. he inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. he calls out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello. it's me.}
<L>__{interior sarah's apartment night}
<A>__{some lights are on. the apartment looks comfortable and cozy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello? is anybody home? jed? eli? daddy's here.}
<A>__{there is still no answer. jacob is surprised. he peers into the dark living room and then walks to the kitchen. no one is around. a photo of jacob, sarah, and their boys is sitting on the counter. he picks it up and carries it with him through the apartment. he walks into his old bedroom and then into the boys' room. the beds are still unmade. there is no one home. he sees his image in the bathroom mirror and turns away in disgust. he walks back to the living room. he is about to switch the lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall. he calls out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sarah, is that you? i hope you don't mind. i needed to come home.}
<A>__{jacob is startled to see jezzie enter the room. she does not seem he usual self. she appears larger, more imposing.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{hello, jake. i knew you'd come here in the end.}
<A>__{jacob is nervous.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what're you ... ? where's sarah? where are the boys?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{sit down, jake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{sit down.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no! what's going on? where's my family?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{it's over, jake. it's all over.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where have they gone?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{wake up. stop playing with yourself. it's finished.}
<A>__{jezzie stares at jacob with a frightening, powerful glare. the edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. it is an innocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into something else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing. jacob's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. his legs are shaking.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{your capacity for self delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.}
<A>__{jezzie begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him. something about her walk is very unnatural. jacob eyes her fearfully. in the darkness jezzie's movements become increasingly strange and elusive. we see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only to reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room. jacob spins around, confused. suddenly jezzie is inches from his face, although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. her movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what's wrong, jake?}
<P>__{(she mocks him)}
<D>__{forget to take your antidote?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who are you? what are you doing to me?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you have quite a mind, jake. i loved your friends. that chemist the ladder. what an imagination you have!}
<A>__{jacob freezes.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and your vision of paradise ... fantastic! you're a real dreamer, you know that? only it's time to wake up.}
<A>__{jezzie has disappeared in the darkness of the room. only the sounds of flapping wings remain. they grow louder and more menacing, whooshing past him with no visible source.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your mind is crumbling, jake. no more "army." no more conspiracies. you're dying, dr. singer. it's over.}
<A>__{jacob, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out. "jezzie" laughs.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where's to run, jacob? where's to go?}
<A>__{jacob pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{how many times have you asked me that? how many times?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{tell me, damn you!}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(with consummate power)}
<D>__{you know who i am.}
<A>__{jezzie appears from the shadows. her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. then, to jacob's horror, she turns around. he is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before. glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable. its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration. its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering. jacob pulls away from it, overhwelmed by confusion. he is rooted in fear. a sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing jacob's hair straight up. it is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. he can barely stand. he struggles to pull himself away. the flapping sound returns, charging at him from all directions. it is as if the darkness itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(whispering to himself)}
<D>__{this isn't happening.}
<A>__{new terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. guns fire and explode past his head. it is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him. jacob yells but his own voice is lost in the melee. terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help. suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance. it is louis. jacob is shocked to hear him. he stands motionless.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{if you're frightened of dying you'll see devils tearing you apart. if you've made your peace then they're angels freeing you from the world.}
<A>__{the voice fades. jacob just stands there, not sure what to do. and then the sounds return. only now they are more terrifying than ever. hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying. jacob looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. all the sounds seem to emenate from it. the more jacob stares at it the louder they become. after a moment, jacob takes a huge breath. we sense a great resolve forming inside him. then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it. new and more terrifying noises assault jacob, attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped. he continues walking toward the creature. in the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. it rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic regularity. doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. the room itself seems like an organic presence. it is alive, angry, and threatening. the creature sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself. it writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury. jacob, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it. as the camera draws closer to the creature's head the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. it is like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness. with superhuman effort jacob grabs hold of the creature. it is like grabbing hold of a live wire. his body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. he is flying in all directions but does not let go. his fingers claw at the creature's head. jacob struggles defiantly with the monster. suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{who do you think you're fighting!}
<A>__{jacob does not respond. it cries out again.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you're fighting?}
<A>__{deep inside the darkness jacob begins to make out the presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. it looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face. it is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask. jacob digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.}
