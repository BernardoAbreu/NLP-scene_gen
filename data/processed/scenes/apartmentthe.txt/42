<L>__{interior chinese restaurant evening}
<A>__{the bar is a long, narrow, dimly lit room with booths along one side. beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room, which does not concern us. the place is decorated in early beachcomber style rattan, fish nets, conch shells, etc. the help is chinese. at this early hour, there are only half a dozen customers in the place all at the bar except for one man, sitting in the last booth with his back toward camera. at a piano, a chinese member of local 808 is improvising mood music. fran comes through the door, and without looking around, heads straight for the last booth. the bartender nods to her they know her there. as she passes the piano player, he gives her a big smile, segues into jealous lover. fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth.}

<D>__{i never said goodbye, fran.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(not listening)}
<D>__{for a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven fourteen to white plains. so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee and you sit there by yourself and you think and it all begins to look so ugly }
<A>__{there are tears in her eyes. she breaks off, downs what's left of the daiquiri.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{how do you think i felt riding home on that seven fourteen train?}
