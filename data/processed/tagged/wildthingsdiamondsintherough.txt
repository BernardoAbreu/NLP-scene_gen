<L>__{interior museum day}
<A>__{a perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless diamonds, glinting in the morning sun. tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble museum hall. the stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. marie clifford's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds... she reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels. it's of a mother cradling her baby daughter...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{today's the day, mom...}
<C>__{curator }
<D>__{you here again, marie?}
<A>__{marie spins round, sees the bespectacled curator, 60's, standing behind her.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{just leaving.}
<A>__{marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case... 'the mother daughter diamonds...'}
<L>__{exterior museum day}
<A>__{marie fires up her powerful bmw, parked right outside the austere museum building. the powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds fluttering skywards... credits appear over... ariel footage of a narrow highway, marie's bmw streaking through the endless tract of florida wetlands. in the water, gators, warm themselves in the early morning sun... moving over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical birds stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening airboats... through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing and into the town of blue bay, where the nip tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club. marie steers her bmw into the showroom like parking lot of blue bay high school.}
<L>__{interior marie's bmw morning}
<A>__{marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when... scccreeeeccchhhh! she slams on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car. almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt. she sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from the front bumper of the bmw. the sudden jolt has changed the radio station. a newscaster rambles on...}

<C>__{radio newscaster }
<D>__{blue bay police detective michael morrison was able to recover over $400,000 in stolen money, but the suspect, described as female, between eighteen and thirty, remains at large...}
<A>__{marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo, then leans out of the car window.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i'm... so... sorry...}
<A>__{elena smiles wryly.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you will be.}
<A>__{and she means it...}
<L>__{interior blue bay high auditorium morning}
<A>__{the auditorium is packed with the blue bay high student body. the natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back. marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(handing over a present)}
<D>__{happy birthday, babe. they ain't diamonds, but you're just gonna have to wait for those...}
<A>__{marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of opal earrings.}
<C>__{marie}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you so much...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{are you ok, hon?}
<A>__{marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the freaks and geeks crowd round elena, worshipping her like the goddess she is...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i...yeah...i will be fine...it's just...that new girl...i almost hit her in the parking lot...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you mean the towel girl, the one who transferred in? jesus, she's trouble. you know the only reason she's slinging towels is 'cos it's court ordered...}
<A>__{marie and elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea of hormonally challenged students as principal lionel mosster, his ill fitting sports jacket coffee stained, steps onstage.}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{we're here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you.}
<A>__{he pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{national studies report sexual activity among students at an all time high.}
<A>__{the students all cheer, naturally.}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{we'll see who's cheering when you've got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or get slapped with a paternity suit...or arrested for date rape. but don't take my word for it...}
<A>__{he motions behind him to kristen richards, early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and chad borman, late 20s, devilishly handsome...}
<C>__{principal mosster}
<D>__{miss richards and dr. borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand...}
<A>__{kristen steps up to the lectern.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{good morning, my name is kristen richards. i'm an officer for the miami juvenile parole board, as some of you already know...}
<A>__{quick glance at elena who rolls her eyes...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{but that's not what brings me here today. when i heard about principal mosster's sex education program i thought i'd volunteer my own personal story, in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes i made. back in high school all i wanted to do was get drunk, stoned and laid...}
<A>__{the students roar their approval.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{by my junior year, my life was a blur of cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every night of the week...}
<A>__{elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(through fake coughs)}
<D>__{...whore...}
<A>__{kristen ignores the slur.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{and then, one night at some pathetic frat party, someone slipped a roofie in my drink...and raped me.}
<A>__{this quiets the auditorium.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{there isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't crawl when i think of the violation and humiliation i endured. i can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong headed choices i did, you'll be seeing dr. borman...}
<A>__{chad steps to the podium.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{thank you, miss richards. my name's dr. chad borman. i run the forensics lab at the police department, where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders. most teens like ms. richards never get their lives together. the physical scars may go away, but the emotional damage stays forever.}
<A>__{while chad drones on, muddy, a gremlin eyed drooler, sitting in front of elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up on the back of the chair. he spots the ugly plastic bracelet locked around one of her ankles.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{that's not...what i think it is, is it?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{whattchya think it is, bitch?}
<A>__{the words catch in his throat.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{one of them...parole leashes...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{bingo.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{so you can't, like, go more than ten miles from the cop shop?}
<A>__{elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{five. i got someone's panties in a bunch.}
<A>__{back at the podium, chad leans forward, making sure his words resonate with the student body.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{and as for the perpetrators of this heinous act, even if you are still a minor, you will be tried as an adult, and, if convicted, you will do hard time.}
<A>__{he pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{are there any questions?}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{yeah, i got one for miss richards.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{ask away.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{when they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right?}
<A>__{kristen is taken aback by elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{uh, no, actually, i was never able to make a positive id. all i remember was his alcohol soaked breath whispering in my ear, "you won't remember, but you'll never forget..."}
<A>__{elena cracks a sideways grin...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{so what you're really saying is you fucked for free...}
<A>__{kristen has no answer to that. principal mosster does his best to control the situation...}
<C>__{principal mosster}
<D>__{miss sandoval. you're on thin ice, young lady!}
<A>__{like elena cares. she leans back, nods. job done.}
<L>__{exterior blue bay high diving pool day}

<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{blue bay high school would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri county region...}
<A>__{breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area. but all eyes are on the home team. masturbatory fantasies abound as the blue bay girls' diving team runs through stretches... and as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet marie, stunning in her nearly see through white bathing suit.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{first up, district champion marie clifford...}
<A>__{the crowd cheers, watching marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above. jenny right behind, waits on the ladder... jay clifford, marie's chisel jawed stepfather in his late thirties, focuses a digital video camera on marie from the front row of the bleachers...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{c'mon now baby, you can do it...}
<A>__{marie just rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team.}
<A>__{marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices the incongruous figure of elena, sidling up to him...}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to marie)}
<D>__{just try to keep those legs together.}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{shouldn't be a problem for miss teen virgin.}
<A>__{jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the world's hottest towel girl...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you're mr. clifford, right? as in clifford construction?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i am, yes, but...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i'd love to see one of your erections...}
<A>__{whoa. jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air. it's a spectacular sight as the beautiful marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near perfect form. she quickly resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to jay.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{nice take off, gotta work on the landing...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i can't do any better...}
<A>__{jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no such word as 'can't. now do it again. only better...}
<A>__{marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. as she's about to start the arduous climb, elena hands her a towel...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{bet you choke.}
<A>__{stops marie in her tracks.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what's your major malfunction?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{just wanted to make a wager. between best friends.}
<A>__{marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you blow this dive, i get those diamonds of yours.}
<A>__{marie stops, looks down on elena from the fifth rung of the ladder, shakes her head...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{how'd you know about my inheritance?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{talk of the town, birthday girl. today's the day, right?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{and what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when i win?}
<A>__{elena thinks for a second, glances back at jay with a big smile.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i will stay away from your stepfather. you make it, i won't be your new stepmom anytime soon. whattya say?}
<A>__{marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{take your sorry ass back to the swamps.}
<A>__{she ascends the ladder, leaving elena behind...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{choke!}
<A>__{marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on the task at hand. but can't help but notice her nemesis below, walking slowly, seductively, up to jay, intoxicating him... marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop looming beyond... she slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. it's an odd design. four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a diamond... she throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, marie is airborne... she twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty. thank god this is in slow motion. and as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash. marie surfaces to roaring applause. treading water, she can't help but watch her jay's smiling face in the bleachers...}
<L>__{exterior clifford mansion afternoon}
<A>__{sickeningly expensive powerboats and de rigged schooners line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the clifford mansion... banners and streamers wishing marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds. partygoers soak in the blazing florida sun, sip at non alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff raff on the mainland... marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9.7?}
<A>__{marie forces a smile.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{nah. i'm cool.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{denial ain't just a river in egypt, babe. you got diamonds on the mind.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{have either of you seen my video camera?}
<A>__{marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to jay's face.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i had it at the dive meet, i'm sure...}
<A>__{he shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ladies, gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to marie, on her eighteenth birthday.}
<A>__{everyone raises their fine crystal.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{she's become every inch of the woman her mother hoped she'd be. wherever she is now, julie's looking down and smiling.}
<A>__{tears well in marie's eyes...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, marie, i know your mother wanted you to have...}
<A>__{he notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well dressed men standing at the entrance to his house. whoever they are, jay's instantly unnerved. he stumbles over his words...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{... she wanted you to have... a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends.}
<A>__{he glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{please excuse me.}
<A>__{... and hurries after them. marie is left dumbfounded. so close, but so far...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jay! what about my present?}
<A>__{she chases after him...}
<L>__{interior clifford mansion hallway day}
<A>__{marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the opulent clifford mansion, past framed family photos, of jay, marie and the late julie...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jay?}
<A>__{he's nowhere to be found. frustrated, marie finds herself alone in the kitchen. she angrily selects a bottle of champagne, pops the cork. before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{it simply can't be done...}
<A>__{marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway, and down towards jay's study...}
<D>__{jay (o.s.) (cont'd) in all construction there's delays.}
<A>__{marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. what she sees makes the blood run cold in her veins... an imposing cuban businessman, mr. barajas, stands threateningly over a visibly frightened jay. another man, cicatriz, dressed in designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn of this little operation.}
<C>__{mr. barajas}
<D>__{four months is not a delay. it's a disaster.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you have my word, mr. barajas, the building is almost finished. just give me a week, two tops.}
<A>__{barajas nods to cicatriz, who moves in on jay with lightning quickness, holds a razor sharp knife against his thumb.}
<C>__{mr. barajas}
<D>__{we are long past the negotiation stage.}
<A>__{cicatriz runs the steel blade across jay's thumb. marie has to cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood stain the spotless white carpet.}
<C>__{mr. barajas }
<D>__{for every day the building goes unfinished, we'll take a finger...}
<A>__{a sinister grin stretches across cicatriz's lips.}
<C>__{cicatriz}
<D>__{pray, mr. clifford, you finish before the eleventh day...}
<A>__{and with that the cuban men head to the door. marie scrambles away, her heart pounding... she's halfway down the hallway when mr. barajas and cicatriz exit jay's study. she turns, tries to look innocent as the cuban 'businessmen' stare her down. jay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{marie! shouldn't you be with your friends?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i was just...}
<A>__{cicatriz takes a step towards her.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to marie)}
<D>__{i will be right there. with your gift... just... wait outside, ok?}
<A>__{marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating cuban men...}
<L>__{exterior clifford mansion afternoon}
<A>__{marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi clad partygoers, in a daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne. jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost sheep with open arms.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{so? did you get the key? are you blue bay's richest bitch?}
<A>__{marie's thoughts are drowned out by the roar of a powerful engine. all attention turns to a rusted motorcycle as it streaks across the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of mud in its wake. and atop the bike... elena, in skintight leathers.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{holy shit, who invited her?}
<A>__{marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. elena brings the bike to a screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. the ultimate partycrasher...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{this is a private party...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{don't mind me. i ain't here for your stupid party.}
<A>__{she's striding towards the mansion, towards jay who's standing at the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{get the hell outta here! now!}
<A>__{marie stumbles after elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her back. there's a tense moment before...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{damn girl, whattcha been drinking?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{stay away from my stepfather!}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{make me...}
<A>__{and that's it. marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. connects on elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. but it's ignited the street fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming into marie and together they tumble to the ground... the crowds gather to watch the cat fight, in equal parts appalled and aroused. it's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing wrestling match, no holds barred. the drunken marie has the upper hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<A>__{and that stops the fight right there and then. marie looks up to see a red faced jay standing over her.}
<C>__{marie}

<A>__{elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.}

<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{not enough. just not enough...}

<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hello? anyone there?}
<A>__{he swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light... finally jay lowers the weapon. it looks like he might collapse, until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{fuck me...}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{any time. any place...}
<A>__{he reels around, sees elena moving toward him, brushing aside the thick plastic sheeting. she has a bottle of beer in one hand, a video camera in the other. jay's video camera to be precise...}

<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{elena}

<C>__{jay}
<D>__{gimme the camera back...}
<A>__{elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. keeps the camera trained on his worried face...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{come get it.}
<A>__{jay's reaching his elastic limit. he reaches for the camera, but elena won't let go. they wrestle for control of the video camera. and finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across the room and shatters on the concrete floor...}

<C>__{jay }
<D>__{poor detective morrison. it's hard to do that to a friend. especially one going through such a nasty divorce.}
<A>__{they look up to see jay, standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived. and then along came a spider...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{a black widow.}
<A>__{jay glances at elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{more like widows... gotta say i was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff marie, but you know what, i'm over the bitch...}
<A>__{elena suddenly gets to her feet.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you want me to top you off?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that'd be fine, just fine.}
<A>__{he hands elena his empty glass, then kisses kristen tenderly. when they break...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{she's got a good head on her shoulders.}
<A>__{kristen doesn't reply. just smiles, watches elena over by the outside bar, mixing jay's drink...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you two got me out of a mountain of shit, i will tell you that. craziest goddamn scheme i've ever heard of. but hell, you played it perfectly.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{my job was easy. it was elena who had to keep it all together...}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{we've had some practice along the way...}
<A>__{jay turns around, smiles at elena as she holds out his drink.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{here you go, mr. clifford.}
<A>__{jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off to the swimming pool.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, all that nasty business, it's behind us. forever. from here on out, it's the good life.}
<A>__{he starts to climb the high dive. when he gets to the top, he looks down at elena and kristen, smiles.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you two look so good, it's difficult to tell which one's the mother and which one's the daughter...}
<A>__{kristen calls back up at him.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{that's just the roofies talking...}
<A>__{says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for jay to register the sinister implications...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{his eyes are blood shot. he starts to sway atop the high dive.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{delta chi, class of '88. hellova party. i'd never really tasted cocktails like that.}
<A>__{jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't...whattya talking about?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{it was like being awake though an operation. i could feel everything happening, but i couldn't do anything to stop it...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh...shit...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you took something from me that night. but you left something behind...}
<A>__{jay's head is spinning as he looks to kristen, to elena.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{your daughter...}
<A>__{he can't quite get his mind around it. everything's becoming blurry.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't remember...}
<A>__{he looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds... elena and kristen stand side by side below him.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you may not remember...}
<A>__{a broad grin stretches across elena's lips as she finishes...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{...but you'll never forget.}
<A>__{jay tries to take a step forward. he stumbles. tries in vain to regain his balance. it's too late. he falls. 20 feet to the unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{nice take off. gotta work on the landing.}
<A>__{they stand back, watching jay's pancaked body draining its precious blood into the ice blue pool...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{let's go get our money.}
<A>__{they gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson red...}
<B>__{the end}
<A>__{as the credits roll....}
<L>__{interior office morning}
<A>__{an anonymous, luxurious office. a fat, balding, semi conscious man lies curled up on the floor as elena, half undressed and wearing a black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse... there's a crackle on her walkie talkie...}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{we got problems...}
<A>__{from outside, she can hear the wailing of sirens. getting closer.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{almost done here.}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{leave it. come on!}
<A>__{elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure.}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{he gonna be able to make an id?}
<A>__{elena glances at the man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over like a jelly donut.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{not on your life. i gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget.}
<L>__{exterior office morning}
<A>__{elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. the getaway driver...kristen, of course...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i can't believe we just gave up all that cash.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{forget it. the black widow's finally got an angle on our real prey.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{we goin' to blue bay?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{he won't know what hit him.}
<A>__{a smile crosses elena's perfect lips...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{'bout time...}
<A>__{and the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank.}
<L>__{interior team clifford building jay's office day}
<A>__{jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his unfinished office.}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{that's an awful lot of money...}
<A>__{jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who the hell...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{not enough though. gonna need those diamonds if you're gonna ride out this disaster...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what? what the hell do you mean?}
<A>__{kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of marbles. throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards jay... but they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the concrete floor...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{the building's built on a sink hole, jay. you know it, and i know it. gonna need to think fast if you wanna keep the cubans off your back...}
<A>__{jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{how'd you...how'd you know all this...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{it's what we do.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. it's on.}
<L>__{interior locker room day}
<A>__{marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool, looking at her mother's soon to be diamond ring through teary eyes...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i just want what's mine...}
<A>__{elena stalks the bleachers behind her.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{the diamonds are your inheritance. you deserve them...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{my fucking step monster'll never give me the goddamn key...}
<A>__{elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to marie.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{so you take it, one way or another...}
<L>__{interior chad's office day}
<A>__{behind closed doors, chad's completing yet another dubious transaction, handing over a bag of roofies. the buyer this time...marie...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{you take a check?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{money talks, bullshit walks. i got strippers to feed...}
<A>__{marie fishes out the money from her purse.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{how'd you like to make some real cash?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{chad likes the sound of that.}
<A>__{and it's that simple...}
<L>__{interior team clifford building night}
<A>__{chad uses jay's teeth mouldings to bite elena, as marie trains jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{hey, that hurt!}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{shut it, bitch. no pain, no gain...}
<A>__{elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall...}
<L>__{interior blue bay forensics lab night}
<A>__{chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating the audio and video footage.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{we'll put you right here, and...}
<A>__{chad presses play. on the video screen a frightened elena is huddled against the wall.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{c'mon now baby, you can do it...}
<L>__{interior elena's trailer night}
<A>__{elena watches as marie and theo drive away, then turns to the glistening mother daughter diamonds. she opens a case with two identical glass replicas, and replaces the diamonds... all the while, uncle marty snores his head off...}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(to uncle marty, irritated)}
<D>__{will you knock that off? they're gone.}
<A>__{uncle marty's eyes snap open.}
<L>__{exterior beach paradise day}
<A>__{kristen and marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you're blocking our sun...}
<A>__{looks over her sunglasses at...uncle marty...only all cleaned up, in a pair of bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs... he clutches a briefcase...}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{ladies. hellova job back there. your best ever if i might be so bold...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{this is our biggest score. you sure you can move it?}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{not a problem.}
<A>__{kristen nods to the briefcase in uncle marty's hand.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{let's see the green...}
<A>__{uncle marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing stacks of cash...}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{got another lead, if you're interested. was just up in boston, surveying a mansion that's just been sold.}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{termites already eaten most of it. owner's shitting bricks. there's gotta be an angle for the black widows...}
<A>__{kristen and elena look to each other.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{it's over. we had a good run.}
<A>__{uncle marty shrugs.}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{shame. guess all good things come to an end. so, the diamonds...}
<A>__{elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand. hands them over and is about to take the case of money when...}
<C>__{uncle marty}
<D>__{how do i know these are the real thing?}
<A>__{elena looks to kristen. they smile.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you're going to have to trust us...}
<A>__{like fuck.}
<B>__{the end. again.}
