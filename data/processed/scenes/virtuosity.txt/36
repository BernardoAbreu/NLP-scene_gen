<A>__{watching the news on a pocket tv on a wooden bench that morning. both proud and horrified at the monster he has unleashed upon the world. you hear classical music in the background. lindenmeyer begins to laugh. uncontrollably. the sounds echoing. as we pull back, you realize the bench is one of many inside the hollywood bowl. lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. he glances down at the members of the los angeles philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming performance. whatever the event is, it's going to be big. dozens of technicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras, microphones, etc. for a live, payperview broadcast.}
