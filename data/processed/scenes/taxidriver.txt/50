<A>__{travis, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with the television set. he places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate which supports the tv. then, slowly rocking his heel back and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without knocking it over. the tv, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama, rocks back and forth. travis pushes the tv farther and farther until finally the inevitable happens the crate tips backward, sending the portable tv crashing to the floor. there is a short flash and the tv screen turns white. travis, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the tv upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and tries to reactivate the vanished image. travis' efforts are futile; a tube has broken, and the tv will not come back to life.}
