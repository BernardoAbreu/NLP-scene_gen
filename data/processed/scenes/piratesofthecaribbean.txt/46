<L>__{interior governor's mansion morning}
<A>__{will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. calls out:}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{miss swann! elizabeth!}
<A>__{a terrible silence answers him. he spots an overturned chair, fallen bookshelf }
<L>__{interior fort charles norrington's office morning}
<A>__{will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{they've taken her! they've taken elizabeth!}
<A>__{a group stares at him: swann, norrington, and gillette among others, gathered around a map. the map is so large it drapes over the governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{we're aware of the situation.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we have to hunt them down and save her!}
<A>__{swann's worry has made him short tempered.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{where do you propose we start? if you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! if anyone does, tell me!}
<P>__{(will is silent)}
<D>__{leave, mr. turner.}
<A>__{murtogg has remembered something. he ventures it warily:}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{that jack sparrow... he talked about the black pearl.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{mentioned it, is more what he did.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{still }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it!}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{that pirate tried to kill my daughter. we could never trust a word he said!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we could strike a bargain }
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{no. the pirates who invaded this fort left sparrow locked in his cell. ergo, he is not their ally, and therefore of no value.}
<P>__{(through with will)}
<D>__{we will determine their most likely course, and launch a search mission that sails with the tide.}
<A>__{will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's not good enough. this is elizabeth's life!}
<A>__{norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{mr. turner, this is not the time for rash actions.}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves elizabeth.}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{now, go home.}
<A>__{he opens the door, and then turns away. will watches him walk back to the desk. will's face sets in resolve, and he leaves.}
