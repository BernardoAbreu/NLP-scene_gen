<A>__{before einhorn can say a word, he slips away and disappears into his own office. holly pavilion. 8:30 a.m. the score of protesters outside the pavilion still move in an uneven ellipse and shout: "two four! help the poor!" ives, the bespectacled demonstrator who shouted at sundstrom earlier, is removing his sandwich boards and giving them to his replacement. he hurries across the walk and into... holly pavilion, lobby ives cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly up the long corridor leading to the farkis building, unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into... the farkis building, fifth floor ...and comes out, as the elevator opens. this is a laboratory floor, and the corridors are empty except for a white uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young woman in a white smock in the background, who waves to the young man before disappearing into one of the rooms. ives fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own lab. he enters into... farkis building, nephrology lab dingy and cheerless place, as labs go. ives hangs his coat in the cupboard, loosens his tie, unbuttons his suit jacket, squats on a stool, reaches over for a loose file on the work table, opens the file and begins to read the papers inside. a door clicks open behind him, and without looking up, he waves briefly to whoever has entered. camera dollies to full shot of ives frowning over his notes. we are suddenly conscious of a white uniformed presence behind him. we know it's medical personnel, but we can't see the face. ives starts to turn to the presence behind him, when suddenly a small hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head, and he slumps forward, his forehead thumping against the black surface of the lab table.}
