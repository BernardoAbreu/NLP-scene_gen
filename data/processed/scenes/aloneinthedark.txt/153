<A>__{hudgens steps through the doorway. the doorway opens up into a vast cave, hundreds of feet high and wide, stretching off into darkness. the cave walls are rough hewn rock, untouched by human hands. the walls of the cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into the depths of the mountain. hudgens moves into the cave, tentative, but excited. suddenly, there's a scratching, scurrying sound. a xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels. out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph. and a third. across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of individual tunnels. hudgens steps further into the cave. the xenomorphs approach him, their heads darting about. the xenomorphs surround hudgens on all sides. his steps are careful. he reaches his hand out to one of the creatures.}
