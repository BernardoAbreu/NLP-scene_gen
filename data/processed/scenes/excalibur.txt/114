<A>__{the sky is red; so is the steel of excalibur. lancelot awakens and starts at what he sees. his cry stirs guenevere. they are horrified to see excalibur impaled in the ground between their entwined bodies. it has pierced their union without grazing their flesh. they leap up and back away, unable to speak at first.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{why didn't he kill us?}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{he has given up.}
<A>__{she kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{the king without his sword, the land without a king...}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{we are to blame.}
<A>__{lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt. he rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol of his own inner torment. guenevere sinks to the ground next to lancelot's empty armor and his abandoned sword.}
