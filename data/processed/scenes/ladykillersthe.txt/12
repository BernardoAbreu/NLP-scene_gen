<A>__{they enter a small bedroom. there is a small bed on a brass frame, a chair, a wash basin, and cheerful yellow chintz drapes on the window. dorr appreciatively takes it in.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...thoo out central and southern mississippi. we perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed, in the belief that... that... why, this is lovely...}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{wait a minute. you got some kind of band?}
<A>__{dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the word "band" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism. though we do play together hence the word "ensemble" the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear popping amplification.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{so you don't play hippity hop, "i left my wallet in el segundo," songs with the titles spelt all funny?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{madam, i shudder. i quake. the revulsion i feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, i have no doubt, the equal of y'own. why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of god. devotional music. church music.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{gospel music?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well inspired by the gospels, certainly. the vintage, of course, is no more recent than the rococo.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{rococo, huh? well, i guess that'd be okay.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{but i certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you. may i enquire do you have a root cellar?}
