<A>__{martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. she carries a small bag. her pace becomes increasingly faster. she looks back to see a teenage girl, sarah, standing in the window watching. martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. as she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run. slow zoom: martha disappears into the thick woods. off screen, the house door slams shut. a man urgently yells out: "marcy may" the camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind. for a moment everything is quiet. suddenly, a man and two women enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after martha.}
