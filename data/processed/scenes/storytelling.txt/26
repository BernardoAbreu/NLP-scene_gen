<A>__{toby sits in the living room surrounded by the livingston family. marty fingers a card that reads: toby oxman, documentarian. his address and phone number are printed below.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{...kind of an american family for the new millennium...}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{i thought this was about kids getting into college.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, it is. i mean}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{which is it? you gotta keep your focus straight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're absolutely right. the focus is on the college admissions process today.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{and you want scooby to be the focus of all this?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, well, i don't have them yet, but}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{either scooby is the focus, or forget it.}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{yeah, i thought i was the focus.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{i wanna be the focus.}
<A>__{brady slaps him.}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{toby, we need this to be a positive experience.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, i suppose i could reconceive...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{reconceive.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{'cause scooby does have a quality that i've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of american today. it's part disillusionment, part hope...}
<A>__{consuelo comes in with tea and twinkies.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{twinkeys!}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{boys, take napkins...napkins...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?}
<C>__{fern}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{don't worry, he doesn't mean money.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, i know, i know that. well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can i hope, be an illuminating experience.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah...how do we know we won't be exploited?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{no, it's true.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mr livingston, i fully understand and i share your concerns. you fell vulnerable. and i know that this is a very difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of faith in me, in the same way that i have to make a leap of faith in you?}
<A>__{on video: interior locker room day big esposito, in football attire, surrounded by brady and other athletes, talks to toby. kids whip towels at each other in the background.}
<C>__{esposito}
<D>__{this is a great school. i don't care what anybody says. i mean, it's not perfect, but like the people are really cool, like the teachers and kids...they really care and all. and i know that they make fun of new jersey all the time, but i don't care. 'cause they're just snobs. 'cause jersey is where america's at!}
<A>__{on video: interior empty school hallway day}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{walking down these hallways just like the ones i once walked down as a teenager, i couldn't help thinking back to a time when every day i woke up depressed, suicidal, consumed by despair. had things changed? was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage? beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness i knew that there were darker forces at work...and i knew that scooby was the key to revealing the truth...}
<B>__{various shots of scooby}
<A>__{...looking pensive.}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{scooby, scooby, scooby...what are you thinking? college, sats, your parents, your brothers, your friends...how is it you deal with all this stress?}
<A>__{on video: interior classroom day a school psychologist sits at her desk.}
<C>__{elizabeth st. clair}
<D>__{the pressure to get into the college of your choice is incredible. you know, they did a study recently of the youth in bosnia during the bombing, and they found that the stress the young people experienced there was less than what american high school students go through when applying to college.}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{elizabeth st. clair}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{oh, my god...}
