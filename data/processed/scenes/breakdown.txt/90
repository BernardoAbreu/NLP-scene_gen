<L>__{interior car trunk day}
<A>__{there is a creak as the trunk opens. jeff lies inside, dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. his eyes won't focus. earl and billy stand over the trunk in silhouette. he can hear their voices:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{he coming around?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{should be... i clocked him pretty good...}
<A>__{a gun barrel jabs jeff in the ribs.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{rise and shine, dad.}
<A>__{jeff blinks. a face slowly comes into focus. is it really billy? the halfwit from the diner? only he isn't a halfwit anymore.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{c'mon, shake a leg.}
<A>__{jeff looks at billy. nothing makes sense anymore. but one thing is clear: billy's mental retardation was all an act.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{give us some answers and you might find out. according to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. is that true?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{there's some... yeah...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{uh huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. your wife gave us a dollar figure. i want the same exact from you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(coming around; stalling)}
<D>__{i don't there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{fluctuates, my ass. if a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{what do you think, earl?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we been fucked with, is what i think. little slut lied to us. put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive.}
<A>__{billy nods, disappointed.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose. too bad.}
<P>__{(peers down at jeff)}
<D>__{guess you're not the donut magnate after all.}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{waste of time. plug him.}
<A>__{earl raises a pistol. jeff's eyes flash.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{ninety thousand.}
<A>__{earl stops, glances at billy. they both eye jeff carefully.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{say again.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{ninety thousand dollars.}
<A>__{a faint smile plays on billy's lips. he slams the trunk.}
