<A>__{the courtroom as without warning, it quiets. there is suddenly a tremendous air of expectancy, you can feel it. now we see why as five men in dark business suits are led in; they've been stripped of belts, ties, and shoelaces. mccord is taller than the others. they stand, facing the judge, backs to the audience. woodward sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's hard to hear. he concentrates as the judge starts speaking.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{will you please state your professions.}
<A>__{the five men do not move or reply. then, after a long pause, barker says }
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{anti communists.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{anti communists?}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{that, sir, is not your average occupation.}
<A>__{woodward starts moving forward now, down an aisle, moving past kids and whores and all the rest, trying to hear what the hell's going on. at the front of the spectator's section is a fence like wooden barricade about three feet high. as he approaches it the judge indicates the bald burglar.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{your name, please.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{james mccord.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{will you step forward, sir.}
<P>__{(mccord obeys)}
<A>__{woodward at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and what is your occupation, mr. mccord?}
<C>__{mccord}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{security consultant.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{mccord}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{government. recently retired.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{where in government?}
<C>__{mccord}
<P>__{(we can't really make this out)}
<D>__{...central... intelligence... agency...}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(he can't either)}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{mccord}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{the c.i.a.}
<A>__{and on these words,}
