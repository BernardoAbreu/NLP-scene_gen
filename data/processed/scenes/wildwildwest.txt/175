<L>__{interior loveless's lair amphitheater dusk}
<A>__{immediately two flame throwers explode from his cone like bosoms. maybe he should've listened about the dress. he turns to gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of loveless's goons. he howls in pain, runs panicked... right into rita.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{serves you right for staring at them.}
<A>__{as she relieves the charred goon of his keys... loveless turns to the rest of his goons.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{kill him!}
<P>__{(off their confused looks, points)}
<D>__{him! him! the girl!}
<A>__{finally getting it, they rush ebonia. even his 4th of july breasts aren't a match for them. desperate, west reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of gordon's billiard balls. he depresses the number and rolls it at the guards.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{was that the eight ball?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<A>__{gordon grabs west and rita, pulls them behind the bar.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{that one's an incendiary bomb.}
<A>__{ka boooom! an explosion rips the place and a santa ana sized fire starts immediately. rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a bearded scientist.}
<D>__{west gordon rita!}
<A>__{she unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(disappearing into the chaos)}
<D>__{meet me after the show!}
<A>__{both west and gordon look after her with yearning as three goons charge them. coleman, amazed at their torpor, quickly grabs a rifle from the incinerated goon and opens fire. blam! blam! blam! three goons drop. gordon and west exchange looks. not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{special marshal... president thought you needed some lookin' after.}
<A>__{speaking of the president... he's grabbed a dead goon's rifle, and is laying down a pretty good field of fire himself. suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind. it's amazonia. whap, she sends a right to his chin knocking him out. she throws him over her shoulder and carries him away.}
