<A>__{anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run. he gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to drink. he waits in line. he doesn't like to be in a line, waiting. the woman ahead of him argues about change. he presses his lips together. and then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera dome attached to the ceiling. it gives him a fish eye reflected view of what's happening behind him. precrime police are happening behind him. he doesn't stop to ponder, as two python transports zoom up outside the store. anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the clerk to the floor.}
