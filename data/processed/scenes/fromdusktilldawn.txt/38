<L>__{exterior courtyard night}
<A>__{seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. he's thinking about how he's going to get over the border tonight. lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the fuller's motor home. jacob slams on the brakes. seth jumps back, startled. both kate and scott are tossed out of their seats onto the floor.}
<B>__{thud... thud...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{owww, my head.}
<A>__{jacob (pissed) honks his horn at seth and yells out the window.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{watch where you're going!}
<B>__{through windshield}
<A>__{seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing up at the giant motor home.}
<B>__{jacob behind the wheel}
<A>__{kate and scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what's this guy's problem?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<A>__{seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to move. not threatening, just looking at them. honk!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{anytime, man.}
<A>__{the horn snaps seth back to this world. a smile breaks out on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one side to let them pass. pass they do!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{creepy guy.}
<B>__{seth}
<A>__{the sword of damocles is lifted from above seth's head. he's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. he knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.}
