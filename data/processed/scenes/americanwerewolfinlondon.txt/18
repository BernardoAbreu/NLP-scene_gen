<L>__{exterior roadside on the moors night}
<A>__{david and jack are now completely out of sight from east proctor surrounded by darkness and wet. there is a light drizzle. they are standing, listening. the drizzle stops.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did you hear that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i heard that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{david begins to walk, jack with him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{could be a lot of things.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a coyote.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there aren't any coyotes in england.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the hound of the baskervilles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pecos bill.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{heathcliffe.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{heathcliffe didn't howl.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, but he was on the moors.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's a full moon, `beware the moon'.}
<A>__{another howl, this one long and loud. it is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{they are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came. although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere. they stop out of breath.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we're lost.}
<A>__{another bloodcurdling howl.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shit! david, what is that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know. come on.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, where?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{anywhere! i think we should just keep moving.}
<A>__{a growl. a low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness. we stay on the boys, but we hear something out there. it starts to walk.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's moving.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's circling us.}
<A>__{and indeed it is. the boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it. a snarl.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{we hear the wolf monster stop (for that's what it is we know it's there even though we've not seen it). it sits breathing heavily.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what's the plan?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{plan?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(not too relaxed himself)}
<D>__{let's just keep walking.}
<A>__{they do and david keeps talking as they walk.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's right, a lovely stroll in the moors. tra la la, isn't this fun?}
<A>__{the thing stalking them seems to speed up. the boys hesitate as they sense it run past them. it stops.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's in front of us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{do you think it's a dog?}
<A>__{jack and david strain to see what waits ahead of them. boys' p.o.v. something is waiting in the darkness. its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh shit. what is that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a sheep dog or something. turn slowly and let's walk away.}
<A>__{the boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice doggie. good boy.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{walk away, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{walking away, yes, sir. here we are walking away.}
<A>__{they are in a full out run by now. after a few minutes flight they stop, panting.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{see anything?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a moment of quiet, then a howl.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it sounds far away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not far enough. come on.}
<A>__{they walk briskly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will tell you when we get there.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well. i'm glad we...whoaa!!}
<A>__{david shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring jack, and us, and himself a great deal. he lays startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and jack laugh.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you really scared me, you shithead.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you going to help me up?}
<A>__{jack takes david's extended hand to help him up when the wolf monster springs!}
