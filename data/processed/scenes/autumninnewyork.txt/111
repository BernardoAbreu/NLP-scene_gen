<A>__{charlotte lies in the bed with her eyes closed. an ekg monitor bleeps steadily in the corner. an iv drip hangs by her bed. wills enters and sits down at her bedside. he touches her hand. she opens her eyes and smiles drowsily }

<D>__{you still owe me a birthday present.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i do not.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{just 'cause i fainted is no excuse for you to bail on your peacock pose.}
<A>__{she smiles sleepily. wills lifts a hand to her mouth and whispers:}

<D>__{it ought to be illegal.}
<C>__{charlotte}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you wanna hear a story... a bedtime story?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{shouldn't i be telling you one?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{once upon a time, there was a woman on a ship crossing the atlantic and her little boy got sick. very sick. and she said whoever saves my boy's life... i will name my next baby after them. well, they got into port and they rushed her son to st. vincent's hospital... to here... and they saved his life. and so the mother named her next baby edna st. vincent millay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and edna grew up to be, as i am sure you know, the second greatest female poet in american history.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the first would be emily dickinson.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you're a quick learner i like that about you...}
<P>__{(half to herself)}
<D>__{"it may be, when my heart is dull, having attained its girth, i shall not find so beautiful the meagre shapes of earth, nor linger in the rain to mark the small of tansy through the dark."}
<A>__{her eyes drift shut }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i am so pretentious...}
<A>__{wills laughs, then clears his throat, and looks suddenly serious }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{charlotte, listen, i }
<C>__{charlotte}

<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i just think }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no. no violins. i'm fine. go home... sleep...}
<A>__{he considers for a moment, then, tears welling in his eyes, he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it.}
