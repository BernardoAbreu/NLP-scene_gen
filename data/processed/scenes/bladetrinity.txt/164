<A>__{abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her bows. nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment a bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets. across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. there's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed. close on abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion, re setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the center shot position and wheel timing, etc.}

<D>__{it already has. since i can remember i've had this knife of sadness in my heart. as long as it stays there, i'm strong. i'm untouchable. but the moment i pull it out }

<B>__{on abigail}
<A>__{she stands, moving to the shooting range. she straps on a quiver, takes aim at a 3 d human shaped target about a hundred feet away. just in front of the target is the chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts. whoosh! abigail fires an arrow. it flies through the arms of the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest. on the screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked at 240 feet per second. we move closer to her now as whoosh! abicail fires again. the speed is 242 fps. closer whoosh! now the speed is 269 fps. even closer whoosh!whoosh!whoosh! 285 fps. 302 fps. 315 fps! the arrow speed creeps up and up as we move closer and closer to abigail until we pull back. abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver.}
<B>__{on the target}
<A>__{the arrows have formed a cross in the target's chest. one vertical grouping running up, another horizontal grouping bisecting it.}
