<L>__{interior penelope's kitchen day}
<A>__{bloom and penelope sit in a luxurious stone based kitchen, neither touching their coffee. bloom talks. this is how penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts, then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile nod, then does it all again. three or four times.}

<D>__{...didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in charleston. so we stuck together, my brother stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died. then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to paris and steamer ships and calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life. so we did, and we've been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, i'm sorry, stop doing that, you're, i'm, ok. alright, look.}
