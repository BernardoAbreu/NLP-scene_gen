<L>__{interior cia headquarters terrorism situation room day}
<A>__{this is a high tech, ultra modern chrome and glass room which features a map of the world etched in plexiglass with terrorist hot spots marked prominently. on the glass as well is the logo of the cia. in this situation room we find winston scott iii, a 50 year old pin striped suiter who appears to be amused. with him is monroe, his black deputy and jack. in front of jack, spread out on the desk is a file on ramirez. we see it as jack does. notes on the interrogation, polaroid photos of ramirez in custory and the developed pictures from the roll of film which ramirez was taking in jerusalem. jack listens to scott and monroe, but as he does he is taking in all the information in ramirez's file, making no judgments, just taking in information.}
