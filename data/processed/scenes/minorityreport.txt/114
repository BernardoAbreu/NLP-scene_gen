<A>__{a different part of the city. anderson hunkers low in the back seat of a tram. he looks up, as the driver swears}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what the hell }
<A>__{anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the windshield. precrime transports are heading straight at the tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue. they've even taken radio control of the p.a. system on the tram.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{paul anderson. drop to your hands and knees!}
<A>__{anderson can't believe it how are they suddenly pinpointing him? the passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare at him, terrified. anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street. he rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into his bag for a glove. he pulls the weapon onto his right hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament. precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the street. he looks up. he is surrounded by skyscrapers and buildings he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban canyon. people freeze against the sides of buildings, run into doorways where they can. passengers in trans and taxis or cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching. nothing moves, except the python transports, closing in. the lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically altered voice.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{lower your weapon, or we will neutralize your threat potential.}
<A>__{the precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men. anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building closest to him. anderson's pov a high pressure hydrant the large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building. anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{do not move!}
<A>__{anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the building, right beside the high pressure hydrant. he stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing. it is a moment for prayer. anderson doesn't have a moment. he spreads his feet and fires a massive sonic blast down at the sidewalk. the effect on the underground water main is immediate. a geyser of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling anderson fifteen feet into the air right alongside the building. the stunned police officers try to take aim, but anderson's bouncing at the top of the geyser. and they can't fire, anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement from every window in the building. all this in a time span of seconds. the world spins crazily for anderson, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support beam holding the building's sign, one story up. the police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of water from the water main break obscures his moves. he pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along it toward a second story window. the office building gawkers lurch backward from the window as anderson blasts it to sparkling dust and leaps inside.}
