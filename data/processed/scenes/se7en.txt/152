<L>__{interior precinct house, observation room day}
<A>__{mills, somerset and the captain stand in darkness. on the other side of a two way mirror, john doe is seated in a restraining chair in an interrogation room. his hands and legs are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs. a strap hold tight around doe's throat. this is not some superman serial killer. he looks more like an eccentric college professor. his lawyer mark swarr, 43, sits at a table, taking notes. mills holds a fingerprint card. the black ink prints are just useless blobs with traces of blood in them.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{he cuts off the skin of his fingertips. that's why we can't find a single usable print in his apartment. for a long time, he's been cutting before the papillary lines can grow back.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what about the trace on his bank account? the guns?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{the orphanage is all we have. his bank account is only five years old and it started as cash. there's no credit history, no employment history. we even tried to trace his furniture. all we know for sure is he's wealthy, well educated and totally insane. we may never know how he got that way.}
<A>__{somerset stands looking in at doe.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{because he is john doe, by choice.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{when do we get to question him?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{you don't. this goes to court now.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{this doesn't make sense, captain. he wouldn't just turn himself in!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{well, there he sits. it's not supposed to make sense.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{he's not finished!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{you're wound way too tight on this, mills.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{somerset... help me out here.}
<A>__{somerset looks at them. says nothing.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{it's over.}
<A>__{the captain leaves. mills is furious.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{damn it, somerset. you know johnny's fucking with us. he's pissing in our faces again!}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{slow up. you and i are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. he wouldn't just stop.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{well... what the fuck, man?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{john doe's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? but, can you even conceive of what might happen next? i mean, can you tell me how he's going to go about it?}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i can tell you this; i recognize his lawyer. his name is mark swarr. he's the one who kept zero out of prison.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we'll wait for john doe's plea.}
