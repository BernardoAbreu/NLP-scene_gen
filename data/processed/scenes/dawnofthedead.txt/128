<A>__{in the chart house, peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee machine at one end of the room. the machine clicks loudly and spits out a cup. to peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill with hot brown liquid. while he waits. peter notices a series of notes taped to the machine and the surrounding walls. they are all written hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and colours.}
<D>__{lucy gone to johnstown. charles i have the kids. left with ben. couldn't wait. gone to erie jack foster.}
<A>__{there are dozens of such messages. peter takes the full coffee cup from the machine. as he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet door just across the room. it is moving slightly. it is locked, but it bangs against the lock... once... twice... more regularly than if caused by the wind drafts. peter steps closer. now the door bangs violently with a loud crash, but it holds. peter sets his coffee on the chart table and takes his rifle in both hands. again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of the keyhole. it falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum. another bang and a gurgling moan. one of the living dead is trying to break out of the closet. quite calmly. peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door about head high. the rifle roars in the little room, and a splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.}
