<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{the headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on the slant roof of a barn: jesus saves.}
<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{joe is alone again. the salesman has disappeared. the bus is dark, most passengers trying to sleep. only one reading light still burns, over the head of the old lady in the seat ahead of joe. joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the radio.}
<C>__{sally buck's voice}
<D>__{don't forget to say your prayers, honey...}
<A>__{joe leans forward to help the old lady, irritably struggling with the release button on her seat. she scowls as joe leans over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her and turns away from him. joe switches off her reading light.}
<C>__{old lady}
<D>__{i want it on.}
<A>__{joe switches it on again, fakes a good natured grin, settles back with his radio, aware of an old cowhand seated opposite him, replacing the pale blonde. the old cowhand is appraising joe's wardrobe curiously. he looks away when he sees joe watching him. joe settles back, unable to think of a way to open a conversation.}
<C>__{evangelist's voice}
<D>__{oh, my friends, i say unto you, invest with jesus, put your dollars to work where they'll pay off at compound interest. the good book says money answereth all things...}
<A>__{the old cowhand has rolled himself a cigarette. joe quickly lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{light?}
<A>__{the old cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he inhales his first drag. he settles back, wiping his watery eyes on a faded bandana.}
<C>__{evangelist's voice}
<D>__{... everyone who sends a dollar to the evangelical congregation of the air will get free gratis a genuine leatherette hymn book so you can sing along with sister rosella and the evangelical choir...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you throw in sister rosella and you got a deal, right, old timer?}
<A>__{joe glances across the aisle. the old cowhand manages a faint, humorless smile.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{going far?}
<C>__{old cowhand}
<D>__{up the line. not far.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm bound for new york city.}
<A>__{the old cowhand reappraises joe's wardrobe even more curiously.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ever happen to come across a cowman name of woodsy niles? friend of my grammaw sally buck...}
<A>__{the old cowhand considers, shakes his head. joe leans back, laughing to himself.}
