<L>__{interior early mega tunnel day}
<A>__{a gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "chunnel". a banner strung overhead reads: "the mega tunnel tunneling our way to a bright future!" along the walls hang 50's work incentive style posters with messages like, "you asked for it, you got it more work!" and "two meals a week is enough!!!" line after line of ants is working on the tunnel, digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone synchronized. close on a clump of dirt being passed from hand to hand.}
<B>__{pull out to reveal}
<A>__{azteca, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on. z is daydreaming behind her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{hello?! earth to z! you better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!}
<A>__{z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{sorry azteca. here you go, fellas! fresh dirt! alley oop!}
<P>__{(looking at the dirt)}
<D>__{shouldn't we be wearing gloves? i mean this dirt is very...dirty. doesn't anyone think of hygiene?}
<P>__{(z's stomach growls)}
<D>__{boy am i hungry. i'm so hungry i'm seeing double. it looks like there'stwo million ants in here. when's lunch? tomorrow, or the day after?}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{z, old pal...}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{shut up!!! it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{the squeaky wheel gets the oil.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{no, z. the squeaky wheel gets thrownaway, alright? you're a good ant, z, even though you are a pain in my rear segment. i don't wanna see anything happen to you. so quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.}
<B>__{a whistle blows.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{thank goodness. breaktime.}
<A>__{all the ants put down their tools. a beat. then the whistle blows again. all the ants pick up their tools again.}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{break's over.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(getting back to work)}
<D>__{this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. why are we even digging this thing?}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{who cares, z. all i know is, we gotta dig. we're not the ones in charge.}
