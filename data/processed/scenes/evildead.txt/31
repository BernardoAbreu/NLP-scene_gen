<L>__{30 interior night c}
<A>__{down below, ashly moves quietly past the old stone walls and wooden beams which support the main floor above. in front of him stands an old door which leads to another section of the cellar. cautiously, he moves toward it. before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with a moan. ashly moves through the doorway and deeper into the cellar. condensation from water pipes above turn the cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow pools on the dirt floor below. as ashly scans with his light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{scott?}
<A>__{ashly breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from the area where the shadow passed. he backs sqarely into a pair of arms which grab him.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{it is only scott behind him.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing down here, jerkin' off? how come you didn't answer me?}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh well, did you find anything?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{scott sweeps his light to another corner and reveals several items atop a small table. beneath a dusty cloth, he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the cover. along with this book, scott and ashly uncover a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.}
