<A>__{the camera glides off some fishermen hauling their catch off their beached boat to darien who comes tromping out of the surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. bud stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel. she steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. takes the towel from him, drying herself, instead.}
