<D>__{winds in the east mist coming in }
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{a whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst white fluffy clouds. a shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella) dances amongst the nimbus.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ like something is brewing, about to begin }
<A>__{the shadow's direction becomes purposeful taking us down through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ can't put me finger on what lies in store }
<A>__{downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens. there, a ten year old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns and gives a satisfied nod. she wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half smile threatening to break across her concentrated face. this is the young p.l. travers (whom we will also know as ginty.)}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ but i feel what's to happen, all happened before }
<A>__{her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real.}
