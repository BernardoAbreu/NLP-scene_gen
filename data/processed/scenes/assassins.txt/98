<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{her eyes are now burning red. she stops crying long enough to suck down an entire sample of scotch. nikita rubs against her and she strokes her.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh shit, nikita.}
<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{rath is setting up his computer system. he hears the tub}
<B>__{filling up.}
<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor where we see that many of the bottles are now empty. in the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the water.}
<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{when electra comes out of the bathroom, rath is again at his chess game. she sits down across from him and sets the gun on the table between them. rath looks up at her.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{listen i don't even know your name.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{rath. robert rath.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{electra.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{just electra?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{as in daughter of agamemnon?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{no. just electra.}
<A>__{the conversation dies.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what i'm trying to say is that i'm not sure i can do this, help you, unless i know more about you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what do you want to know?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{if bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?}
<A>__{he stares at her.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because i'm done.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{this is crazy. i can't trust you. you can't trust me. how can we possibly help each other?}
<A>__{they sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying between them.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you play?}
<A>__{she looks at the chess board.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{with computers.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's not the same, is it?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{better than playing with yourself.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i had an opponent.}
<A>__{she understands that he is trying to tell her something.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{had?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he was russian. nicholai tachlinkov. a legend in the business when i was just starting. i admired him. when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game.}
<A>__{electra studies the board.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he was white?}
<A>__{rath nods.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{it looks like white's game.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we played with a code using}
<A>__{the new york times obituaries. over three}
<D>__{years we played twelve matches. i never won.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why didn't you finish this game?}
<A>__{she reaches over and lifts a white knight and takes a bishop. rath counters, taking her knight.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he was... taken.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he was killed.}
<A>__{rath nods. throughout the entire conversation they continue to play out the chess game.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{by who?}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i killed him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because that's how it works. that's what it's about. he was the best. he was on top.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{where you wanted to be?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. as soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top. that's all there is. until then, there is nothing. you are nothing.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{how did you get into the business?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the same way everyone does; the government, the agency.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{the c.i.a.?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{more or less.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{how old were you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{they recruited me when i was in high school.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{jesus why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{languages. i was already fluent in nine languages.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you were like a boy genius?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{some people said that. i never thought so.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i was just different.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you went from high school to the agency?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. i graduated from george washington university. then i entered the agency training program.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{they didn't give you a choice, did they?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no, they didn't.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{but you knew what they were training you for?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{of course. i was going to be james bond.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{ahhhh...}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{they are very good at what they do. it's very seductive. the training, the weapons, the travel }
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{the exotic women.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{women? no... not really.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{women... i don't... i don't want to talk about women.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because you are a women.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why did you leave the agency?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the same reason everyone does. you hear your name on c span and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{they tried to kill you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{then you went freelance?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{tell me about the first time.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{my first take?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{because i want to know.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it was... mechanical. very precise. it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{are they usually like that?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. just the first one.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{after that?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{they become complicated... messy.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{did it ever bother you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{did it ever bother james bond?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that's fiction.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{this is fiction! don't you see that? this is another reality. and the people that come into the world to play this game nobody forces them! they're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks! do you understand what i am saying? no one is innocent including you!}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{does that mean it didn't bother you?}
<A>__{rath leans back and stares at her. she waits.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time. you keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again.}
<A>__{electra says nothing. he leans forward and slides a rook into her back row.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{check.}
<A>__{he leans back.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded... something remorseless...}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{no. something honest.}
<A>__{a beat. rath likes this woman. she moves her queen.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{mate.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i hope your plan is better than your game.}
