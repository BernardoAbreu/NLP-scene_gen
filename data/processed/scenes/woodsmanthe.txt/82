<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{i'm not a monster.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{you're a good man, walter. okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{maybe i'm not a good man. maybe inside i'm bad, and i will always be bad.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{don't talk like that.}
<A>__{the waitress interrupts to clear the table, leaning over to grab the empty plates. carlos checks her out.}
<C>__{carlos }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{next week annette is going away for a few days. and the thing is that when annette's away...}
<A>__{carlos watches the waitress depart.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{i get horny as hell for other women.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me this.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i'm just talking, man.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{carlos, i never raped a woman.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i know. i'm just saying i understand.}
<A>__{walter doesn't look at carlos.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{it's crazy out there.}
<P>__{(signaling to the crowd)}
<D>__{young girls wearing mini this and mini that. sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like i'm bothering her. she stares down like she's afraid to look at me. why she do that? why can't she look me in the face?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{maybe because you're looking her in the face.}
<A>__{carlos looks at walter.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i see a pretty woman, i look. that's the price of beauty, my friend. my god, you should see what anna's friends wear.}
<A>__{carlos laughs. walter looks at him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{carlos, can i ask you something?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{ask me. ask me anything.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you ever... do you have feelings for anna?}
<A>__{carlos looks at walter.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i mean... feelings.}
<A>__{a look of horror disgust passes over carlos's face, and he lurches forward grabbing walter by the shirt collar. drinks spill.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{listen, man. i don't got your sick problem, and if you or anybody else ever comes near my daughter, i will kill you.}
<A>__{carlos lets go of walter roughly and gets up and leaves. walter looks around embarrassed onlookers slowly turn away. walter picks up a napkin and starts to blot the table dry.}
