<L>__{interior elijah muhammad's house, chicago, 1964 joseph 13x day}
<A>__{approaches cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a living room in which sits elijah muhammad on a plastic covered white sofa. cassius is at his most deferential, awed at being in this man's presence. elijah's power is the inverse of his size. he's short and delicate featured. he motions for cassius to sit beside him. joseph 13x sits across the room with two men.}
<C>__{elijah muhammad}
<D>__{only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of afro american people...is one granted an original name. but you are special. a world champion. so there is a gift i wish to give you. from this day forward you will be known as muhammad ali...which means "one worthy of praise," and ali means "most high."}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(a beat, sounding it)}
<D>__{muhammad ali.}
<P>__{(humble)}
<D>__{"worthy of praise..." thank you!}
<A>__{and he's genuinely moved. as elijah muhammad puts his small hands in muhammad ali's hands...giving him his blessings...}
<C>__{elijah muhammad}
<P>__{(cautioning)}
<D>__{be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of islam, now.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{elijah muhammad}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{up until now, i have entrusted your spiritual development to brother malcolm.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i do not feel this is a wise course anymore.}
<A>__{extremely emotional about malcolm, tears come to elijah muhammad's eyes. joseph 13x observes in the background. cassius is taken by surprise at "the messenger"'s display...}
<C>__{elijah muhammad }
<D>__{malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. i have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, herbert muhammad.}
<A>__{and he looks across the room...a roly poly man wearing a bow tie...herbert muhammad. he has a habit of nervously straightening his shirt. a seemingly mild, pleasant man, he is without self definition. below this avuncular surface, he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is others'.}
<C>__{elijah muhammad }
<D>__{herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs.}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(not a thought)}
<D>__{this is a great honor, messenger...}
<A>__{elijah gives a subtle look and herbert retreats to where he came from, sitting back on the couch by joseph 13x...}
