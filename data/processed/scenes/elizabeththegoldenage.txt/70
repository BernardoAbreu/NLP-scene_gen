<L>__{interior dee's house dusk}
<A>__{the finest library in england. the greatest array of scientific instruments. part study, part laboratory, part magician's lair, dr dee's house is crammed with the evidence of his wide ranging curiosity. the magus sits at a table before an astrological chart, while elizabeth and walsingham look on.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{the alignment of the planets is most unusual this year. mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of your birth your majesty was born on september 7th and i see that twelve days before the anniversary of your birth }
<A>__{he transfers his attention to a different, astronomical chart.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{ there will be a full moon the moon which }
<A>__{he moves back to the astrological chart.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{ governs the fortunes of all princes of the female gender.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{princes of the female gender.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{i mean to say, a prince who is also a woman.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes, dr dee. i am following you. so what does it all mean?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{it means the rise of a great empire, majesty. and it means convulsions, also. the fall of an empire.}
<A>__{elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. she knows nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within herself: her moment of destiny is near.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{which empire is to rise, and which is to fall?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{that i can't say. astrology is, as yet, more an art than a science.}
<A>__{walsingham has been idly examining the scientific instruments. he speaks now as if his question is casual.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{nothing more, dr dee? no more specific calamities that we can guard against?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he means, will i be assassinated?}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{queens are mortal.}
<A>__{dr dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{elizabeth is mortal. the queen will never die.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you see, francis? this is a mystery.}
<P>__{(to dee)}
<D>__{he has no patience with mysteries. w}
<C>__{alsingham}
<D>__{what i don't know, i can't use.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{and yet mysteries have power. have you not learned that?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{francis. leave us for a moment.}
<A>__{walsingham leaves. elizabeth turns to dr dee. now for a short private moment the queen becomes a woman.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and the private life of this prince of the female gender, dr dee? what do the stars foretell there? or is this too a mystery?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{these are matters of state, majesty.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{do the stars not foretell matters of state?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{for such a prediction, i must look in a different chart.}
<A>__{he means her face. he murmurs to himself as he studies her features, reading her character.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{wonderful... out of such suffering, to have forged such strength... you will need all your strength in days to come... and love... so much love...}
<A>__{but as he looks, he finds something more that disturbs him.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{but you doubt yourself, my child... i've not seen fear in your face before.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{have i reason to fear?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{something has weakened you... there is danger, yes... your strength lies in your spirit. nothing else matters. there are hard days coming. you must trust the power of your spirit.}
<A>__{elizabeth is shaken by these words. dee turns to look out once more at the night sky.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{but i'm no prophet. i see no more than the shadows of ghosts.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{an art, not a science. i understand.}
