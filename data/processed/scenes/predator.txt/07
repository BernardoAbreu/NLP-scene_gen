<L>__{interior palapa day}
<A>__{large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof. behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of compact field radio equipment, maps and aerial photographs. otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in stark contrast to this high tech invasion. philips and schaefer enter the room.}
<C>__{philips}
<P>__{(growing serious)}
<D>__{we've got a real problem here, something right up your alley.}
<A>__{they cross to the center of the room to a folding table, covered with a large topographical map of the central american highland jungle. philips leans over the table, circling a set of coordinates and a mark on the open map.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{eighteen hours ago i was informed that one of our choppers, transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming little country, was shot down...}
<P>__{(point to}
<D>__{the circled}
<P>__{area)}
<D>__{...the pilots radioed from the ground that they were all alive. their position was fixed by the transponder beacon onboard the chopper.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{schaefer studies the map. he looks up at philips.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{that's over the border, general.}
<C>__{philips}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{that's the problem. apparently they strayed off course.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.}
<A>__{schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what have you got in mind, general.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{we figure we've got less than twenty four hours to catch up with them. after that, there's not much hope. we want a rescue operation mounted tonight. that doesn't give you much time.}
<A>__{another puff on the cigar.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what else it new? when do we leave?}
<A>__{philips looks at his watch.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{you lift off in three hours.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's one other thing.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what's that, general?}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{someone else will be going in with you.}
<A>__{schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you know we don't work with outsiders, general.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{who said anything about outsiders, dutch?}
<A>__{schaefer turns, seeing the outline of a figure standing in the doorway of the communications room, holding a sheaf of papers. wearing pressed fatigues, dillon, mid thirties, black, walks into the room. although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing and grooming indicate he's been away from the business of soldiering for sometime. his quick intelligent eyes reveal his current profession.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{last time we danced, it was lieutenant, schaefer.}
<A>__{a grin breaks out across schaefer's face.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{dillon, you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{the two men step forward and simultaneous swing from the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands slap together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms bulging, testing each other's strength.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{how you been, dutch?}
<A>__{they continue the contest, schaefer has the edge, forcing dillon's arm slowly downward.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you've been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{no way, old buddy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you never did know when to quit.}
<A>__{they look into each other's faces, each remembering something from the past. a moment's hesitation and they quit the contest. they laugh, dillon slapping schaefer on the shoulder.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{like the old days, dillon.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{also heard that you passed on that little job in libya.}
<A>__{schaefer looks at dillon, quietly considering him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{wasn't my style. we're a rescue unit, not assassins.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what's so important?}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department...and here we are.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{dillon goes to the map.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{the set up is simple, dutch. one day job. we pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there. you've done it a hundred times. nothing out of the ordinary.}
<A>__{schaefer considers this.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{and nothing we can't handle alone.}
<A>__{philips breaks in.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{i'm afraid those are your orders, major. once you reach your objective, dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.}
<A>__{schaefer looks from philips to dillon. he still doesn't like it.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{not to worry, dutch. i haven't lost my edge. they've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake.}
<C>__{philips}
<D>__{gentlemen, we're losing time.}
<P>__{(to schaefer)}
<D>__{you'd better get your men ready.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{good luck, major.}
