<L>__{interior randy's house, living room night}
<A>__{mike, jeff and ruth sit on a ratty couch in randy's living room, watching beavis and butt head on mtv. some empty beer cans and a homeade bong litter a coffee table. when the front door opens and corey and randy enter, none of them budge. as corey and randy walk to randy's bedroom, ruth follows them with her eyes...}
<L>__{interior randy's house, bedroom continuous}
<A>__{randy shuts the door to his messy room. a tapestry hangs from the ceiling. corey is drawn to a desk next to the bed. above it is a death shrine to kurt cobain magazine cutouts, posters and ticket stubs arranged decoratively. a large black & white poster showing a close up of cobain's face is the centerpiece, and a sloppy bullet hole drawn in red marker marks the center of his forehead. the words `i'm not afraid of dying' are scrawled across the bottom of the poster in the same bright red.}

<D>__{this is cool.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso. corey turns to face him... they kiss... ...and fall back onto the bed...}
