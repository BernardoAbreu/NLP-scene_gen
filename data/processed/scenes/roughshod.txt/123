<L>__{exterior meadow}
<A>__{close shot down angle. mary is asleep in the shade of a pine. she lies on a tarp using a folded blanket for a pillow. it is very quiet. she stirs, opens her eyes. her expression changes. a soft smile plays around her lips as camera angle widens and we see clay sitting near her, leaning against the bole of a pine. he isn't looking at her. mary watches him for a moment.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{roll me a cigarette, clay.}
<A>__{clay looks over at her. then rising he moves closer, squats and rolls a cigarette. he holds it out. she licks it, then puts it in her mouth. clay lights a match, holds it out. she catches his hand and holds the flame to her cigarette.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she still holds his hand. they look at each other.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why didn't you wake me?}
<A>__{clay doesn't answer.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you should have. i don't like leaving things unfinished.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{maybe it's better that way.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{you don't mean that clay.}
<A>__{she holds his hand, smiling up. clay hesitates, then desire for her is more than he can bear, so he takes her in his arms. they kiss, holding the kiss for a long while.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{they break. she lies looking up. he half lies, half sits beside her.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{tell me, darling.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what does a man usually tell a girl?}
<A>__{for answer, clay kisses her again hard, ruthlessly. his hands crush her shoulders. mary holds the kiss for a moment, then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants to hear. his hands pull her toward him. mary wants the kiss but she also wants a declaration of love. she makes one last try to get it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{tell me please }
<A>__{clay's grip on her shoulders tightens. she searches his face with a glance stares into his eyes then pushes him away and sits up.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{mary. she is hurt by his silence.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{all right you don't love me. so let it go at that.}
<A>__{camera angle widens. clay's expression hardens. he drops his hands from her shoulders.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what did you expect? speeches i don't mean?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i don't expect anything. a minute ago i hadn't cuite waked up.}
<A>__{she stands. he rises to face her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm awake now. go on. say what you want to say. i will listen.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{if it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. even when i mean 'em, they don't come easy.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{save 'em for the girl in gingham. just tell me i'm not good enough for you. go on. say a woman like me can't change.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right it's said!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{then let's get started. the sooner i get to sonora, the better i will like it.}
<A>__{turning she starts down toward camp.}
<B>__{med. long shot}
<A>__{angled past clay. below is the camp. beyond the camp, through the trees, stands the wagon and steve is hitching up the mules. clay hesitates, then follows.}
<B>__{close trucking shot}
