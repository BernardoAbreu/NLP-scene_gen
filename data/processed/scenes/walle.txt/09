<L>__{exterior truck night}
<A>__{wall e motors outside. turns over his igloo cooler to clean it out. pauses to take in the night sky. stars struggle to be seen through the polluted haze. wall e presses the "play" button on his chest. the newly sampled it only takes a moment (iotam) plays. the wind picks up. a warning light sounds on wall e's chest. he looks out into the night. a raging sandstorm approaches off the bay... unfazed, wall e heads back in the truck. iotam still gently playing. ...the massive wave of sand roars closer... wall e raises the door. pauses. whistles for his cockroach to come inside. the door shuts just as the storm hits. obliterates everything in view.}
