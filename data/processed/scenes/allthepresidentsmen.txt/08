<D>__{mr. rafferty was very helpful. four cuban americans and this other man, james mccord.}

<D>__{look, i told you inside }
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ you have nothing more to say, i understand that.}
<A>__{caddy turns away; woodward goes right on.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{what i don't understand is how you got here.}
<C>__{caddy}
<D>__{i assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{probably you're right, but a little while ago, i was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.}
<C>__{caddy}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. and that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel they never even made a phone call.}
<P>__{(looks at caddy)}
<D>__{so if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?}
<A>__{without a word, caddy turns, leaves the line without getting a drink. silently, woodward watches. now }
