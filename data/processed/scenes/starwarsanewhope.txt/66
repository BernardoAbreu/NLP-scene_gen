<L>__{interior docking bay 94 day}
<A>__{jabba the hut and a half dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. he is a fat, slug like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.}
<C>__{jabba}
<D>__{come on out, solo!}
<A>__{a voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see han solo and the giant wookiee, chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you, jabba.}
<C>__{jabba}
<D>__{i expected you would be.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i'm not the type to run.}
<C>__{jabba}
<P>__{(fatherly smooth)}
<D>__{han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that... after all we've been through together.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{you sent greedo to blast me.}
<C>__{jabba}
<P>__{(mock surprise)}
<D>__{han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. you're too valuable to fry. he was only relaying my concern at your delays. he wasn't going to blast you.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i think he thought he was. next time don't send one of those twerps. if you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.}
<C>__{jabba}
<D>__{han, han! if only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand i just can't make an exception. where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship? it's not good business.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{you know, even i get boarded sometimes, jabba. i had no choice, but i've got a charter now and i can pay you back, plus a little extra. i just need some more time.}
<C>__{jabba}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{put your blasters away. han, my boy, i'm only doing this because you're the best and i need you. so, for an extra, say twenty percent i will give you a little more time... but this is it. if you disappoint me again, i will put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{jabba, i will pay you because it's my pleasure.}
