<L>__{exterior establishing the tower}
<A>__{the stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to this day as the wallace tower.}
<L>__{interior prison night}
<A>__{wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints. we can only see his eyes, as he prays.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i am so afraid... give me strength.}
<B>__{outside the cell door}
<A>__{the jailers jump to their feet as the princess enters.}
<C>__{jailer}
<D>__{your highness!}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i will see the prisoner.}
<C>__{jailer}
<D>__{we've orders from the king }
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{the king will be dead in a month! and his son is a weakling! who do you think will rule this kingdom? now open this door!}
<A>__{the jailer obeys. the princess can barely contain her shock at the sight of wallace; the jailers snatch him upright.}
<C>__{jailer}
<D>__{on your feet, you filth!}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{stop! leave me!}
<P>__{(they hesitate)}
<D>__{there is no way out of this hell! leave me with him!}
<A>__{reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they can still see her back and hear her. looking at wallace's eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. wallace tries to distract her.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{m'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{sir, i... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{will he show mercy to my country? will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{mercy... is to die quickly. perhaps even live in the tower. in time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{if i swear to him, then everything i am is dead already.}
<A>__{she wants to plead, she wants to scream. she can't stop the tears. and the jailers are watching.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger.}
<A>__{she almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him but she doesn't care. she whispers, pleading...}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{you will die! it will be awful!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{every man dies. not every man really lives.}
<A>__{she pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers...}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{drink this! it will dull your pain.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{it will numb my wits, and i must have them all. if i'm senseless, or if i wail, then longshanks will have broken me.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i can't bear the thought of your torture. take it!}
<A>__{on the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. the jailers, seeing suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. from inside the mask, he watches her go. when the door clangs shut, he spits the purple drug out through the mouth hole.}
