<L>__{interior "winter palace," russia late night, 1941}
<A>__{benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively into the empty lobby... he slows, seeing elizabeth abbott in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's not the first time for her...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i can't sleep...}
<A>__{she's quiet... she finally looks up... but doesn't say anything... there's an awkward moment...exacerbated by the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{i was going to make some tea...would you like some?}
<A>__{she shakes her head no... he crosses through the empty bar, into an old kitchen... he looks for tea... puts water in a kettle... as he watches the kettle boil... elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she were chilled, stands by the door... benjamin, without asking, takes a cup for her...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{milk...? honey...?}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{some honey, thank you.}
<A>__{he finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies in with the sweet syrup he asks...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{do you like flies with your tea?}
<A>__{she smiles...for the first time... a thin smile... he starts to stir the tea... elizabeth stopping him...}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{you must let it steep for a minute...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{steep?}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{sit. there's a proper way to make tea.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{where i'm from, they just want it to be hot.}
<A>__{she doesn't smile. he gives her a cup of tea... she cradles the cup... they're quiet, drinking their tea...two strangers... after some moments...}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{you're a seaman? i don't mean to be rude...but aren't you rather old to be working on a boat?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{there's no age limit... as long as you can do the work...}
<A>__{she nods... they're quiet again. she sits at an old wood counter.}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{you have trouble sleeping?}
<A>__{it's an invitation to sit with her... he pulls a stool over sitting across from her...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i didn't know i did... i usually sleep like a baby. something kept me up.}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{i never sleep... well, rarely anyway...}
<A>__{he doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott }
<D>__{my father, when he was in his eighties, was so sure he was going to die in his sleep... he would only take naps during the afternoon... so that death couldn't catch him...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{did he?}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{did he what?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{die in his sleep?}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{he died sitting in his favorite chair listening to his favorite program on the radio.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{he must have known something.}
<A>__{she smiles at the idea... another one... that goes as quickly as it's come... and it's quiet again...}
<C>__{elizabeth abbott}
<D>__{my husband's the british trade minister. we've been here fourteen months... we were supposed to be going to peking... but it just never did work out. it never does seem to work out. have you been to the far east?}
<C>__{benjamin}
