<L>__{interior shopping mall bar. day}
<A>__{ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place. mothers with children, old people and a waitress with attitude. ben tries to order but becomes angry when she doesn't bring it straight away. people begin staring. at the next table a dignified older man sits alone. ben hands sera a small package.}
<B>__{close angle}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there was no time for me to write a card, with you breathing down my neck all day., so you'll just have to wing it, baby.}
<A>__{he laughs and this induces a coughing fit. he downs his drink and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she should bring another.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{she does so. it is a pair of onyx earrings. black onyx set in white gold.}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{your color.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i think you should wear one at a time. one of these... and one of your others. in fact, i was going to buy just one, but i didn't think it would fly... as a gift, i mean.}
<A>__{his new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i will wear them tonight... one of them.}
<A>__{she looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how he is reacting. she smiles and ben takes a deep swallow, finishing his drink. his mood suddenly changes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes... tonight. put it on.}
<A>__{she does so. ben helps her, bringing his face down close to hers.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you'll be able to feel it, sharp and hot under your ear, as one of the brothers is driving your head, face down into one of the penthouse pillows.}
<A>__{they are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said. they sit in silence for a while. sera is close to tears. ben gets up suddenly, puts down a couple of bills and walks away from the table. when he is almost at the door sera gets up and quickly tries together up all of the packages.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{ben, wait... please wait for me.}
<B>__{angle on the door}
<A>__{the dignified older man stands in ben's path and places his hands on ben's shoulders.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{maybe you should wait for her, sir.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{because... you can hear in her voice that she really wants you to.}
<A>__{sera catches up and the man lets go of ben. ben takes the}
<D>__{packages from sera and the two of them step out into the}
<A>__{mall.}
