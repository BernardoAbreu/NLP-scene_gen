<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{watson follows holmes in from the balcony.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible. what a fitting end for trappists now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{do you know what he's talking about?}
<A>__{through the open doorway comes mycroft. in the corridor behind him is one of his aides.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{fraulein von hoffmanstal?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes, mr. holmes. i'm all ready.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{if there's one thing i like about the prussians, it's their punctuality.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{if there's one thing i dislike about the british, it's their climate. i understand your jails are quite damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{they are. but you're not going to jail. you're going back to germany.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{germany?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{you will be conducted to the swiss german border, and be exchanged for one of our agents a man named ibbetson.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{don't thank me. thank my brother. it was his idea.}
<A>__{gabrielle looks at holmes, but he avoids her eyes.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{frankly, i think we are making a very poor deal. you much better than most operatives working for british intelligence.}
<P>__{(turning to holmes)}
<D>__{don't you agree, sherlock?}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(with a small but gallant bow to gabrielle)}
<D>__{and better than some consulting detectives.}
<A>__{mycroft signals to his aide, who comes in from the corridor and picks up gabrielle's bag.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{shall we?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(reaching for parasol)}
<D>__{i will take that.}
<P>__{(to holmes and watson)}
<D>__{gentlemen.}
<A>__{she turns and walks out the door, mycroft following. watson's bewilderment has now reached monumental proportions.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(folding his arms)}
<D>__{all right, holmes you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want to.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i appreciate that, watson.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{after all, i'm only your official biographer }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{anyway, i don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over strand magazine.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the public has a right to know these things. if she's a german spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings?}
<A>__{holmes crosses to a small window overlooking the courtyard of the hotel, opens it, looks out.}
