<A>__{we follow shifty through a corridor deprived of light and colour. valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller. we open into the front room and valerie's revealed for the first time. at 5'5" with long arms book ended by bony hands and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing goth and is clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by lsd. sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.}
