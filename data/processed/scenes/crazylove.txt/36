<L>__{interior letty's room later}
<A>__{letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. she writes in her organizer. dr. robert emlee, early 40s and in jeans, enters with his own organizer.}

<D>__{hello, letitia. i'm dr. emlee, and i have some questions to ask you...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i did this already.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{it's hospital policy...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{to be interviewed every hour?}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{well, i don't have hallucinations. honest.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{this doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{yeah, and a dimple.}
<A>__{dr. emlee shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i'm afraid lhe's not a doctor.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{psychologist, therapist, whatever.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{patient.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{michael, the man who came to see you, is a patient.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what kind of place is this?}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i apologize for the inconvenience, but i must ask you some...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i want to see my mother immediately.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{we discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i don't think you understand. i won't wait.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{you'll have to. your family agreed to the conditions not to see you when they admitted you to hillview, letitia.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can talk about how that makes you feel, but we can't change the rules.}
<A>__{letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{dr. stone's evaluation from last night indicates you're experiencing a great deal of anxiety, probably related to depression...}
<A>__{letty's pov: dr. emlee continues to talk. his words become more and more distant as the ringing in letty's head grows louder.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{we need to talk about starting you on drug therapy. most depressive personalities benefit from a drug like prozac or maybe zoloft...}
