<L>__{interior the downtown 3 train day}
<A>__{gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall. and he doesn't look at jacob when he says...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{don't play me, jake. you don't think i can see it in your eyes? you don't think i know that look?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{i know it by sight, kid... because i lived it for years. christ, i can even smell it on you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{smell what on me?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{revenge.}
<A>__{jacob just looks away.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{some hedgehog said bad things about your company. it caused the stock to plummet and made those bad things become true.}
<A>__{and jacob now sees the poster that has gordon's attention. it features a pile of money being blown out the window under the caption that reads... "if this looks familiar to you... it's because you're renting!"}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{the man you loved like a father threw himself in front of the uptown five this morning and you want to bring that hedgehog to their knees.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you knew he was dead?}
<A>__{"guardian mortgage... low down payments... adjustable rates."}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{like i said i still love to watch from home.}
<A>__{and now gordon turns to face jacob with...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{so don't insult me by pretending to ask for winnifred's hand when what you really want to know is who to bring down to their knees and how to do it.}
<A>__{and jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i know who.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it was either nassim tariq from the frontier fund, bretton woods from locust or karen molina from esl.}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{does winnie even know you came to see me?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well, not exactly.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{but i'm going to tell her.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{not such a grand idea, pal.}
<A>__{off jacob's confusion...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{see, i have a feeling you're going to want to see me again. and if you tell her we had this little pow wow... she's not going to let that happen.}
<A>__{as jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{look, you seem like a smart kid.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{walk away, dust off your resume and get another job...}
<A>__{as he steals one last glance at that guardian mortgage ad...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{... but do it quick.}
<A>__{and with that, gordon moves for the doors. but jacob steps in front of him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm going to bring them down. whoever floated the rumor for a quick buck.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{it's not worth it. it's a waste of energy and time. see, jacob, nobody gets it... they never did.}
<A>__{as the subway doors open...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{if there's one thing i learned in prison it's that money is not the prime commodity in our lives... time is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and your nine minutes are up.}
<A>__{and gordon gekko gets off the subway... leaving jacob on the train. but right before the doors close, gordon stops and turns with...}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{there are worse ways to go than jumping in front of a train. for instance, could you imagine taking something for your diabetes...}
<A>__{as the doors close...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{.. and end up having it cause you to die of acute pancreatitis?}
<A>__{and as the subway pulls out of the station, jacob moore just stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell that was supposed to mean.}
