<L>__{interior bathroom shower day}
<A>__{ashley is surrounded by steam. she sings an edgy gangsta rap tune by nwa. tres' bizarre, non? shampoo lather cascades down her face. her eyes close. she is oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of her. the spider gets clear as ashley rinses off the soap. ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. the lather builds. covering her face. forcing her eyes closed once more. the spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes. the water stops. ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web. she feels no water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. reaching with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth. as ashley retrieves it, the spider scurries onto its opposite side. ashley wipes the soap off her face. the spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand. before it can strike, ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth. the cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. as the beast stares out from under it, barefoot ashley steps on the cloth. crushing the spider without ever knowing it was there. ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. she cranks the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again. the handles suddenly pop off. dozens of tiny spiders pour from the holes onto the floor. ashley shrieks in horror. sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower door. she drags ashley out and looks at all the little spiders.}
