<C>__{swana}
<D>__{good evening, louis. you seem to be very crowded tonight. can you manage a table near the floor?}
<C>__{headwaiter}
<D>__{certainly, your highness, this way please... count d'algout made the reservation this afternoon.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{count d'algout...}
<C>__{headwaiter}
<D>__{it is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.}
<A>__{swana has grasped the situation by now.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{no, that's another party.}
<A>__{in order to save the situation one of the ladies makes a suggestion.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{why don't we go some other place? it's so crowded here.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(delighted at her luck)}
<D>__{no, no! this is glory! at last i'm going to have a look at that female bolshevik. can you give us another table?}
<C>__{headwaiter}
<D>__{only one in the rear, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{that's perfect!}
<A>__{camera moves with the group as the headwaiter leads it toward a table.}
<C>__{another woman guest}
<D>__{you mean leon's bringing the bolshevik you told us about?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{isn't it divine?}
<C>__{another guest}
<D>__{i wouldn't have missed this for the world.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(very gay, in}
<D>__{anticipation of a}
<P>__{triumph)}
<D>__{now, we must be very discreet. if she sucks her soup and drinks out of her finger bowl, i don't want anyone to laugh.}
<P>__{(everybody in the party giggles)}
<D>__{we must not embarrass little leon. he is going through enough for my sake. we mustn't add insult to injury}
<A>__{by now they have reached the table in the rear.}
<C>__{headwaiter}
<D>__{is this satisfactory?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{thank you, louis.}
<A>__{they sit down. the headwaiter bends over general savitzky, an elderly russian aristocrat, who sits next to swana.}
<C>__{headwaiter}
<D>__{is it to be dinner, monsieur?}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{possibly later. we'll just start with champagne.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(to the party)}
<D>__{i'm only afraid that the doorman may spoil our fun. if only he lets her in!}
<A>__{swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter.}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{your highness...}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{yes, general savitzky?}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. they are very interested in the case. swana suspects her countrymen.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{are they indeed? thank you.}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{they hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{general, please... if you hear any rumors that i am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?}
<A>__{as she is lighting a cigarette a guest suddenly looks toward the entrance and sees leon.}
<C>__{guest}
<D>__{look! there's leon!}
<A>__{joyfully swana looks toward the entrance, as does everyone else at the table.}
<C>__{everyone at the table}
<D>__{oh yes! where? there! oh! how exciting!}
<A>__{close shot leon at the entrance suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes ninotchka, radiant in a beautiful evening gown. swana's table swana's expression freezes as she sees ninotchka. the rest of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence, save for one bird brained little guest, named marianne, who feels it her mission to save the situation.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{isn't she something?}
<A>__{a neighbor nudges her warningly. swana withers her with a glance and rises.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{shall we dance, general savitzky?}
<A>__{swana and the general leave for the dance floor. the guest who has nudged her turns to marianne.}
<C>__{guest}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{another guest}
<D>__{how could you make such a remark?}
<C>__{third guest}
<D>__{swana isn't stupid.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{what did i say? i just said "isn't she something?" i didn't say something what.}
<A>__{close shot leon's table leon and ninotchka are seated and a waiter stands by them presenting a bottle of champagne to leon for his approval.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{is it dry?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{yes, monsieur.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(to ninotchka)}
<D>__{is that right or do you prefer it sweet?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i wouldn't know. the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.}
<A>__{by now the waiter is filling their glasses. ninotchka lifts her glass and looks at it.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it's funny to look back. i was brought up on goat's milk, i had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(gaily)}
<D>__{from goats to grapes. that's drinking in the right direction.}
<A>__{ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne. leon drinks and watches her. the first sip proves a painful surprise. ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad medicine.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{ugh... um... oh...}
<P>__{(slowly the delight}
<D>__{of champagne dawns on her and her face}
<P>__{breaks into a smile)}
<D>__{it's good.}
<A>__{she drinks the whole glass at once. leon looks at her in amused surprise. he drinks too. the waiter fills their glasses again.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink. it's very delicate. do people ever get drunk on this?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{there have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the right toast.}
<P>__{(he raises his glass again fondly)}
<D>__{to us, ninotchka!}
<A>__{they clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other. long shot of the table, including part of the dance floor. as leon and ninotchka lift their glasses again, swana and general savitzky start to dance by the table. swana stops, pretending complete astonishment.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{hello, leon! what a surprise! you of all people! how are you, my dear?}
<A>__{leon gets up. ninotchka watches the scene tensely.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{hello, swana. how do you do, general savitzky?}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(to leon)}
<D>__{you're looking magnificent, leon...}
<P>__{(to general savitzky)}
<D>__{...isn't he, general savitzky?}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{leon knows that swana wants to embarrass him but is embarrassed nevertheless.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{is this your new dress suit?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{didn't i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{yes, swana, you did.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{it's a dream of beauty. he never takes my word for anything, but i was right, wasn't i?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(forcing an introduction)}
<D>__{am i interrupting?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{not at all. your highness, may i present madame yakushova?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{and general savitzky.}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i've some wonderful news for you, leon. it's about punchy... do you mind if i sit down?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(realizing that he cannot prevent it)}
<D>__{no... please...}
<A>__{swana sits down.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(to general savitzky)}
<D>__{general, would you mind making my excuses at our table? i will be back in a few moments.}
<C>__{general savitzky}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{he bows and leaves. close shot all three sitting at the table}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{well, leon, we can be proud of our punchy. he had a triumph at the dog show.}
<A>__{during the following speech, ninotchka's expression does not change. she knows exactly the game swana is playing.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. ha! ha! ha! i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. you should see him strut down the street in it. he looks like a little boulevardier.}
<P>__{(to ninotchka)}
<D>__{you see, count d'algout gave me punchy for my birthday.}
<P>__{(to leon)}
<D>__{you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy, didn't you, leon?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(fed up with swana's tactics)}
<D>__{months, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(to ninotchka)}
<D>__{poor madame yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... i'm sure you wonder what it's all about.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(dry and direct)}
<D>__{not at all.... i understand perfectly, count d'algout gave you a dog. you made it very clear, madame.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{dear me... i must be losing my finesse. if i'm not careful i will be understood by everybody.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(acutely uncomfortable)}
<D>__{there's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{i'm going, leon...}
<P>__{(she rises, as does}
<D>__{leon, delighted to}
<P>__{get rid of her)}
<D>__{but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown, madame yakushova. is that what they're wearing in moscow this year?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no, last year, madame.}
<A>__{swana sits again, as does leon.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{isn't it amazing! one gets a wrong impression of the new russia.}
<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{it must be charming. i'm glad conditions are so improved. i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{exactly. you see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low cut gowns in the old russia. the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you're absolutely right about the cossacks. we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. they had such reliable guns.}
<A>__{leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two ladies fence.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{will you do me a favor? stop talking about the good old days.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{a very wise suggestion, leon. i'm afraid madame and i will never agree.}
<P>__{(she plays her trump card)}
<D>__{the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. i understand everything will be over by thursday. am i right?}
<A>__{ninotchka and leon realize the malice and yet the truth of her words.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you're right, madame, it will all be over by thursday.}
<C>__{swana}
<P>__{(rubbing it in)}
<D>__{it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris.}
<P>__{(she turns to leon)}
<D>__{be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow.}
<P>__{(she rises, leon rising too)}
<D>__{good night.}
<P>__{(ninotchka nods without answering. to leon)}
<D>__{good night, leon.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{good night, swana.}
<A>__{swana leaves the table. leon sits again. the mood of the two has been changed by the problem of their separation, which has been brought before them. they sit in silence for a moment. ninotchka speaks first.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{now i think i need a glass of champagne.}
<A>__{leon fills their glasses. they drink. then leon takes ninotchka's hand.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(trying to break the mood)}
<D>__{quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{a funny story?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, there were two scotchmen. one was named mcintosh and one was named mcgillicuddy. they met on the street.}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no, darling. i will tell you another story, a much better one.}
<P>__{(with deep sincerity)}
<D>__{the only thing that will be over on thursday is the lawsuit. there will be no thursday for us. not next week or any week. we won't let it happen. i will tear it out of the calendar. is that a good story?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{wonderful if one could believe it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you must, darling.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(lifting her glass)}
<D>__{to the loveliest story i ever heard.}
<A>__{they drink. the orchestra starts a number.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(afraid of where the}
<D>__{conversation may}
<P>__{lead)}
<D>__{shall we dance?}
<A>__{they both start toward the dance floor. close shot leon and ninotchka, dancing a waltz at the second turn ninotchka starts to feel the effect of the champagne.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(tipsily)}
<D>__{oo! darling! something is the matter.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{oh, everything is so wonderful! it's getting farther and farther away!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what, darling?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{thursday.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes. don't worry. everything will be all right.}
<A>__{in the gayest mood, ninotchka addresses the crowd on the dance floor.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{comrades! comrades!}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{darling, darling... please!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i must talk to my brothers!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{shhh! shhh!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{don't shush me. i am people! i want to make a speech. i want to overthrow the duchess!}
<A>__{leon starts to lead her off the dance floor.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but, darling, you can't do that.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{comrades! good people of france!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{now, ninotchka... please!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{they are all duchesses here... thousands of duchesses... and i am going to tell them.}
<A>__{by now they have almost reached the powder room.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{no speech?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(as though he were}
<D>__{addressing a little}
<P>__{child)}
<D>__{no speech.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i love you, my little leonitchka!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{and i adore you, ninotchua.}
<A>__{ninotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room. leon wipes his forehead in relief and goes to the bar, followed by the}

<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{give me a double brandy.}
<A>__{close shot door of the powder room a group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly about something which must have happened within. camera goes with them as they go to the manager of the restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened. close shot bar the bartender gives leon his double brandy and leon tosses it off. the manager comes into the shot and addresses leon.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(very excitedly)}
<D>__{i'm very sorry, count d'algout, it is most embarrassing, but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room.}
<A>__{leon stares at him for a second, then turns to the bartender.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{give me another double brandy.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what can i do about it?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{you want me to go in there?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, but i must insist.}
<A>__{the manager bows and walks away. leon gulps down the second double brandy. the camera follows him as he proceeds toward the powder room like a hero going into battle. just as he is about to enter, a very dignified elderly lady comes out, is surprised at his attempted entrance, and glares at him. leon loses his courage and followed by the camera goes back to the bar to strengthen it with some of the dutch variety.}
