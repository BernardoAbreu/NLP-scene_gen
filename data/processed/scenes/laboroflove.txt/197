<D>__{if i had seen you. by the way i'm sorry about your wife. they told me.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{thank you... i'm sorry you had to lie. it must have been difficult.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i asked the officers if you had committed some crime... if they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.}
<A>__{this is the father's own room. very sparse as one would expect. he moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{take these, and if you're up to it, try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here.}
<A>__{maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the blanket around his shoulders.}

<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{beat. the father nods as if this is not shocking news.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{most certainly.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{that's a reasonable assumption.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{doubts? about what?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{about my love for her.}
<A>__{the father nods with understanding as if everything became very clear with that statement.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you don't have to prove anything to her.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i'm not proving to her. i'm showing her. and i know i don't have to. i want to. i've realized, love is about giving. i'm alive, i can still give to her. i want to give her everything i can.}
<A>__{the father studies this stranger before him with great admiration.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{there are some people, including those officers, that are trying to stop me. they mean well. but they don't understand. i wouldn't either if i were them.}
<A>__{maurice struggles with the last words. he slumps back physically drained. the father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from maurice's hands.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i want you to stay here a few days until you're better. you're no use to your wife in this condition.}
<A>__{the father moves for the curtain.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you think i'm crazy too.}
<A>__{the father turns and smiles warmly.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i have spent my life dedicated to love. love of god. love of humanity. and here you are living through love. bathing in it. using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any barrier... if you are crazy, i hope my insanity is not far off.}
<A>__{maurice's eyes well up instantly.}
