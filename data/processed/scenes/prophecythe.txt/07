<T>__{dissolve slowly to:}
<A>__{the sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating expanse of desert. travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens and silhouettes tall, finger like spires of volcanic rock. hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing search. before the night swallows it all whole, come upon the town. it used to be something. but that's long gone. now, wrapped in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell of a place. lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. the ghosts are the majority here. biding their time. waiting for the town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the desert. the wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded up storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of abandoned mining equipment. the corpse of a summer's kite twists slowly on a power line.}
<B>__{on the edge of town}
<A>__{from the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.}
<B>__{on the other side of town}
<A>__{stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. an icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was meant for scores of ruddy faced miner's kids. now it seems to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. on this night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner and the faint sound of children's voices in song. it is a hymn. an ancient, latin one. the melancholy beauty of voices rising and falling in choir.}
<B>__{inside the building}
<A>__{is a school auditorium. on the stage, dwarfed by it, are twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing together as a choir. a young woman, katherine, directs their acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the huge room, look on.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against the peeling facade of a storefront. a mortuary.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the rooms are dark but for one. there, bathed in the flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old general we saw at the opening.}
<B>__{the front door}
<A>__{of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. a small panes of glass beside it is broken by a hand.}
<B>__{in the school auditorium}
<A>__{young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain of centuries. faces white, mexican, navaho. katherine guides them with soft hands. she smiles in pride. they smile back. proud. of her. of themselves and the beauty coming from their mouths. one small, beautiful navaho girl, mary, maybe eight, gets a special smile of special friendship from katherine. the mortuary's front door now stands ajar in the darkness. small shards of glass glisten in the carpet.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{is the dead general. even in the bleached ravages of age and death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride. it takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize someone is there with him. simon in his oversized surplus jacket. his arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if in deep cold. but his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his breath is shallow and uneven. he stares at the old man behind sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the amber glow. holding out two blood stained fingers, simon touches the general's forehead. a new strain crosses his perspiring face. concentration. placing his right palm on the general's chin and the left on his forehead, simon cracks open the dead man's mouth.}
<B>__{in the school auditorium}
<A>__{the hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.}
<B>__{in the mortuary}
<A>__{simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and deeply weary,}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{qui ex patre flioque procedit...}
<A>__{then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...}
<B>__{in the school auditorium}
<A>__{it's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children and congratulate their young teacher. even in this gloomy, crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for support.}
<B>__{at the school building}
<A>__{through the doors out steps the eight year old navaho girl, mary. alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out into the night with sensitive eyes. she concentrates. knows. katherine follows her out.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{hey bright eyes, what's the deal being out here all alone without a coat?}
<A>__{the girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. too perceptive.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{someone's here.}
<A>__{katherine looks out into the night.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, smiling and popping katherine one on the arm.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{pig out on all the cake?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny piece left, but you're gonna have to race me for it.}
<A>__{mary suddenly points past katherine's shoulder.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{when katherine turns mary dashes back into the building.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ha!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you little sneak!}
<A>__{katherine chases after her.}
<B>__{at that moment}
<A>__{simon comes limping up from the road. his breathing's bad now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{he climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor. it's part of the school building long abandoned. doors to classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres. simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. he crawls into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on himself and sucks his thumb.}
