<C>__{jane}
<D>__{has mr rochester not sent for us today?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{why, he's gone away. were you not aware? he left after breakfast.}
<A>__{jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{he's gone to the leas, mr eshton's place, about ten miles from here. i believe blanche ingram is there. she's a great favourite of his.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{i saw her two years ago when mr rochester had a party here. oh, she was a beauty; i daresay the most elegant girl i've ever seen. so tall, with raven hair cascading down her back; i don't know how she'd had it done. she sang a duet with mr rochester. they made a lovely harmony.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{i was quite surprised he didn't make a proposal. perhaps that is his intention now.}
