<L>__{interior city bus day}
<A>__{precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back while wearing her red scarf. the new yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds. all wear the exact same suits and raincoats. precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her. we pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying precious in silence as well.}

<D>__{i liked'd that museum so much i went back by myself... peoples ...they only look when my belly big. they minds all made. but do they know? no. they do not know that i am a girl for flowers and thin straw legs?}
<C>__{precious }
<D>__{if other peoples could see that the way i do, they would see that i am a real person inside.}
<A>__{our long circular pan finally lands on precious' seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from precious' bedroom mirror wearing precious' clothes. the bus grinds to a stop. a man smiles at precious and steps off the bus. the original precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it. precious stops to watch two "society" ladies in hats and gloves push antique buggy style baby carriages along the sidewalk.}
<C>__{precious }
<D>__{miz rain say the longest journey begin wif a single step. i wonder what step they journeys begin on. mama always talk about how there be all different types of welfare. i want filfy rich white folks welfare. mama crazy but mama not stupid.}
<A>__{precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street in tattered clothes. as precious studies him, her expression changes ever so slightly. enormous handwritten letters forming "not stupid" overtake her face as we dissolve to : the page upon which she wrote it.}
