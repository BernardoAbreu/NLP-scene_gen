<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't play games with me. there's nothing more to say.}
<A>__{there is a quiet rage building in jezzie's eyes as she continues to stroke jacob's chest. he tries to relax and give himself over to the movement of her hand. silently she leans over and begins licking his stomach. jacob's eyes close. his stomach hardens. he reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head. slowly, jezzie works her way back up to his chest. her tongue darts in and out suggestively. he eyes are burning with anger. her mouth poises itself over his nipple. she toys with it for a few seconds and then chomps down hard. the bite draws blood. jacob screams. his eyes shoot open. for the flash of an instant he sees a demon hovering over him, a hideous horned creature licking his blood. jacob flies off the bed as the creature hurls to the floor. jacob is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it is jezzie lying at his feet. his head begins reeling. he backs away from the bed, not taking his eyes off jezzie for a second. he backs to the closet and grabs his coat.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{jake. what are you doing? look, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to bite. let me get you a towel.}
<A>__{jacob grabs his wallet and his glasses. he backs toward the door.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{jake, don't. you can't leave. you're not seeing things clearly. the drug's wearing off.}
<A>__{she stands up and begins to approach him. jacob lifts up a desk chair and holds it in front of him. blood is running down his chest.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{jake, don't leave me!}
<A>__{jacob throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries into the hallway. jezzie scurries around the chair and runs to the door. she yells after him, but he is already gone. addendum 10: the end of the movie }
