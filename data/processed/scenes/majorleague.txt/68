<A>__{taylor, hayes, vaughn and the others are dressing out for the game. vaughn is wearing his glasses.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{these things make me look ridiculous.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{drop in the bucket, vaughn.}
<A>__{meanwhile, cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{cerrano}
<D>__{gin and cigarettes not enough for jo buu. i still can no hit curva ball for sheet. i hafta make a sacrifice to him.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{sacrifice? you mean like something living?}
<C>__{cerrano}
<D>__{si. i kill unborn children.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{not while i'm here you're not. that's murder.}
<A>__{cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket a common store bought egg. harris is a little embarrassed at his outburst. cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on his altar. in one swift motion he slams the knife down on it, cutting it into two perfect halves. taylor and the others are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. as the yolk spreads out on the altar, brown emerges from his office.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{all right, let's hit the field.}
<A>__{the locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind harris. he looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then tiptoes over to cerrano's locker. screwing up his courage, he picks up jo buu's cup of gin.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{here's looking at ya, jo buu.}
<A>__{he bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, waiting at the ready, as if half expecting a bolt of lightning. when nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish doll in triumph.}
<B>__{harris}
<A>__{strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. as he emerges onto the field, a hitter in the batting cage swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. away it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide arc. it hits harris in the back of the head and knocks him cold.}
