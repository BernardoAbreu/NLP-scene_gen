<A>__{she picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently she has to put it down.}
<C>__{carlson}

<A>__{there is a long pause. carlson gets the tea ready. finally:}

<A>__{kate stands by the back door, looking out at leo.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{he's a fine boy kate. leopold would be proud. we're aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you deserved the option.}
<A>__{kate nods, trembling slightly.}
