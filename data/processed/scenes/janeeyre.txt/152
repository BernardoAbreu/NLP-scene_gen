<L>__{exterior day. ferndean the grounds.}
<A>__{jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track. her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. she comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars. she walks through them. she finds herself in front of a decrepit elizabethan manor house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. jane stops. standing on the threshold is edward fairfax rochester. he is in his shirtsleeves. he stands strong, stalwart, brooding. his hair is still raven black. he is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a hawk. his strength is undiminished. he walks fifteen paces from the house. it brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass. he is close enough for jane to see his scarred eyes. she walks towards him, silent. a few drops of rain begin to fall. rochester puts out his right hand to feel them. he raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there. he is absolutely still; his expression, serene. jane is very close. she steps on a twig. it breaks with a loud crack, shattering the silence. rochester is immediately on guard, his expression turning wary. he suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of it passing an inch from her face. jane steps back. rochester swipes again. she holds her breath. he seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. he turns and walks fifteen paces back to the house. he disappears into the dark interior. jane starts to breathe again.}
