<A>__{letty opens her drawer to pull out a t shirt. several are rumpled. she starts refolding them when she spots it. there, nestled among her clothes, is a book of emily dickinson's poetry. letty picks it up, runs her hand over the cover and starts reading.}

<A>__{paul and letty walk onto a postcard perfect stone terrace overlooking the garden. paul pulls up a chair for letty and stares out at the scenery.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's prettier here than i thought it would be.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{yeah, i guess it's all right.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{that's a big question.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i hope it wasn't something i did.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{something you did?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that put you in here.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{of course not, no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is that why you're here?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i think we need to talk about some things.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{yes, i suppose so.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this has been really difficult, this whole thing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{these past few weeks, it's made me really go back and examine our whole relationship.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, we've been going out for four years, and it hasn't always been so easy.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{especially this last year.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{especially now.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so, i've been thinking a lot...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i have too, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i talked to ruth a little bit, and i think it's about time...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i know. we can't just keep going through the motions.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{exactly. it's time to make decisions.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{you don't have to say anything else. i've known for a while that this was coming.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i just wish we'd done it sooner.}
<A>__{paul takes letty's hand in his.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{will you marry me?}
<A>__{paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on letty's finger. she stares at it, mesmerized.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i had to smuggle it in here. i guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(by rote)}
<D>__{or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i hope you like it. it's a marquis cut, 1.5 carats. they had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{l}
<D>__{letty?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{it's, it's really nice, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no, you've done a perfect job.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so, what do you say, let?}
<A>__{letty looks him in the eyes for the first time.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{do you think, really, that it's ok to get engaged when i'm in here?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sure. we'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. i already told your mother. i hope you don't mind.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no, no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so will you?}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(working up a smile)}
<D>__{of course. yes. i will. i do.}
<A>__{paul and letty kiss, then hug.}
