<T>__{close on:}
<A>__{the face of minerva "mini" drogues, 18, watching something. she looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. she has a pretty face: large eyes, and pouty mouth. her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. don't bullshit me, because i do... you're thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, i'm begging you. i will gouge out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. i will jam every last kernel of popcorn into my mouth until i suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming of age story.}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. she's wearing a "fuct" t shirt and jean shorts.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no shakespeare set in high school...i promise.}
<A>__{close on: the tv screen. "when animals attack" is on. in a series of quick cuts: a zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. a sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. a pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. an alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started.}
<A>__{mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. we now see she is sitting in the living room of a well appointed studio city hillside home.}
