<L>__{interior mission control day}
<A>__{the telemetry has come in. russert puts it up on the common viewscreen. ship status and all the failures are displayed. it's a disaster.}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{roger. we copy that.}
<A>__{he lets go of the mike. can't help himself.}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{jesus fucking god.}
<A>__{flashback interior ares access tube night superimpose: mission time day 15 dark. someone moves along. and emerges into }
<L>__{interior ares observation sphere night}
<A>__{an icosahedronal slice has been removed from one side and replaced with optical glass. a billion stars are brighter and more numerous than you've ever imagined. gallagher comes in, bumps smack into chantilas. thought he was alone.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{sorry}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{lotsa room.}
<A>__{they lean back against the "floor" for a moment and stare out at a billion and a half stars.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{know the stars at all?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{andromeda, cassiopeia, cetus, lepus, canis minor. we're looking at what you'd see south around midnight, mid may if we were on earth. at about 42 degrees.}
<A>__{he's not showing off. he just really does know. chantilas looks at him, surprised.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{my grandfather taught me to sail when i was a kid.}
<P>__{(fondly)}
<D>__{he made me learn the stars in case all the g.p.s. satellites fell out of the sky at once. he said anyone who put his life in the hands of anything run by batteries was a jackass.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{he sounds like quite a guy.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{he didn't like what he called the easy answer or the quick fix. he didn't want to own anything he couldn't repair himself.}
<P>__{(thinking back)}
<D>__{and, oh yeah, everything automatic sooner or later fails automatically, usually during or immediately before a crisis. he had a lotta damn sayings.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{he wouldn't've approved of this.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{going to mars?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no. that we killed off half the living things on earth. that after we all but destroyed one planet with global warming, we're trying to bring another to life the same way. kinda tricky, don't you think? he woulda said we were asking for trouble.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{it looks like we got trouble. that's why they sent us.}
<A>__{a beat. they go back to staring at the heavens. then }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i don't really get it. you quit being a scientist? you went back to school to study god??}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{i just realized science couldn't answer any of the really interesting questions.}
<P>__{(off robby's look)}
<D>__{there are values that are fundamental to an adequate apprehension of the world in which we live that can't be expressed by equations or experiments. in that, you see the hand of god.}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{acknowledgment of basic values. love, kindness, joy. science doesn't have much use for these. look, ugly theories are wrong. we know it by insight. science doesn't want to accept that. we live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies. but it's modern to think this is little more than genetic imprinting or a tacit communal cultural agreement. that's not a world i cared to live in anymore.}
<A>__{robby stares back into the void. this is not the kind of conversation he's used to, but }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i asked my grandfather once if god existed. he played me brahms' third. then he asked me what good it was? or was it just vibration.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<P>__{(following)}
<D>__{what good is beauty?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{he said if a man could listen to brahms and not believe in god, he was a fool.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{i think i woulda liked your grandfather.}
<A>__{robby turns to him.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you didn't come on this trip because of science at all, did you? that's why they let you come, but you're going to mars to prove to yourself god exists.}
<A>__{yup.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{maybe i will pick up a rock and it'll say so on the bottom 'made by god.'}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{maybe god's more subtle than you are.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you think we're doing something we shouldn't, bud, messing with another planet?}
<C>__{chantilas}
<P>__{(unconcerned) if so, it's because we're supposed to find something out. (then)}
<D>__{let's say we didn't. and we finished poisoning off the earth and everyone was dead in a hundred years. then what was the point of any of it? music, art, beauty, love? all gone. the greeks, the romans, the enlightenment, the constitution, people dying for freedom, ideas? none of that meant anything? i'd rather go out and make a mistake than live in a world that bleak.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no one said jack to me about the greeks and romans. shit, i just came along to fix stuff.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{fooled ya, didn't we. it's okay. no one told the others either.}
<A>__{there's a quiet moment. robby just came up to stare at the stars. wasn't expecting all this. then }
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{there's a reason the planets go around the stars in exactly the same way electrons go around the nucleus of the atom. it's not an accident. there's a design at the bottom of all this. god's watching over you.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i just wish i didn't think he was chuckling.}
<B>__{end of flashback.}
