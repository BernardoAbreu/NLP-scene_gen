<L>__{exterior ray's bungalow}
<B>__{tracking shot on ray}
<A>__{exiting the house as the screen door bangs and shudders behind him. he hurries down the walk. tracking shot ray's pov meurice is rounding the bottom of the lawn and starting up the drive toward the incriminating car. its back door is standing ajar.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{i hope you're planning on leaving town.}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{reacting to the line as he reaches the car. he bends over to throw the sheet over the seat just as meurice walks up behind him.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(his back to meurice; arranging the sheet)}
<D>__{got a problem, meurice?}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{no, you do, cowboy. you been to the bar?}
<A>__{ray is still hunched in the open doorway. he freezes momentarily in arranging the sheet.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...why?}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{you shouldn't have taken the money...}
<A>__{ray doesn't reply or turn around. meurice is getting more strident.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...look at me man, i'm serious. you broke in the bar and ripped off the safe...}
<A>__{ray backs out of the car and turns around.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...abby warned me you were gonna make trouble. trouble with you is, you're too fucking obvious; the only ones with the combination are me and you...}
<A>__{ray looks evenly at meurice. behind him the sheet has been arranged over the seat. he puts an unlit cigarette in his mouth.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...and abby. maybe. but as far as i'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{meurice reaches out and swipes the unlit cigarette out of ray's mouth.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{those things are nothing but coffin nails.}
<A>__{he turns and stares down the street, exasperated.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...look. personally i don't give a shit. i know marty's a hard on but you gotta do something. i don't know; give the money back, say you're sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or something...}
<A>__{mow that his temper is gone, he realizes he has nothing much to say. he shakes his head and turns back down the drive, muttering as he lights himself ray's cigarette.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...it's very humiliating, preaching about this shit.}
<B>__{close shot ray}
<A>__{standing in front of the back door of his car, watching meurice walk away. his right hand rises into frame to deposit another unlit cigarette in his mouth. offscreen, meurice calls from the end of the drive:}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{i'm not laughing at this, ray bob, so you know it's no fucking joke.}
<A>__{we hear his car door slam. after a moment ray exits frame, heading for the house. the camera tracks slowly in to the back window of the car. traces of blood are starting to seep up from the upholstery into the sheet.}
