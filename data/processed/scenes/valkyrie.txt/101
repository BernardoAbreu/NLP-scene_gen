<L>__{interior conference hut briefing room day}
<A>__{a small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. stifling heat. we notice again that the windows are open to let in some air. hitler and his officers hunch over a long, heavy table covered in detailed maps of eastern europe and the soviet union. lieutenants and sergeants continually tiptoe in and out of the room. a general stands beside hitler in the middle of his briefing:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{the eastern front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements.}
<A>__{in other words, they are getting pounded but he can't say that. the general is relived to be interrupted by keitel's arrival. the briefing stops momentary as:}
<C>__{keitel}
<D>__{please pardon our tardiness... you remember colonel stauffenberg?}
<A>__{hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock an unnerving moment. stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him. the moment is broken when the general clears his throat, continuing his presentation.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{as you can see, mein fuhrer, the situation in the east prussian sector is increasingly critical...}
<P>__{(and on and on...)}
<A>__{freyend startles stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table less than half a step from hitler. he is squeezed in between two other officers. we suck in wind when we see who one of them is... colonel heinz brandt the same brandt who carried the bottles of cointreau onto hitler's plane so long ago. he still scribbles in his damn datebook. freyend sets the briefcase beside stauffenberg bumping brandt's leg. brandt looks down at the briefcase long enough to make us nervous. he watches as stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down, sliding the briefcase as close to hitler as possible, leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of hitler's foot. stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at his watch. he can clearly see sergeant adam, the telephone operator. where is his god damn phone call? around him generals talk, hitler nods, but we hear nothing. only the pulse of stauffenberg's heartbeat in his own ears the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm. he looks down at the briefcase the bomb just under his feet. he looks at hitler nodding. the longer we stay, the more excruciating it is. so we milk it. stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm. the annoying freyend is there, whispering in his ear. keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption. stauffenberg makes a gesture to keitel with his hand, indicating a phone call. keitel is not pleased.}
