<L>__{exterior marron estate grounds later that night}
<A>__{the guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi nated in the distance. the guard patrols at his station. inside, the t.v. screens flicker and glow. perched on the top of a slight hill, frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree. he gazes down at the gate house, his face lit softly by the glow from its lamps. all around him the rest of the estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight. after a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap proaches and stands beside him. it's rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i guess you've heard what's happening.}
<A>__{frank nods.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mind if i sit down?}
<A>__{frank shakes his head. they sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought. rachel seems very calm.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it isn't over yet, is it?}
<A>__{frank shakes his head.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he knows he still hasn't got you.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so he'll come again?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the oscars?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{rachel takes this philosophically. she tugs at the grass, thinking.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{when i was back in squirrel hill, i started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday i'd win an oscar. you can understand how important it is that they see me up there if i win.}
<A>__{she looks at him and smiles.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{if everyone of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think it's very dangerous.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know. but i can't stay up here on my hill forever.}
<A>__{they are silent for awhile. rachel lies back on the grass, stares at the sky.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time.}
<P>__{(as frank nods)}
<D>__{how 'bout you, frank farmer? out there on the edge... did you ever do something that didn't make too much sense, except maybe inside you? in your stomach somewhere? something that wasn't smart?}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{i will bet you have plenty. i will bet you do. nobody gets really good without it. and you're good. i know that.}
<A>__{she sits up beside him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't know why all this has happened to me...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... but i do know that none of it's your fault. i hope you can hear me, because this is how i say i'm sorry.}
<A>__{frank accepts.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{so... i'm going to go see if i win an oscar. and i won't worry about it at all. because i've got you to protect me.}
<A>__{frank almost smiles.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{he looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms. he kisses her and lays her down. his body moves over hers. like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.}
