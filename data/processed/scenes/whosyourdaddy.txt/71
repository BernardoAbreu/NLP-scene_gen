<L>__{interior ted's bedroom day}
<A>__{highly modified since the last time we saw it. a large flat screen hangs on the wall. a high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room. ted speaks with uncle billy and helen.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{so far, so good. some of them have real angel potential.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{really? so i'm doing ok?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we're impressed but not surprised, ted. you have your father's impeccable judgment.}
<A>__{dad passes the partially open door. overhearing. he stops.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my father must've been amazing.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{he was in a league of his own.}
<A>__{suddenly ted feels his dad's presence, behind him.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{sorry i }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's okay. you need me?}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(holding a list)}
<D>__{your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.}
<A>__{ted takes the list. gives it a cursory glance. nods to his dad, as if dismissing him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no problem, consider it done.}
<P>__{(to uncle billy)}
<D>__{i had this idea of shooting on location. outdoors, you know? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks. you think that would be a problem?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we'll send you the release forms, ted. our staffers will help in any way they can.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you're the titan of tushies, the general of jism. don't you forget it, ted baby.}
<A>__{ted laughs. completely ignoring his dad. who backs out of the room. unnoticed. neglected. hurt.}
