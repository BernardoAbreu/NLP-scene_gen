<A>__{frances rounds the corner, then sees him: harry, standing by his car, smiling.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{where to?}
<C>__{frances}

<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah. i don't know.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't need to screw around anymore. you don't need dwayne steele or odets or your mother. you need me.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i know, but... there were so many people in there, harry. every time i turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. when i feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.}
<A>__{long beat. she turns and stares at him sadly.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you can't change the things they did to me, harry. only i can do that... by myself.}
<A>__{he nods slowly.}

<P>__{(smiles wistfully)}
<D>__{i hope so, frances.}
<A>__{they hug. together for an instant. then she shivers as if the contact were too much.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(disentangling)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he nods, looks at her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i will be seeing you, kid.}
<A>__{he turns and walks slowly to his car.}
