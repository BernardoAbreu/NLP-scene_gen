<D>__{it's nerves. take another toke.}
<A>__{george reaches out, extending a jointerior suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. the others stand back, startled. jacob grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{before anyone can answer jerry grabs his head, screaming. he turns frantically in all directions.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{help me! help me!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what the hell ... ?}
<A>__{in seconds jerry is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking into a terrific blur. he crashes into frank with the force of a truck. frank slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. he begins gasping and hyperventilating. his eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air. fear and confusion sweep across his face. the men watch, horrified, as frank's terror escalates beyond reason into all out panic. suddenly frank begins howling. he lunges for his bayonet and, without warning, attacks the men around him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{god almighty!}
<A>__{paul spins out of the way as frank's bayonet impales the ground. jacob jumps on top of frank and wrestles him into the tall grass. paul rushes to his assistance. jacob stares at frank's face as frank struggles beneath him. it is the face of a madman.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good god! what's happening?}
<A>__{the sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them. guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{behind you! look out! this is it!}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<A>__{dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. soldiers squint to see. it is a horrifying vision.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they're coming!}
<A>__{gunfire explodes on all sides. suddenly paul flips out. he begins screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. frank is struggling like four men and jacob is weakening in his effort to restrain him. bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. bodies fall. more bodies keep coming. the first wave is upon them. rod shoots into the air. shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like banshees. rod, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of his attacker. agonizing cries accompany his fall. rod yanks the bayonet out and stabs again. in the midst of this madness frank shoots to his feet and slams the butt of his rifle into jacob's back. there is a cracking sound. jacob's eyes freeze with pain. his hands rush for his spine. as he spins around one of the attackers jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into jacob's stomach. jacob screams. it is a loud and piercing wail.}
<T>__{cut on the sound of the scream :}
<A>__{to a sudden rush through a long dark tunnel. there is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a brilliant light. the rush suggests a passage between life and death, but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through a subway station far below the city of new york.}
<L>__{interior subway night}
<A>__{the wheels of an express train screech through the station. jacob singer, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. the sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge. he is dazed and confused, not certain where he is. jacob glances around the empty car. his eyes gravitate to overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. gradually his confusion subsides. shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket, "the stranger" by albert camus. he begins reading. another station blurs by. jacob is a good looking man, of obvious intelligence. he is in his mid thirties. it is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. he doesn't look like one. the subway ride seems to go on interminably. jacob is restless and concerned. he glances at his watch. it is 3:30 a.m. putting his book in his back pocket, jacob stands up and makes his way through the deserted car.}
<L>__{interior subway tracks night}
<A>__{jacob enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. the wheels spark against the rails. the dark tunnel walls flash by. he pulls the handle on the door to the next car. it is stuck. he struggles with it. a lady sitting alone inside turns to look at him. she seems threatened by his effort. he motions for her to help. she turns away. a look of disgust crosses jacob's face. he kicks the door. it slides open. the woman seems frightened as he approaches her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{excuse me, do you know if we've passed nostrand avenue yet?}
<P>__{(she doesn't answer)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(she does not}

<D>__{look, i'm asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.}

<P>__{(speaking with a puerto rican accent)}
<D>__{i no from around here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(glad for a response)}
<D>__{yeah, you and everyone else.}
<A>__{jacob walks to the other end of the car and sits down. the only other passenger is an old man lying asleep on the fiberglass bench. occasionally his body shudders. it is the only sign of life in him. the train begins to slow down. jacob peers out of the window. nostrand avenue signs appear. he is relieved. he gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar. the old man shudders and stretches out on the seat. as he adjusts his position, tugging at his coat, jacob catches a brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the coat's hem. his eyes fixate on the spot, waiting for another look. there is a slight movement and it appears a long, red, fleshy protuberance. the sight of it sends shivers up jacob's spine. it looks strangely like a tail. only the stopping of the train breaks jacob's stare.}
<L>__{interior subway station night}
<A>__{jacob is the only passenger getting off. the doors close quickly behind him. he glances at the lady sitting by the window. there is a fearful expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his sight. jacob reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor to ceiling gates. he is about to push when he notices a chain locking it shut. he stares at it in disbelief.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddam it.}
<A>__{he turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. as he approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. the gate there is also locked. his hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.}
<T>__{cut to jacob :}
<A>__{stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the tracks. a rat scampers by and he gasps.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no way!}
<A>__{he starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere else to go. he juts out his jaw and steps back down. jacob is not comfortable on the tracks. he cannot see where he is stepping. his shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace. the steel girders are coated in subway grime. the oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for support.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddam fucking city!}
<A>__{he wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center track. he reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. two pinpoints of light hurl toward him. then the noise arrives confirming his fear. a train is bearing down on him. jacob looks frightened, not sure which way to go. he steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. he cannot tell which track the train is on. it is moving at phenomenal speed. the station is spinning. the train's lights merge into one brilliant intensity. in near panic jacob jumps across the track as the train spins by. its velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. he clings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths. a few people are staring at jacob from the train. their faces, pressed up against the glass, seem deformed. a lone figure waves at him from the rear window. the train bears them all away. then it is quiet again. for a moment jacob is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. he continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder to the uptown platform.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{jacob smiling. the smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. this exit too is locked. a heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. jacob stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment. a sudden muffled scream alerts jacob that he is not alone. his head turns but sees no one. he hears the scream again. he senses its direction and walks toward the men's room. a crack of light appears under the door. he can hear someone moaning inside. jacob knocks softly and the moaning stops. the lights click off.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hey, is someone in there?}
<A>__{there is no answer. jacob stands silently for a moment, not sure what to do. he can hear whispering. he chews his lower lip nervously and then reaches for the door. it pushes open. the light from the station penetrates the darkness. he gasps. he sees a man tied naked to the stall with another naked man grabbing quickly for his clothes. the bound man screams.}
<C>__{bound man}
<D>__{fuck off! mind your own business!}
<A>__{a third man spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at jacob's throat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you cocksucker! get outta here.}
<A>__{the man's face is barely human. before jacob can even react the door slams shut. the lock engages. the crack of light reappears. jacob can hear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. he backs away from the door. his face is white. jacob turns with full fury and storms the gate. the chain gives wayto his anger. it flies apart and the gate flings open. he stands in amazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete below. the gate squeaks loudly as jacob pushes it aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.}
<L>__{exterior wilmington towers dawn}
<A>__{jacob walks toward the towering shadows of a massive public housing project. it is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic structures. jacob passes through a vast courtyard dominated by the imposing shapes. aside from his moving body everything is still.}
<L>__{interior hallway dawn}
<A>__{jacob steps off a graffiti festooned elevator into a long impersonal hallway. he uses three keys to unlock the door to his apartment.}
<L>__{interior jacob's apt. dawn}
<A>__{jacob enters the darkness without turning on the light. he tries to navigate his way to the bathroom, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance. his effort is unsuccessful. he bangs loudly into a table. a woman"s voice calls out.}

<D>__{jake, is that you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what the hell did you do, move all the furniture?}

<D>__{i moved the couch. that's all.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where to?}
<A>__{jacob crashes into it. a light suddenly goes on. jezebel "jezzie" pipkin, 33, is standing in the bedroom door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that jezzie is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual.}

<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{jacob steps into the bathroom and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. he reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub. jezzie enjoys jacob's nakedness. she reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. his body tenses slightly. jezzie drops her robe. they enter the shower together.}
<L>__{exterior vietnam night}
<A>__{a dense rain falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. jacob is crawling through the underbrush in the vietnamese jungle. his shirt is bloodsoaked. he moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. his left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{help me. someone.}
<A>__{suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. it dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to jacob. it is impossible to see who is carrying it. the light darts near the ground where jacob is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes.}

<A>__{sunlight pours through the bedroom window. jacob is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. his hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done. he is awake. jacob lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. he has trouble finding them. as his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. he sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out of focus shelf behind him. suddenly jezzie enters.}

<A>__{jacob charges into the dark space groping for a light. he finds it. the loft is a disaster area. nothing is standing. jacob runs from room to room. in the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor. jacob rifles through the cabinets. a few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him. he reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom. he opens it. michael's severed head stares him in the face. it is smiling. a scream rings out as the man from upstairs sees what jacob has seen. jacob jumps back, trips, and falls over michael's headless body. it is lying sprawled across the floor.}

<A>__{jezzie stares at jacob with a frightening, powerful glare. the edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. it is an innocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into something else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing. jacob's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. his legs are shaking.}

<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{your capacity for self delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.}
<A>__{jezzie begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him. something about her walk is very unnatural. jacob eyes her fearfully. in the darkness jezzie's movements become increasingly strange and elusive. we see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only to reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room. jacob spins around, confused. suddenly jezzie is inches from his face, although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. her movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your mind is crumbling, jake. no more "army." no more conspiracies. you're dying, dr. singer. it's over.}

<P>__{(with consummate power)}
<D>__{you know who i am.}
<A>__{jezzie appears from the shadows. her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. then, to jacob's horror, she turns around. he is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before. glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable. its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration. its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering. jacob pulls away from it, overhwelmed by confusion. he is rooted in fear. a sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing jacob's hair straight up. it is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. he can barely stand. he struggles to pull himself away. the flapping sound returns, charging at him from all directions. it is as if the darkness itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(whispering to himself)}
<D>__{this isn't happening.}
<A>__{new terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. guns fire and explode past his head. it is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him. jacob yells but his own voice is lost in the melee. terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help. suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance. it is louis. jacob is shocked to hear him. he stands motionless.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{if you're frightened of dying you'll see devils tearing you apart. if you've made your peace then they're angels freeing you from the world.}
<A>__{the voice fades. jacob just stands there, not sure what to do. and then the sounds return. only now they are more terrifying than ever. hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying. jacob looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. all the sounds seem to emenate from it. the more jacob stares at it the louder they become. after a moment, jacob takes a huge breath. we sense a great resolve forming inside him. then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it. new and more terrifying noises assault jacob, attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped. he continues walking toward the creature. in the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. it rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic regularity. doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. the room itself seems like an organic presence. it is alive, angry, and threatening. the creature sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself. it writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury. jacob, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it. as the camera draws closer to the creature's head the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. it is like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness. with superhuman effort jacob grabs hold of the creature. it is like grabbing hold of a live wire. his body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. he is flying in all directions but does not let go. his fingers claw at the creature's head. jacob struggles defiantly with the monster. suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{who do you think you're fighting!}
<A>__{jacob does not respond. it cries out again.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you're fighting?}
<A>__{deep inside the darkness jacob begins to make out the presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. it looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face. it is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask. jacob digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dead silence as jacob sees his own face staring back at him from beneath the mask. it is jacob singer as we first saw him on the battlefield in vietnam. only now his image is pale and lifeless. it takes jacob a moment to realize that he is dead. the recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain. jacob stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him. it bursts forth with devastating sadness. as that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power. hundreds of images from jacob's life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. the demons, the room, jezzie, louis, michael, sarah, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity. we are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly changing field of images. some of the images move, some of the people in them speak. they are not particularly significant memories, in some ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with life and joy. even the painful moments resonate with vital force. some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with jacob. some we have not seen before. there is no order to them, no logic to why they have been recalled. a newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. sarah pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. jacob's father stands in the florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. paul, frank, and jacob play cards on the edge of a rice paddy. gabe rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car. a child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, listening to it talk. a young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. jacob and sarah slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. jezzie looks at jacob and asks "love me a little?" and then it is over. total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful soothing calm. jacob's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in sarah's apartment. he is all alone. the first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. jacob sits motionless, stunned to be back there. the faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. it is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. jacob listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him. curious, he gets up and approaches the corridor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{there is no response. suddenly the music stops. jacob freezes for a moment. he sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.}

<D>__{who is it? who's there?}
<A>__{tentatively jacob moves forward. as he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child. then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. his eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment registering inside him. it's his son, gabe. he is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before. the young boy smiles warmly at his father. it is the smile of an angel. jacob swallows hard.}

<A>__{they hug one another over and over. jacob, overcome, sits down on the stiars. after a moment gabe puts his arm around his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. we sense for an instant that their roles have reversed. gabe reaches for jacob's hand and gently encourages him to stand up. with a sweet tug gabe leads his father up the steps. sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first landing. gabe is bathed in its warm glow. as jacob reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting light. gabe hurries up the last set of stairs. jacob turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. squinting, he cannot see his son. then suddenly gabe steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more. his eyes sparkle with excitement.}

<A>__{with a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the demon. jacob is battling for his very soul and tears at the demon with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. its giant wings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. jacob keeps fighting. he claws, bites, and rips at the wings, decimating their delicate fabric. the demon, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up through the last fragments of the ceiling. jacob does not let go. they burst into the fiery darkness. the room crumbles beneath them and disappears into the void. the abyss opens beneath them. jacob continues his attack. his legs are locked around the demon's waist. his hands dig into her eyes. the demon shrieks and surges downward with awesome velocity. the demon charges into a rocky slope, smashing jacob into its cliffs. jacob claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he can reach. the demon takes a huge chunk out of jacob's arm. jacob screams, grabs a rock, and shatters the demon's teeth. the demon falls to the ground. jacob holds on. all of a sudden the demon begins to shrink. jacob is shocked and struggles to contain it. as it dwindles in size it reorders its shape. within seconds a powerful insect is cupped in his hands. jacob tries to crush it but it stings with such force that jacob's entire body recoils. the stinging persists. jacob hurls himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the creature down. so massive is the insect's attack. however, that jacob's whole body heaves off the ground with each sting. then the attacks subside. jacob waits for the next blow. suddenly jacob's body shoots straight up. his hands fly apart as a new life form erupts between them. he holds on tightly as flesh and blood mold and expand between his fingers. the new body takes rapid shape. it is a child. jacob grasps it with all his might as it completes its identity. he is horrified when he sees it. it is his son.}

<D>__{daddy. let go.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{let go!}
<A>__{jacob does not let up. in an instant his son explodes into a gelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. within its translucent mass a new body is forming. jacob stares at it with growing terror. it is himself. a terrible perplexity fills jacob's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image. he recoils as his own voice calls out to him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you're fighting?}
<A>__{the words shock him and for the first time, he lets go. instantly the image disappears and the jelly like mass dissolves into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. jacob looks down at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. its surface reflects a smoky, unearthly light. jacob gazes into the darkness. he is all alone. the quiet overwhelms him. the only sound is his own breath. he looks around, in all directions, but can see nothing. the camera holds on him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing comes. he is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. he stares at the terrible darkness. a subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath jacob's feet. he steps away from it, but it follows his movement. suddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames. jacob screams and tries to run but the flames move with him, lapping at his legs. he cannot escape them. as far and as fast as he runs the fire is with him. he yells and cries and screams as the fire eats at his lower limbs. he falls and jumps back up again, his hands charred. his eyes grow wild.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh god, help me.}
<A>__{instantly the flames roar and engulf him. it is total conflagration. jacob's skin blisters and turns black. his flesh crackles. writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can find no freedom from his suffering. all at once jacob stops running. he throws his hands up into the burning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. it is a gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond himself. his flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly quiet inside him. through the flames jacob's dark form can be seen as it slowly sits down, like a buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust. he appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate him. gradually the fire dies. jacob's body, his flesh like a charred and brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. an orange glow from the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the final darkness. the screen stays dark for as long as possible. then, slowly, an eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. it backlights jacob, revealing his silhouette. the camera dollies slowly toward him. it approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of jacob's face. it is the face of death. the camera holds on the image. suddenly, with shocking impact, jacob's eyes move. within the crumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still conscious. the eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings of a new light. it is dawn. jacob's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural glow. slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. jacob's eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in the still dark lansdcape. gradually the orbs begin their ascent like a thousand suns rising at the same time. jacob's eyes widen as his new world stands revealed. he is sitting in a garden of light, the rousseau paradise he has visited once before. a sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. the vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft glow. like a gentle breeze michael descends from the light and stands radiant before jacob. he smiles and the air itself seems to brighten. michael quietly approaches jacob's body.}

<D>__{i am with you, jacob.}
<A>__{jacob stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and disbelief.}

<P>__{(speaking with a gentle compassion)}
<D>__{it's all right now. it's over. you've won. you're here.}
<P>__{(jacob stares at him}
<D>__{questioningly. michael}
<P>__{reaches out his hands)}
<D>__{trust me.}
<A>__{softly michael places his hands on top of jacob's head and begins to peel at the charred flesh. layer by layer he strips it away. then, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section with one quick pull. a blaze of light bursts through the gaping hole in jacob's head and beams into the air around them. it is an astounding sight.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on. don't make me do it all.}
<P>__{(his eyes sparkle)}
<D>__{stand up.}
<P>__{(jacob's eyes are burst ing with wonder)}
<D>__{you can do it.}
<A>__{slowly jacob begins to stir. he moves feebly at first, like an old man. his black flesh creaks and cracks and through each sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike intensity.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{stop hobbling. your flesh can't hold you anymore.}
<A>__{jacob nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. his lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. jacob stands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. his face is like a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands, glowing with light. michael directs jacob's vision to the sunrise. it is majestic, almost biblical in its grandeur. great rays of light penetrate vast cloud formations and descend into the garden. slowly the clouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. a massive light complex emerges from behind them. jacob watches, awestruck, as the celestial stairway stands revealed. it reaches down from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace. it touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of teh garden. jacob's eyes are filled with its splendor. michael looks at him and nods.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{go on, jacob. it has come for you.}
<A>__{jacob cannot speak. his eyes are fixed on the stairway dazzling him from afar. he can see angelic forms moving up and down it. suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself floating up into the air. he looks down upon eden sparkling below him. his mouth is wide open as he soars above it. the light pulsating from the stairway is brilliant and thrilling. jacob's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. the stairway grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. it pulls jacob toward it. streams of angels enter the stairway like a fast flowing river. it carries them instantly within its current up beyond the visible reaches of the glittering sky. billowing clouds glow in a parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the stairway reaches beyond all known dimensions. jacob stares at the light that is about to absorb him. it is a moment of total euphoria. he surges into the stream as the brilliant light of the stairway overwhelms the screen. slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller light source. an overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view.}

<A>__{lying on an operating table in a large army field tent in viet nam. the doctor steps away. a nurse rudely pulls a green sheet up over his head. the doctor turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat. two orderlies wheel jacob's body past rows of other doctors and nurses fighting to save lives. a young vietnamese boy pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent. it is a bright, fresh morning. the sun is rising.}
