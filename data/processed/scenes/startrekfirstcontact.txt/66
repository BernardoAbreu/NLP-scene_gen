<L>__{interior hospital emergency room day}
<A>__{picard enters. they've placed a respirator down cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his chest. beverly has just finished giving him an injection with a hypospray. the heart monitor in the background is now beating regularly. the doctor turns to picard.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what did you do to the batteries?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{oh... just a little tinkering. how is he?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{he's stable... for now.}
<P>__{(with meaning)}
<D>__{but it would be better if we could contact... our friends.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes. but until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{that'll be interesting.}
<A>__{a woman's voice:}
<C>__{ruby's voice}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<A>__{everyone turns.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing ruby sloane standing at the front of cochrane's bed. a striking woman in her mid to late thirties dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard day's work. she's wearing an old lab coat. but the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes. she's looking directly at picard for an answer. picard realizes he has to say something. he looks into her eyes and there is a moment here a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the captain just might follow up. but at the moment, he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo...}
<A>__{she looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him without expression, as though probing the truthfulness of his statement.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{ruby, we're going to need a series of cranial x rays tonight.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i have a fresh set of plates at home. i will have them here by eight.}
<A>__{she turns back to cochrane, moves to his side, gently takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{take care of him. he's a very special man.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes, he is.}
<A>__{she looks up at picard, and again there's a slight feeling of chemistry in the air. and then she turns and starts to walk out of the room. picard's combadge beeps. reactions.}
<C>__{geordi's com voice}
<D>__{la forge to picard.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{i think there's someone in your pants.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{excuse me. i have a... telephone call.}
<A>__{picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out of his pants pocket, taps it. ruby watches him a beat, then walks out of the room.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{picard here.}
<C>__{geordi's com voice}
<D>__{captain, we have a problem. i think you'd better get back here.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm on my way. picard out.}
<A>__{picard moves to beverly.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i have to go back to the silo. will you be all right?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i will be fine.}
<P>__{(re: cochrane)}
<D>__{he's a different story.}
<A>__{beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll have to work with as picard exits...}
