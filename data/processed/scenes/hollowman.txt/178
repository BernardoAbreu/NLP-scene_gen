<D>__{if the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good.}
<A>__{linda grabs a tranq gun and heads for the door.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm going!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{linda...it's not safe.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's why i'm going.}
<P>__{(to frank and sarah)}
<D>__{corridor eight is clear. get carter to the lab. we'll meet you there.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{do it.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{matt turns to face the corridor. it's turning red. matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud. opens fire. but the thermal signature disappears into the heat. matt can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. he pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{marco...polo... marco... polo...}
<A>__{his voice keeps shifting. matt fires.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{not even close.}
<A>__{matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane. but his foot isn't hitting anything. he sees a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. he rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. and something lunges through the foam. grabs him, sending him tumbling down the tunnel. matt is thrown against the wall. blood coming from his brow. he scrambles away, spraying more foam. sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and fires. the shape leaps away. the dart flies. doesn't hit. matt scrambles back into a corner. his pistol is empty.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{so... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex girlfriend.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian. get a hold of yourself. you aren't thinking rationally.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{she's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{calm down, sebastian... we can talk this through. it's not too late.}
<A>__{the shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder swirling in clouds behind it. coming toward him.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{c'mon sebastian. don't do this. i'm your friend.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i just feel that our friendship is holding me back. i'm sure you understand.}
<A>__{the door opens. linda reaches through, grabs matt. she pulls him to his feet and through the door.}
