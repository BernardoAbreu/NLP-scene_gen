<A>__{the screen erupts with fire. mickey and mallory's faces appear in the flame kissing passionately.}

<A>__{medium cu of wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face and reading from it out loud. we hear wayne's voice over mallory's singing before the last scene dissolves.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(reading out loud)}
<D>__{'after taking a few days to reflect on your offer, i've come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct. a national tv interview would be very advantageous to both mallory and i. the only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days. however, that is your problem and not mine. i feel confident you'll manage. here's to us making television history. sincerely, mickey knox.'}
<A>__{wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{am i a god or what?}
<A>__{we now see the restaurant adorned with the standard denny's decorum. wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of a greasy meal. in response to his last remark, they all pretend they are praying to him. the team consists of scott, the cameraman, who wears wild t shirts (presently a t shirt with the movie 'she devils on wheels' splashed on the front); roger, the soundman, who wears wild hawaiian shirts and bermuda shorts; and unruly julie, wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time. roger's never seen without his recorder, scott's never without his camera, and unruly julie always has her giant notebook. these dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to wayne's stylish yuppie demeanour. unruly julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. the guys hold out coffee mugs, while julie fills. julie, however drinks straight from the bottle. note: this scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'his girl friday' pace.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{drink up! this is a celebration. this is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. we're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. this is wallace with noriega, this is elton john confessing his bi sexuality to the rolling stone, this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster, this is truffaut setting the record straight on hitchcock, this is a robert capa photo, this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot, this is john reid reporting 'the ten days that shook the world', this is the hippies' bloody palms at kent state, the maysles brothers at altamont, this is the nixon frost interviews...}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{this is raymond burr witnessing the destruction of tokyo by godzilla.}
<A>__{everybody laughs.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what's the schedule, mein fuehre?}
<A>__{as wayne talks, unruly julie writes furiously in her notebook. she never speaks, just writes.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. the day after that they're shippin' mallory. that's when we do the mickey knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{would the network really not run it without the interview?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{are you kidding? the last thing they expected was mickey knox to get up close and personal. they wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything i had given them. i'm not gonna tell mickey knox that. i'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. when i told woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. i'm talkin' an adobe brick. they want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{how immediate is immediately?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{next week's episode.}
<A>__{wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{we don't got enough footage for a hour follow up.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(pointing at roger)}
<D>__{what he said.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit. those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference. all that shit is just filler for the interview anyway. we film a new intro. show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of mickey and mallory. we introduce a new angle... what the prison board is up to. we see some of that new shit, then the rest of the show is the interview. now what's so fuckin' hard about that? oh, julie make a note: i need woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'live at five' broadcast to promote next weeks show. we'll do a feed right from the jail while we're wrapping up with mickey.}
<A>__{unruly julie scribbles in her notebook. wayne snaps at scott.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you too scott, betacam and a remote, keep it simple.}
<A>__{scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats wayne.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{betacam with remote and two way comm link. got it.}
<P>__{(opens eyes)}
<D>__{how about the interview...what camera do you want to use?}
<A>__{wayne closes his eyes.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i see...high contrast sixteen millimetre black and white, and i mean black and white, where the black's black and the white's white. this is for posterity, so fuck video. film! film! film!}
<A>__{wayne pounds on the table. cu of unruly julie writing in her notebook: 'film...film...film!'}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{so unruly julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.}
<P>__{(points at roger & scott)}
<D>__{you two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{when do you want the assembly?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
