<L>__{30b a beautiful sunlight morning. children are playing nearby... sliding}
<A>__{down slides, clambering through a jungle gym. sarah knows this dream know... it's is the worst of all her nightmares. she starts to scream but no sound comes out.}
<L>__{30c the sky explodes into white light. everything is seared by the unholy}
<A>__{glare, hotter than a thousand suns. the children ignite like match heads. sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed. terminator's flesh and clothing are burning, silently. it grips her hand, virgil to her dante in this tour of the nuclear age inferno.}
