<A>__{suddenly, cheryl becomes chilled. she folds her arms around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening. there is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind blowing through the trees. cheryl steps into the forest a few feet then stops. a cry deep within the woods can be heard. she freezes. whispering in the distance grows somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard like that of something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth again. cheryl is about to turn back toward the cabin when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty yards behind her. she stops. no sound. nothing moves. several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. she turns but there is silence again. the winds die down, leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. then, all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry of chaotic noises and movement. snake like vines wrap around her ankles and slither up her legs. tree branches near by begin to claw and rake at her. the force is now moving through the woods toward her. cheryl is able to break the vines and run toward the cabin. she emerges from the woods and into the clearing. the force is still following.}
