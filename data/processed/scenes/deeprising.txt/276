<L>__{exterior beach sunrise}
<A>__{finnegan and trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the beach of the island. they collapse next to each other. finnegan is exhausted. trillian coughs up seawater. they both turn and look out to sea, and the rising sun. trillian reaches into her bra, and pulls out the egg sized diamond. she holds it up. the sun refracts off it brilliantly... trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she heaves it as far as she can into the sea. for the first time since they know each other there is nobody around. no people. no tentacles. and when they look at each other, something else comes to mind besides survival. finnegan moves towards trillian. trillian moves towards finnegan. their lips move closer, closer... and then, down by their feet something explodes out of the water! scares the shit out of them. the audience too. but it's just pantucci. looking waterlogged and shell shocked. coughing up half the sea. finnegan and trillian help him to his feet.}

<D>__{because it's cool, you know, i can always take a walk or something down the beach...}

<D>__{joey...}

<D>__{or i could go for a swim...although, i gotta tell you...if i never get in the water again...}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{joey!!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{ok...ok...you don't have to beg me ...i will stick around...}
<A>__{and then they head the most gut wrenching, spine tingling, teeth shattering roar ever. pure primeval. like no sound or animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. coming from deep}
<B>__{within the island.}
<C>__{pantucci }
<D>__{or maybe not...}
<A>__{finnegan, trillian, and pantucci slowly turn and look inland. we begin to pull back as they all stand up. more strange}
<B>__{noises are heard. from multiple unknown species.}
<A>__{we keep pulling back. revealing more of this creepy looking island. and leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach. we keep pulling back. revealing pieces of the smoldering ship. nearly the whole island is visible now. dark jungles. craggy mountains. maybe the scariest looking place on earth.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{what now...}
<A>__{the "thing" roars again. it's hellacious.}
