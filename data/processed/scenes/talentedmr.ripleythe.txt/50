<L>__{exterior ocean, aboard the bird. dusk.}
<A>__{later and now the boat is sailing again. ripley is sitting in his spot. dickie and freddie are at the tiller.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{come on, frederico, do you really have to go back? at least stick around for the festival of the madonna.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{i don't think so. come back with me to rome. there's this great new club. have some drinks, lotta ladies...}
<A>__{marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. dickie makes a face at freddie.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{do you think you can steer this thing?}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{just point her at capri and avoid the rocks.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{marge maintenance.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{aye, aye.}
<A>__{dickie heads towards the cabin. freddie takes over the tiller. there's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water. from where ripley sits he can see capri in the distance, but he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering him a restricted view. he looks down and there's a flash of flesh, then nothing. then as the boat swings with the waves, he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red painted toes straining. ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely betrayed.}
<C>__{freddie }
<D>__{tommy how's the peeping? come on tommy, you were looking. tommy tommy tommy.}
<A>__{shamed, ripley looks away. he stares at the water, parting before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.}
