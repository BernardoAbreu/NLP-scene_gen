<L>__{15, scud moves to stop him.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, easy cowboy i'm not trusting you with a weapon just yet.}
<A>__{whistler smacks scud in the face with the butt of the car 15 and pushes past him. we hear a crash.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{two black, latex clad, ninja like intruders running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling at break neck speed. then they drop, somersaulting down fifty feet, landing in a cat like stance.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{hit the god lights.}
<A>__{scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of stadium style lights secured to the ceiling. the entire place goes white with uv light, the image nearly blowing out. close on figures' faces they are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin prick openings. whistler trains the car 15 on }
<B>__{the first latex clad figure}
<A>__{who is now removing something from a satchel. whistler fires. the intruder drops the object and cartwheels away. in the blink of an eye, the second intruder has launched himself at whistler, hand springing off the floor, then kicking him in the mid section. as whistler falls back, the second intruder presses forward.}
<B>__{on blade}
<A>__{unsheathing his sword, rushing at the first intruder. whap! the intruder traps blade's forearm, pivoting, planting a boot in blade's ribcage. obviously, the intruder is a serious martial arts student. whap!whap!whap! the two of them go at it, unleashing a flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches. the intruder gets blade in a back choke. he twists out of it, throwing the intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing back off the wall at blade again blade ducks beneath one of the intruder's kicks, then traps the intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist. crack! blade backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks the intruder to his knees. then the intruder reaches for a short sword. in a heartbeat, the sword is out and against blade's throat. just as blade's sword is not against the intruder's. it's a stalemate.}
<C>__{second intruder}
<D>__{stop!!!!!}
<A>__{blade and the first intruder freeze. the second intruder steps away from whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on, and tosses the car 15 to the ground.}
<C>__{second intruder }
<D>__{we didn't come here to fight. we came to deliver a message.}
<A>__{blade looks back to the first intruder. then slowly withdraws his sword. the intruder does the same. blade turns off the god lights. the uvs fade and normal lighting returns. scud and whistler pick themselves up off the floor.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{take off your masks.}
<A>__{the intruders remove their masks. the first is asad, a cautious sufi muslim possessing a restrained nobility. the second is a woman, nyssa. 20 something, with emerald eyes and strong, darkly exotic features. both are vampire.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{my name is asad. this is nyssa. we represent the shadow cabinet. the ruling body of vampire nation. they're offering you a truce. they want to meet with you.}
<C>__{scud}
<P>__{(wiping blood from his nose)}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<A>__{blade holds up his hand, silencing scud's outburst. he nods for nyssa and asad to continue. nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped a cd. she tosses it to blade. still keeping an eye on them, blade slips the cd into a reader. we see a slide show of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera. nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{for decades you've been the thing we've feared the most. but there's something else loose on the streets now }
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{the final still. a blurry, horrific shot of nomak's half turned face and back. we get a sense of distorted, inhuman physiognomy.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{something worse than you.}
