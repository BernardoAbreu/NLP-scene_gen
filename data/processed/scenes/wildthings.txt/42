<A>__{the sky has begun to color. art maddox stands on the grass at the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as... a lone sailboat tacks toward the school. angle on boat sam & jimmy sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip. art watches as jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's good, jimbo. i will see you on monday.}
<A>__{jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something. sam waves him off. jimmy gives art a hard look and heads for the grass.}
<C>__{sam }
<P>__{(to art, nodding after jimmy)}
<D>__{what's left of my sailing class.}
<A>__{art studies the dock between his feet.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.}
<C>__{art}
<D>__{the van ryan family created blue bay. they built the school... sandra van ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.}
