<A>__{sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's side. two hands reach in and yank police guard #2 from the car. he starts to cry out but it's cut short. sid screams as the police guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt. he looks up to see a ghost masked figure move around the side of the car towards his door. he reaches for his gun but it's too late. the ghost has the door open. a flash of silver and the police guard's throat is slit.}

<A>__{sidney screams and screams, beating on the door of the car. it won't open. she's trapped like a caged animal.}
<B>__{in the front seat}
<A>__{the ghost pulls the police guard from the car, then gets in, behind the driver's seat. the ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road. sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road. she turns to the door, beating and clawing at it. she leans back, manic, and kicks at the window with her feet. no use.}
