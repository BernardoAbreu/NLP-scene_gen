<A>__{the hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding. billy passes by and halts, removing his knife. with his other hand he pulls down from overhead a thick vine, severing it. a thin stream of water emerges which he drinks. suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the ground. he quietly releases the vine and brings his m 203 shotgun to bear, listening intently. something seems wrong. he brings his eyes upward and stares, hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside. as his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined canopy, he is engulfed by the rising sounds of the jungle, a cacophony of buzzing and clicking, amplified in the sweltering heat of the day. unable to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he relaxes, moving on, resuming the track. billy (minutes later) examines the ground as he moves, growing confused and puzzled by what he sees before him. he stops, scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him with his keen senses. hearing a faint rustling sound he looks up, seeing a curtain of moss several feet away. he takes a cautious step forward, extending his weapon. he reaches forward with his free hand, touching the moss. behind the curtain a slight shifting of dark forms occurs. he pauses and then with a sudden movement, sweeps the moss aside... a black explosion of fluttering wings as carrion eating birds rush past billy's body. billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his expression descending into a state of complete, primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches away from the leering death grin of a human face, upside down, completely stripped of skin. reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him, he stumbles backwards and stops. vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the bodies of three men, skinned and gutted, hang suspended in the think, suffocating air, buzzing with insects. billy turns away, revulsed as ramirez moves quietly}
