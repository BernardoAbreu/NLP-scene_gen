<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{this came for you.}
<L>__{interior hadley's office day}
<A>__{hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. hadley pops the cassette into the vcr. on the screen we see sami speaking into a video camera.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{since we're such good pals i thought i'd sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work. i call it, "i am a scum sucking fbi agent".}
<A>__{on the television screen we see hadley and sami in the park on their first meeting.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{you want the tapes for yourself. you're going to sell them.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{i'm going to retire with a shit load of money. find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{you didn't have to kill sophie.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{yes i did. lose ends are messy.}
<A>__{the color drains from hadley's face. sami reappears, talking into the camera again.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{it's a little arty i know, but it has great content, don't you think? you were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera. it was on the statue. anyway, i've sent a copy of the whole tape to the chicago p.d. and the fbi. they'll get it tomorrow. if i were you i'd take the day off.}
<A>__{the tape turns to static. hadley tries to think. he takes the vhs tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to dial a number. a beat. he thinks better of it, hangs up and uses his cell phone.}
