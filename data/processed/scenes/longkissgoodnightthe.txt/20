<L>__{interior boiler room day or night, impossible to tell}
<A>__{underground. water gurgles through overhead pipes. furnaces hum and tick in the sweaty gloom. a shirtless man is tied to a chair. weeping. before him, what looks like a young gq model. blonde. gorgeous. impeccably attired. for the record, timothy. he looks his captive in the eye as the guy blubbers:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{please, man... i don't know why you gotta kill me... but use the gun, not the knife. please. as a fucking favor, i'm begging you...}

<D>__{last chance. what do you know about a town called santa claus?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what is this, what the fuck is this?? i'm fbi, for chrissake, you can't do this to me. i don't know anything.}
<A>__{timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as though seeing into his brain. he nods, satisfied.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{no. you don't.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can always tell, you know... if someone's lying to me. a little skill of mine, something to trot out at parties.}
<A>__{he slams home the knife. we don't see it, but we feel the impact. the fbi man's face contorts in shock. twisted. inches away from timothy, their eyes lock... a cellular phone beeps. timothy reacts, annoyed. plucks it from his belt and flips it open:}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{timothy.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{message from mr. daedalus.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<A>__{he shrugs at his captive. rolls his eyes. the guy's still dying, still on the knife.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{he says he's sorry, but he needs you right away. something's come up.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{nix. i'm just finishing up here. then i'm going bunjee jumping.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{he's aware of your weekend plans, and he apologizes.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{all right, what's so fucking important?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{your old colleague, one eyed jack...? recently escaped from a high security prison, as you're aware. but listen to this: prior to his escape, seems he saw something on tv that disturbed him. so much he had to be sedated.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{i saw it, too. it's called "empty nest." how the fuck is it my business?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{the man was overheard talking to himself under sedation.}

<D>__{he said charly baltimore's alive, sir.}
<A>__{timothy is silent.}
<C>__{suit}
<D>__{i know it's incredible, sir, but... if she were alive, i'm thinking she might be in contact with the old man in pennsylvania. should i }
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{tap his phone, yes. and tell daedalus i'm on my way. timothy out.}
<A>__{he clicks off, face troubled. withdraws the knife. checks his clothing. not one speck of blood.}
