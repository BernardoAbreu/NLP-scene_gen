<A>__{aokee's is a restaurant near thunder bay. it seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a hawaiian surf and ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like. aokee is a large 375 pound plus apparently hawaiian man, late twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple hawaiian shirt, blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says kiss the cook. we see him on a pay phone behind the counter.}
