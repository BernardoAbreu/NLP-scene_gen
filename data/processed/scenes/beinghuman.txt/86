<L>__{interior cottage day}
<A>__{the mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. she is working on some lace. hector enters the room to watch her. he smiles and stands shyly at the door. the mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. in a flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions for hector to have the good seat. he is full of embarrassment.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no, no... sit down... i just came to watch... please... sit...}
<A>__{he guides the mother back to the good chair. they struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows hector to settle her there. she mumbles unhappily.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{we can't have this... this was arnaud's seat... it's yours now... i can sit on the box...}
<A>__{hector gently pacifies her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you must sit there... look... you need the light from the window... it's your seat... i don't want it... it's yours... i can sit on the box.}
<A>__{the old woman allows herself a shy smile. whether in innocence or mischief, she has secured the best seat in the house for herself. if he stays, hector will never dare rest his bones in it.}
