<A>__{cates shrugs.}
<C>__{cates}

<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you missed ... luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. made a phone call.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{maybe we should pay luther a visit.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{let him get some sleep. he's going to need it.}
<A>__{they move to the bar.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they must have set up a meeting for the morning; luther left an 8 am wake up and put up the "don't disturb" sign. he's trading his girl for the money. all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{so you took the rest of the night off...}
<A>__{hammond smiles.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{we don't have too many cheerleaders in prison. i though i might indulge myself in a little trim.}
<A>__{cates orders two drinks.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{tell me something. why didn't you just take the money off luther and split?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{forget it. i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you...}
<A>__{he opens his jacket slightly. reveals a shoulder holster and accompanying .45. a long moment.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i don't know why, but i'm going to let you keep it. maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because i'm too tired to argue...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you sure that's the reason?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{thanks for callin' in... and i guess maybe... look, i'm sorry i called you watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. i was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{bein' good at your job don't explain everything, jack ...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah. guess not.}
<A>__{hammond gives him a big smile.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{as long as you're feeling like abe lincoln, how about payin' me on our bet? we got time and all this pussy around here's drivin' me crazy. see that one over there, the one i was with...}
<A>__{he nods at candy across the way.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah, i see her.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel. all i need is some money for the room.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<A>__{big smile as cates produces some cash. hammond counts it eagerly. looks around. candy suddenly appears like a trout seeing a lure. she grabs the money.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{hello, again.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i just struck it rich... i think we can do a little business. as a matter of fact, i think we can have a party.}
<A>__{hammond smiles, leads her out of the bar.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{hurry back.}
<A>__{cates watches them go, downs his drink. he fishes in his pocket for a coin, moves to a wall phone. dials...}
