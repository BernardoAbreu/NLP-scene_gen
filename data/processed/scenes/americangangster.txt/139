<L>__{interior tosca's smoking room later day}
<A>__{tosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of cuban cigars.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{now what if i'm just thinking out loud you sold some of your inventory wholesale and i helped with the distribution.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't need it. i already got everything from 110th street to yankee stadium, river to river.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{which is a little mom and pop store compared to what i'm talking about. i could make you bigger than k mart. l.a., chicago, detroit, vegas. i'm speaking nationwide. and i'd guarantee you peace of mind. you know what i mean by that.}
<A>__{frank does. it's a backhanded threat. tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{frank. you can see i'm a renaissance man. unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. ask them, what is civil rights, they don't know. they're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it. but i can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding. that's what i mean by peace of mind.}
<A>__{frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in this matter. still, maybe it's not so bad.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? i'd consider 50. and i can get you as much as you want.}
<A>__{tosca slips on his best poker face. fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{you see, i was right. this is a historic moment. you're going to be bigger than bumpy himself.}
<A>__{he hands frank one of the cigars, expertly prepared.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{can't smoke it here, unfortunately. grace doesn't like it. take it with you.}
