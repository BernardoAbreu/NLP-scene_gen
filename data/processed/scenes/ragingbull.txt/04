<L>__{interior cleveland arena night (1941)}
<A>__{bam! jimmy reeves, a fast, black middleweight, jabs lamotta,}
<L>__{19 years old, in the face. jake staggers forward. no matter}
<A>__{how hard lamotta is hit, no matter how often, he always staggers forward like a bull. the bell sounds. battered, jake slumps on the stool in his corner. it's september, 1941. europe and asia are already at war. young soldiers, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience each screaming at the fighters in the ring. suddenly, words are exchanged, a girl screams, and a soldier and a civilian stand and start swinging. and in the ring: jake lamotta takes a swig of water and spits blood into the bucket his younger brother, joey, holds for him. tony, his trainer, works the cuts.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you didn't have to come to cleveland to get beat by a "moulan yan," jake!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{he's got you, jake! you're outpointed! you're coming up for the tenth. you gotta knock him out!}
<A>__{the bell sounds for the tenth. jake pulls himself up and charges at reeves. reeves slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points. in jake's corner, joey stands and yells at jake:}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{a grand apiece! we got a grand apiece on this, jake! a fucking grand!}
<A>__{jake suddenly corners reeves and unleashes a desperate, wild alley fighting attack. one ferocious punch after another. the spectators go wild; everyone's up for the kill. reeves staggers, then falls to the canvas. the referee counts:}
<C>__{referee}
<D>__{one, two, three, four...}
<A>__{the gamblers call out new odds; ten to one for reeves, the underdog. joey, excited, sees that time is running out and steps in front of the bell. he swings his arms, pretending not to realize he literally holds back the timer's arm for a few seconds. this gives jake more time for a knockout but not enough. joey is pushed back and the bell rings at the count of nine, ending the match. boos and cheers. the bettors scramble back to the bookie to get their money. jake dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting them toward the crowd. joey rushes out and hugs him. the announcer steps into the ring with the mike:}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, the winner, under the rules of the cleveland boxing commission, after ten rounds, by a decision jimmy reeves.}
<A>__{the announcer holds up reeves' arm as his corner tries to lift him off the canvas still out cold. two attendants bring in a stretcher. jake is stunned. he still prances around, now trying to figure out what happened. he raises his arms in victory, and the fans go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting with the cops, throwing bottles and junk into the ring. people go into the ring.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(to jake)}
<D>__{don't get out of the ring. you won the fight let him go out first.}
