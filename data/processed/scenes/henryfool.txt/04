<L>__{exterior the grim house day}
<A>__{moments later. simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. he stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits, sickened. he looks up, though, and sees... a little seven year old girl pearl age seven standing there in the street watching him. simon tries to smile at her. but she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head. he falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. lowering his hand, he sees he's bleeding. desperate, lonely and ill, he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement. fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight fitting dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.}

<D>__{god, i wanna get fucked.}
<A>__{fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{you ok?}
<A>__{simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. he looks back at his sister. fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{see ya later.}
<A>__{simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction. he cocks his head, sits perfectly still and listens. he hears it now. we do, too. footsteps. big ones. like a giant somewhere in the distance. the neighborhood trembles. titles begin. simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, the house, the highway at the end of his block... finally, he focuses on... the blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood. music starts. he kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement. he stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road. the pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of the music over the scene. simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and... puts his ear right down against the road. he hears... the steady tread of somebody very much larger than life. kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, simon opens his eyes and sees... a man approaching. the music swells up full. simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at... this stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane, two over stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders. simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road. henry fool finally reaches him and stops. titles finish. simon says nothing and watches as henry looks off at the house. satisfied, but wary, henry fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at simon.}
