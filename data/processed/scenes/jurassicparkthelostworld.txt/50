<L>__{exterior the plain dusk}
<A>__{ and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in the middle of the roundup. engines roar, wheels spin and dig in the dirt, men shout and radios squawk as the hunter vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed. the hunter shout and shriek with glee, incredulous and thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{look at these things!}
<C>__{hunter 2}
<D>__{they're beautiful, man, they're beautiful!!!}
<A>__{one of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the others. dieter stark stands in the passenger seat, holding a long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it. he swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and shouts to the driver.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{faster!}
<A>__{the driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining on the herd. aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle but the motorcycle roars in from the right side, cutting them off, herding them back out into the open. back in the container truck, peter ludlow stands in a "conning tower," a command post in the heaviest pursuit vehicle. he barks into a walkie talkie.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{alive, dieter, and uninjured!}
<A>__{back on the snagger, the driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints thrown by the herd ahead of him. dieter curses and throws the lasso pole into the back of the jeep. ludlow's voice continues over the radio in dieter's jeep.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{those are very expensive animals! can you hear me?!}
<C>__{dieter}
<P>__{(to the driver)}
<D>__{turn that off!}
<A>__{the driver snaps off the radio as dieter grabs a long barreled rifle from the back of the vehicle.}
<B>__{the motorcycle}
<A>__{guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the plain. from the trees to the left, two heads on enormous necks rise up in alarm. two apatosaurs are startled from the bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain. the herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running, scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their massive legs. one smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of the apotosaurs. the bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the juvenile. another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal. high in the back of the truck, a hunter mans a tranquilizer cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down. he fires and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the neck. its pace slows and another hunter from the truck tosses a lasso around its neck. they crank a winch, reeling in the animal. as the truck gain on it, two six foot padded arms with what look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of the truck. as the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a hydraulic whir, trapping the animal between its airbags. now a pick up rig roars up and drops its back gate. the scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in this dino contaiment vehicle. two hunters throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick up rig. the hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig and it takes off, back into the hunt. back on the snagger, dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat, whips a harness over himself and clicks it into place. he jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard. immediately, a motor underneath the seat hums to life and the seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to dieter raises the gun, picks a carinthosaur, a red crested herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim. bang!! the carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in its left hindquarter. up on the ridge, there is utter quiet. nick and the others stare wordlessly at the spectacle below. down on the plain, the snagger shudders to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge cloud of dust and dirt. the motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its driver pushing his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt streaked face. the wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which clangs heavily to the ground. four wranglers carrying wire noose poles and chains race down the ramp and out of the truck. dieter jumps off the snagger. he puts down his tranquilizer gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly. ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet. the sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance while it is surrounded by the wary wranglers.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{easy easy not too close! full extension!}
<A>__{the wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten foot tall animal.}
<C>__{dieter }
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{almost as one, the wranglers flip their noose over the stunned animal's neck. it thrashes, but the wranglers hold their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it. up on the ridge, nick turns away. he can't watch. down on the plain, a bolero type device, a rope with a round weight at either end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs. the animal thuds to the dirt with a snort of a defeat. ludlow steps up next to dieter and both of them stare down at the helpless animal. ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes glowing. the animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily. dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck. a blue arc of electricity cracks and dances over the carinthosaur's body. the animal convulses in pain, a horrible, high pitched squealing rips the air. dr. burke, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a syringe. he draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and injects it into the animal's thigh. carter, dieter's driver, steps up with a can of spray paint and quickly tags the animal with an id number in day glo orange. dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the dashboard of the jeep and marks a black x over the drawing of the animal.}
