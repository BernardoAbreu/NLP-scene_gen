<L>__{exterior chair lift continuous}
<A>__{the three sit in the freezing chair. lynch is really getting impatient.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{what do you think the worst way to die would be?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's not morbid.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, seriously. that's kinda spooky, dan.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not if it was like one of those surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know. cause it like came up from beneath them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like on the jaws poster.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{the chick on the jaws poster was hot.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{she was?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't know. she was naked. naked chicks are hot.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{but if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. that would be worse than actually getting eaten. knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. and that it's going to eat you. like you're gonna get eaten alive? have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{that's why i only swim in pools.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i think burning to death would be the worst.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well yes and no. because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i remember watching tv for like 3 days straight after 9 11. that footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the trade center? can you imagine how bad it was inside to know that jumping was a better way out?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{but they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{ok, then lynch. what is the worst way to die?}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no, you have an answer for everything. what's your biggest fear?}
<A>__{lynch has been waiting for this.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{easy. the sarlaac pit.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{the sarlaac pit. from return of the jedi? hel lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? worst. death. ever.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{"i don't know why i never have a girlfriend, you guys!"}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{the wind starts blowing again and parker nestles close to dan.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{why hasn't it started again?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{give it a minute.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{this is nothing man. at stowe last year, me and solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. this big chick fell getting off up top and twisted her leg. it was like "move her to the side and keep the line going people". but no. they had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to }
<A>__{boom. the lights go out.}
