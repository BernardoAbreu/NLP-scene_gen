<A>__{a gonzolez tow truck drives up (like the one we saw at the airport), and stops temporarily beside: simon cowell, from the cadillac xlr incident, who stands at the window, screaming at the jaded cashier. his car idles just on the other side of an imposing fence.}
<C>__{simon cowell}
<D>__{just give me my goddamned car!}
<C>__{jaded cashier}
<D>__{don't take that tone of voice with me, sir. i've already told you, we do not release vehicles until all impound fees are paid.}
<A>__{in the e.g., notice ryan skulking closer, behind the gonzalez}
<B>__{auto tow truck.}
<C>__{simon cowell}
<D>__{but i didn't cause it to get impounded! can't you understand that?! it was stolen from me!}
<C>__{jaded cashier}
<D>__{sir, do you want the car back or not?}
<A>__{noticing cowell standing at the window, ryan presses further into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.}
<C>__{simon cowell}
<D>__{yes! but i'm not paying for it!}
<A>__{the cashier signals a grungy yard worker on the other side of the fence.}
<C>__{jaded cashier}
<D>__{nevermind, howie. take 'er back.}
<A>__{howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the cadillac back into the yard }
<C>__{simon cowell}
<D>__{wait, wait! all right you bloody fascist, i will pay. but if there's even the slightest scratch on it...}
<A>__{howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. as cowell angrily starts making out a check, the cashier flicks the switch to open the gate, and as it opens ryan slips in. he sneaks behind the wheel of the idling cadillac. and the moment cowell hands over his check vrrrrooom!! ryan burns rubber out of there.}
<C>__{simon cowell }
<D>__{hey, that's my car!}
<A>__{cowell chases it and watches in horror as ryan takes a speed bump too fast and tears the rear bumper off the cadillac xlr convertible in an explosion of sparks!}
<C>__{simon cowell }
<D>__{noooooooo...!!}
