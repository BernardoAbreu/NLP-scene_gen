<L>__{interior sir thomas' bathroom}
<A>__{sir thomas sinks into his bath. relaxing. the camera slowly tracks in, drip, drip, drip. the silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is magically turned on. sir thomas opens his eyes in panic, as he hears an eerie whisper o.s., like the rushing of wind. sir thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up. can't. not all the way.}
<C>__{blackwood }
<D>__{hello, father...}
<A>__{thomas blinks and sees that blackwood now sits in the corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion. sir thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck as he fights paralysis. he slides back down, slowly.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{you can't fight it. it comes from a power greater than yours. you can only surrender.}
<A>__{the water flows over sir thomas, as blackwood steps closer and takes the sacred ring from his rigid finger.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i've been imagining this moment for a long time...}
<A>__{the water closes over his face. sir thomas stares up at blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{... i must admit, it's better than i thought it would be.}
