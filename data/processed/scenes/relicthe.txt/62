<L>__{interior superstition exhibit night}
<A>__{in the blackness a large shape is moving quietly, dragging it's prey across the floor. we move in on the lifeless form of doyle. his face is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide. the last thing we hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the snapping of doyle's skull.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior museum day}
<A>__{signs announce that the superstition exhibit opens tonight. the museum is back in business, but not many people are going in. a crowd lingers at the margins, pointing at the building. several hold a copy of the post with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair.}
<L>__{interior cuthbert's office day}
<A>__{cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at the scene below. his face is pinched with worry. slumped in a chair is lieutenant d'agosta. pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi's forum sketches.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{if you like them, they're for sale. another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i've read about the museum's financial troubles.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{we've been operating in the red for years. that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit. it was designed to pull people in. we've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. if we postpone at the last minute... no. i don't want to think about that.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(chews on his toothpick, mild)}
<D>__{we all love the museum. i come here myself with my kids. we're trying to work with you.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{i appreciate that.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{if the party goes forward, and that's a big if... i've arranged for a large police presence.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{do they have to wear uniforms?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{i don't want to scare people.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i understand. but mr. cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.}
<A>__{cuthbert looks grim.}
