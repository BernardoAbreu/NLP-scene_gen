<A>__{in a linear left jab. these punches are watched by cassius' eyes in the fifth street gym...studiously studying liston's feet...straight line movement...the jab, linear and straight at us. but it slams into the boxer, not cassius. down he goes. he's out. the referee pulls out his mouthpiece. it's a bloody mess. teeth have been knocked out with it, so devastating is sonny liston... a distant crowd roars.}
