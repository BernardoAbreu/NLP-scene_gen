<A>__{clough walks down a corridor. then runs. then checks himself. slows down. dignity. dignity. but still walks as fast as he can. clough turns a corner to the dressing rooms and the tunnel, then sees peter taylor up ahead entering the tunnel from the pitch with several derby players.. clough stops. taylor looks up. sees clough. their eyes meet. clough's eyes. taylor's eyes. words are not necessary. taylor's smile says it all. clough runs towards taylor. the two men embrace.}
