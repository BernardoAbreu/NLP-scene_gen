<A>__{christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. working hard to advance herself. then a bell rings: time to return to work. other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. as christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. as she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun. she touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. she grabs her belongs and heads back inside.}
