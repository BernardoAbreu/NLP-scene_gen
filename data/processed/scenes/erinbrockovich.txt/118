<L>__{interior ed's office day}
<A>__{ed goes over to his desk, sits down. he sees a stack of messages there, starts flipping through them. then he stops.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{he shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands. he sits like that for a moment, groans to himself. then he pushes himself up and heads over to his door. when he opens it, he finds erin still standing there, exactly where he left her, arms crossed. she hasn't budged.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{how many families we talking about here?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{four more. eleven people. so far.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you think there's more?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.}
<A>__{ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{this is a whole different ball game, erin. a much bigger deal.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{kinda like david and what's his name?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{kinda like david and what's his name's whole fucking family.}
<P>__{(heavy sigh)}
<D>__{okay, here's the deal if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up i will do it. i will take it on.}
<A>__{she smiles victoriously.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you're doing the right thing, mr. masry.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. remind me of that when i'm filing for bankruptcy.}
<A>__{he heads back to his desk. erin follows him into his office.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{course, gathering evidence now, that's a big job. a hell of a lot bigger than just filing. i'm gonna be working a lot harder now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...}
<A>__{he gives her a look. knows what's coming.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{another raise wouldn't hurt. and with all the time i'm gonna be spending on the road, i will probably be needing my own cel phone, won't i?}
