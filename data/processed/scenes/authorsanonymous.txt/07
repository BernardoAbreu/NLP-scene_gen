<L>__{interior henry's apartment day}
<A>__{henry's sparse studio apartment. minimal furniture. his laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates. there are books piled everywhere. all sorts of books. and paper pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment. we are introduced to henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his goodwill couch, watching tv. finally, inspiration. henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment.}
