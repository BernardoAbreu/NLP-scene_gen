<L>__{interior hospital hallways night}
<A>__{james is taking his walk through the hallways, trundling his iv stand along with him like an awkward pet. a white coated doctor vaughan steps into the ward from a room at the end of the hall. he is bare chested under his white coat. his strong hands carry a briefcase filled with photographs, which he pauses to shuffle through, as though checking a map. as james approaches this new visitor, vaughan's pockmarked jaws chomp on a piece of gum, creating the impression that he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards, pornographic x ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses. he sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth, rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrifying act of violence. vaughan looks james up and down, taking in every detail of his injuries with evident interest.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{james ballard?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{crash victim?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{vaughan shuffles his photos again. james manages to make out the shapes of a few crushed and distorted vehicles caught in lurid, flash lit news style. vaughan flips through them distractedly, then with an unexpected, almost flirtatious flourish slides them back into his briefcase and tucks it under his arm.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{we'll deal with these later.}
<A>__{he flashes james an enigmatic smile, and walks off down the hallway. as james turns to continue, a young woman comes out of the same room that vaughan appeared from and moves toward him, using a dark wooden walking stick. she presses her face into her raised shoulder, possibly to hide the bruise marking her right cheekbone. the woman is dr. helen remington, whose husband died in her car crash with james. james stops as she approaches. he speaks without thinking.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{dr. remington...?}
<A>__{the woman looks up at james as she continues her approach. she does not falter, but changes her grip on the cane, as if preparing to thrash him across the face with it. she moves her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck, deliberately forcing her injury on him. she pauses when she reaches the doorway, waiting for him to step out of her way. james looks down at the scar tissue on her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long, running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of her mouth. james is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mauve bathrobe, her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of white plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite armpit like a classic hollywood ball gown. james steps aside. deciding to ignore him, helen remington walks stiffly along the communication corridor, parading her anger and her wound.}
