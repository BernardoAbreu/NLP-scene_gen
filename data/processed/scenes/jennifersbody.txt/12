<L>__{interior kettle high day}
<A>__{chip drums on the sidelines of the devil's kettle high basketball court. the stands are packed with bored students for a pep rally. chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful drummer.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{chip couldn't drum for shit. he only knew "land of a thousand dances" and the solo from "wipeout." lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding.}
<A>__{sure enough, the band is playing "land of a thousand dances." nearby, the flag team claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt. jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform, breathtakingly beautiful. she hoists her flag aloft, twirling it. time freezes as the flag unfurls.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{if you can believe it, that's jennifer. yeah, the same girl i iced with the box cutter. only back then, we were tight. sisters, practically. people found it hard to believe that a babe like jennifer would associate with a dork like me. but we'd been the wonder twins since we were practically preverbal. sandbox love never dies.}
<A>__{jennifer finishes her maneuver and waves to the stands. needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair. chastity, a similarly geeky looking girl standing next to needy, rolls her eyes at this display of affection.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{you're totally lesbigay.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{what? she's my best friend.}
<A>__{the geeky girl mockingly imitates needy's excited wave.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{you stare at her like you want to dry hump her.}
<A>__{needy ignores her.}
<C>__{chastity }
<D>__{like, hump her through pants.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{are you jealous?}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{of what? that rich bitch?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{she's not rich.}
