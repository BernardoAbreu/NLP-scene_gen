It's the cab only, like the sliced-off front of a train engine. Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE, passionately making out on the sidewalk. Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers Luke's massive truck.}

MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.

<ACTION>__{Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back. Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender. He sits, impatient for Max to return. He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque- wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of Max. He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T- shirt, with warm, confident eyes. Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets down the torque-wrench.}
