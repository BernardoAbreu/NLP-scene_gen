<A>__{he pushes shifty hard. chris steps up.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{mate, leave it out!}
<A>__{trevor's on shifty and has him pinned up against the wall, his hefty hand gripped around his neck, suddenly he brings a stanley knife up to his temple.}

<A>__{trevor edges the knife harder into shifty's neck. slowly shifty surrenders the large bag of coke and a cellophane bag of crack with about two grand in cash.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{why do you lie to me you prick, why do you tell me you weren't fucking carrying.}
<C>__{shifty}
<D>__{trevor, you need to calm down.}
<A>__{trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife nestling at the tip of shifty's adams apple.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{empty your fucking other pockets!... now....now!}
<A>__{shifty does what trevor says.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{and the inside pockets you prick... now!}
<A>__{at that moment, trevor lowers his knife, shifty takes heed and grabs him, swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into trevor's face. they fall into a messy clinch, but their now facing the opposite way. chris and shifty turn and sprint as fast as possible. trevor falls to his knees scrambling for the drugs.}
