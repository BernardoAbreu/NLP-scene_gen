<L>__{interior dining car evening}
<A>__{linen tablecloths. fine china. frank is one of the only men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket. frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then another and another... he takes one or two pills from each and swallows them methodically. she watches him.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{are you ill?}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay... you'd be a diplomatic attache or... let's see... a girl from east germany whose father's been kidnapped by soviet agents. they're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. there's usually a microchip involved.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{what awaits me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{trouble, certainly.}

<C>__{cara}
<D>__{is there a man in my life?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{or a candidate for the job?}
<A>__{he gazes at her with a glimmer of hope. she's insanely out of his league. but she's the one flirting with him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe.}
