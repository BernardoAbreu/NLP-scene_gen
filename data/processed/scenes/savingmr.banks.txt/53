<L>__{interior bar lobby beverly hills hotel late afternoon}
<A>__{pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. she spies the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. the elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar instead.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{good afternoon ma'am. what can i fix you?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{a pot of tea.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{sure thing.}
<A>__{pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical mrs travers. the tea pot arrives.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{thank you. tea is a balm for the soul don't you agree?}
<A>__{but the barman has already moved on to another patron. time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go. the barman talks with another customer further along the bar. nobody notices pamela. in this setting she looks like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring into her empty cup.}
