<L>__{interior museum kitchen day}
<A>__{chris takes a beer out of the fridge. then he notices an odd clicking. he tracks the sound to a stove burner permanently on "light." chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. he removes the fuse for the stove. the sparking stops. chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer. gladys enters with a stack of bills.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that burner's on the fritz again.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{oh something's broken? what else is new?}
<P>__{(lays bills on table)}
<D>__{you need to pay these by the end of the month.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(looks at bills)}
<D>__{today... for a split second... i actually thought i had it.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{another vein of iron pyrite?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah... then a rat stole my lunch. i practically blew myself up trying to get it back.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{i'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe you should talk to wade.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{honey, if he really does have a buyer...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{your daddy wanted to get rich. i don't think he cared how that happened. if he was still alive, maybe he'd sell those mines.}
<A>__{chris takes umbrage...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{and maybe you didn't know him so well after all.}
<A>__{a tense beat.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{you're right... i'm just worried about how we're going to pay these bills.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{don't give up on me, gladys. i promised him i'd find the gold. and i will.}
<A>__{gladys steels her fear, patting chris on the hand.}
