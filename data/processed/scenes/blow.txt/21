<A>__{george stands in line to register for college, wearing his brooks brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly bryllcreamed hair. the room is crowded and the line is long. bob dylan's "subterranean homesick blues" blares out of one of the kid's transistor radios. george looks around the room. he is uncomfortable. he catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops. he doesn't like what he sees. something is not right. he looks like everyone else. same cookie cutter hair, same cookie cutter clothes, same cookie cutter faces. he's a carbon copy.}

<A>__{it's george's turn but he doesn't hear it. "twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift." the words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection.}

<D>__{i was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know? and then i looked around the room and it hit me. i saw my whole life. where i was gonna live, what type of car i'd drive, who my neighbors would be. i saw it all and i didn't want it. not that life.}
