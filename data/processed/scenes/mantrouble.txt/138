<A>__{of the circling helicopter: a man, holding onto a life less body, seems to be stalking toward a woman in a defensive stance, standing on the edge of the hill with a stone in her hand.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what were you doing, kissing this guy!?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i wasn't kissing him!!}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(from above)}

<P>__{(to the copter)}
<D>__{i just saved her life, you son of bitches!!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{give me that thing.}
<A>__{she grabs the knife out of his hand, throws it away, then places her arms around him, desperately pantomiming to the helicopter:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{see? he's not hurting me! he's my friend!!}
<P>__{(then, to harry)}
<D>__{this is just for their benefit.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(from above)}
<D>__{don't touch her, buddy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but that's what i am, honey, your friend, that's what i wanted to tell you, and then i saw you with this guy...}

<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(up into the light)}
<D>__{will you please shut up and go away!! this is private! can't you see that!?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just wanted to tell you, because you don't know, how important you are to me...}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(from above)}
<D>__{step away from him, ma'am.}
<A>__{she waves the voice off, trying to listen to harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and i needed you to know this one other thing about me, because i don't want to withhold anything from you anymore...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh god, i don't want to know, harry. what is it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my real name's not harry. it's eugene.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(profoundly relieved)}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(saying it lovingly)}
<D>__{'eugene.' i love that name.}
<A>__{eugene puts his arms around her. the "et ressurexit" from bach's b minor mass begins over the sound of the}
