<L>__{interior exhibition floor}
<A>__{exhibits under glass set up throughout the room: insect chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc. an opening night crowd of affluent museum patrons. all tuxedoes and painted smiles. some peremptorily peruse the displays; most just camp out at the buffet table. peter enters, dressed in his worksuit. he scans the room, sees siri leaning against a wall by the buffet table, drinking an orange juice. he goes over to her.}

<B>__{peter}
<A>__{approaches susan. she's staring through thr glass panes of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons. in the refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem to blend into one another.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{great crowd.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no such thing, baby.}
<A>__{she looks over at the crowd congregated around the buffet table.}

<A>__{siri collapses. the exhibit tips over. peter pulls susan out of the way just as the exhibit falls and smashes to the ground!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{siri!}
<A>__{the room erupts into commotion. susan and peter run to siri, who lies unconscious on the floor. peter gently turns her over. siri's bleeding from the corner of her mouth. just like the chinese workers in the sweatshop. tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.}
