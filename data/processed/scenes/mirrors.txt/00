<A>__{a subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in harlem. a man runs for his life in the deserted space. he's an african american male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform. he turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but the gates are down and the station is closed. desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. he sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside.}
