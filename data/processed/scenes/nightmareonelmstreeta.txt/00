<A>__{nightmare music theme begins as we fade up : on a series of shots, all close and teasing.}
<D>__{ a man's feet, in shabby work shoes, stalking through a junk bin in a dark, fire lit, ash dusted place. a huge boiler room is what it is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal. then we see a man's hand, dirty and nail bitten, reach into frame and pick up a piece of metal. another angle as the hand grabs a grimey workglove and slashes at it with a straight razor, until its fingertips are off. close on same hands dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag. their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp. more angles, even closer. we can hear the man's wheezing breathing, but we still haven't seen his face. we never will. we just see more metal being assembled with crude tools, into some sort of linkage a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus, against a background light of fire, and a deep rushing of steam and heavy, dark energy. and then we see this linkage attached to the glove. then the blades attached to all of it. then the man's hand slips into this glove like apparatus, filling it out and transforming it into an awesome, deadly claw hand with four razor talons gleaming at its blackened fingertips. suddenly the hand arches and strikes forward, slashing through a dark canvas, tearing it to shreds.}
