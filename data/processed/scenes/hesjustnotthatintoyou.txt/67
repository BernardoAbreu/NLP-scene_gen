<L>__{interior mt. vernon row house day}
<A>__{two well built men (skip and larry) sip from bottles of volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting the cabinetry. conor comes into to frame, wearing a toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{hello, my name is conor. please sign in whenever you get a chance.}
<A>__{he gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island next to which anna stands. conor joins her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this is insane. you're like the liza minelli of real estate.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i know. your friend mary's a genius.}
<A>__{the house is teeming with gay couples opening closets, admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{alright. gotta run.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you got a class?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{uh, no. just some stuff. see you later?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{conor goes in for a hug, but anna's not ready for it so he just ends up grabbing her. it's awkward. she leaves, conor tries to play it off, looks around the room. skip and larry look at him sympathetically.}
<C>__{conor }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{she's holding out on you, isn't she?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i'm not sure i get your meaning.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's obvious. she won't sleep with you. it's written all over your puppy dog face.}
<A>__{conor looks at them, decides not to fight it.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{it's killing me. literally. i'm dying.}
<A>__{skip and larry move closer, larry grabs a plate.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{here, have a cookie.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i just i have no idea what she's doing. i cannot read her signals at all. we used to sleep together all the time. well, that's not true, i don't know why i said that, it wasn't all the time. but it did happen i know i'm not making this up. and then, out of nowhere, it stops. but she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages but it never goes anywhere. i mean, what is she doing?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{honestly we may not have the best insight. gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{he's right. like here's "i want to sleep with you".}
<A>__{he looks at larry. larry looks back at him. they don't break their gaze.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{one, two, three that's it. three seconds or more it's on.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{here's "i don't want to sleep with you."}
<A>__{skip look at larry again. larry meets his gaze.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{one, two }
<P>__{(he looks away)}
<D>__{no. thanks for playing. move along.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's that simple.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you're right. that's no help at all.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{but listen i can tell you this. gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. she clearly likes you maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. so the next time you're in the position don't take no for an answer.}
<A>__{skip looks at larry, concerned.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{that sounds like felonious advice.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you're right. let me rephrase. don't take maybe for an answer.}
<A>__{conor takes this in that's not a bad idea.}
