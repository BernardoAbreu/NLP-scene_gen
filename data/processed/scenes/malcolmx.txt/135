<L>__{interior malcolm's home night}
<A>__{betty, pregnant with child, is in a chair a newspaper in her lap. malcolm is in the other room, putting his last daughter to sleep. we hear him... angle bedroom}
<C>__{malcolm's voice}
<D>__{okay, last hug.}
<A>__{as he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening clearly imprinted. he sits down heavily. betty watches him carefully.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{long day. long night. long year. long ten years.}
<A>__{he smiles. she doesn't.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{because you're in trouble.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{dear heart, because i know you.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't want to bring my troubles home. you know that.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm not made of glass.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i just want to sit here and be still.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we've never had a fight. not a real one. but we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{talk about what?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the talk is everywhere!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. don't they say how i'm trying to take over the nation, how i'm getting rich off the nation?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.}
<A>__{she picks up the newspaper and reads from it:}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{"los angeles, upi: elijah muhammad, 67 year old leader of the black muslim movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there are always slanders, always lies. you're reading the devil's lies. can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the messenger.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{"both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since 1957..."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{to bembry? is bembry your friend?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{woman, have you lost your mind? what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{betty gets up, goes to him gently.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, what's the matter with you? wake up! are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? are you so committed you cannot face the truth? bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. ask him why your name hasn't been in "muhammad speaks" in over a year? ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(rationalizing)}
<D>__{i'm not interested in personal publicity. our people know what i'm doing.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{do you know what bembry is doing? you're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{bembry saved my life. the honorable elijah muhammad saved my life.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{a long time ago. you've repaid them many times over. ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{is that what this is about? material wealth?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what do we have, malcolm. a broken down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. we don't even own our own home. what about our children? what about me? you don't even own life insurance.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{will they? are you sure? are you sure or are you blind?}
<A>__{she touches him very gently.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{dear heart, you have to help me. i'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. you don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you want me to do? our people need me.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we need you too!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. if you won't do that for yourself do it for us.}
