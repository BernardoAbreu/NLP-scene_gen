<D>__{listen, you little cooze }
<A>__{and the drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle and sway grabs his hand, twists it ... the drunk groans in agony ... and sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... and drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... cries of "attagirl, sway!" pepper the air ...}
