<C>__{carter}
<D>__{that's all twelve hours.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he never left the room.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{a windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. someone or something killed it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you saw the tape. the man was in his chamber.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{then we have a problem, because i the cage was locked from the outside. that means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. only a human could do that.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{well, it wasn't me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and it wasn't him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{are we sure?}
