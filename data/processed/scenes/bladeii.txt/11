<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rush and jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth. up ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the way. the vampires power on through the barricades, then abruptly brake }
<B>__{the overpass}
<A>__{before them is under construction. there's a twenty foot gap in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re bar poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections. rush and jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear the roar of blade's engine as he comes screaming over the rise in the road! fuck it. rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump, burning rubber as he lands on the far side. jigsaw torques his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.}
<B>__{on blade}
<A>__{as he snaps his hand up a trio of japanese throwing stars appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards. he flings the stars at jigsaw's bike the throwing stars hit jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes down, vomiting sparks as it slides forward. jigsaw is flung forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and whunk! jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re bar! he howls, instantly disintegrating as blade makes the jump!}
<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{rush cuts onto an on ramp, powering his way onto the freeway.}
