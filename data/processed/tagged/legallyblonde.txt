<A>__{"head over heels" by the go go's plays as we wind through a flock of abstract, silky, golden strands — pulling back, to discover that the strands are hair on a blonde girl's head. but not just any blonde girl, a girl in delta gamma, the blondest, most beautiful sorority at usc. we pull back further to see that she's signing a handmade card. she holds it up over her shoulder, we see hearts and glitter surrounding and "good luck tonight!" and "elle and warner forever!." she carries the card out of her room and we follow her across the hall, into the room of — three blonde cheerleaders, who stop practicing their pom pom routine to sign the card. as they finish, we follow the card girl out and into the room of — a blonde girl in a tank top and shorts, working out on a stairmaster as "general hospital" plays on a tiny tv. she signs the card while continuing to exercise. we move on, to the room of— a blonde girl making out with her boyfriend who stops long enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck. she hands the card back and we head into the room of — a blonde party girl who pours a pink frozen margarita into a glass from the blender, then passes it down to another blonde girl, assembly line style. the card goes one way, being signed, as the drinks go the other. once the card arrives back in the card girl's hands, we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door — she puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides the card under the door.}

<D>__{so?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i ' m starting the blonde legal defense fund.}

<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{blondes are discriminated against worldwide! brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. if she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "oh, the poor widow."}

<D>__{what's the point of staying? all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. no one's ever going to take me seriously. the people at law school don't, warner doesn't — i don't even think my parents take me seriously. they wanted me to grow up and become a victoria's secret model who marries a rock star. now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. but i was kidding myself — donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. he saw me as a piece of ass.}

<C>__{elle}
<D>__{first, your honor, i ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will.}
<A>__{the da rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i am aware of the meaning of mens rea. what i am unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of questioning your witness.}

<D>__{then make it.}
<A>__{elle looks at chutney.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{chutney, why is it that tracy marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{because they got wet.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{that's right. because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de activating the ammonium thiglycolate?}
<A>__{chutney pales.}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{yes —}
<A>__{elle continues.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{and wouldn't someone who's had — thirty perms? — throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?}
<A>__{chutney doesn't answer. she just glares at brooke.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and if you, in fact, were not washing your hair, as i suspect you were not, since your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?}
<A>__{chutney continues to glare.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then brooke windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. which would mean that you would've had to have found mrs. windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. isn't that right?}
<C>__{chutney}
<D>__{she's younger than i am. did she tell you that? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, chutney? after you shot your father?}
