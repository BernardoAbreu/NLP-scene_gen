<L>__{interior scout tent. day}
<A>__{the lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. there is a foot locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it, and an empty cot. scout master ward steps inside slowly, bent over, examining the space. he lifts the lid of the foot locker. he looks under the corner of the mattress. he picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow. he opens it and stares at it. he turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside. there is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. scout master ward looks to his staring troop.}
