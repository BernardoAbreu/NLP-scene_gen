<B>__{vince and julius}
<A>__{both with their hands up, look at one another and begin arguing.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i am never going to forgive you for this.}

<D>__{you were going to get killed. i tried to distract him so you could escape.}

<D>__{i had escaped. i was on my way to brazil when i felt you.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{so, why didn't you go?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{because, thanks to you, i'm now not only a godamn psychic, i've got this disease called a conscience!}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{nobody ever said being good was easy.}
<A>__{webster uneasily monitors their argument.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{how am i going to survive out there? what are my friends going to think?}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you haven't got any friends.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{just what are you two talking about?}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(to webster)}
<D>__{butt out, okay? this is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. try brazil.}
<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(cocking his shotgun)}
<D>__{i doesn't work like that, you might talk to people }
<P>__{(aiming the rifle now)}
<D>__{who wants it first.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{shoot him. this whole thing is his fault.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{whatever you want.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{ hold it, don't i get a say in this?}
<A>__{webster points the shotgun at vince, starts to squeeze the trigger when }
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows webster's weapon out of his hands. webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you can be an irritating pain but sometimes you come in handy. where'd you get the gun?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{from the dead man in the car.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(to webster)}
<D>__{you should have checked if he had a gun, chump.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{he said he didn't believe in them.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{i lied.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{ooooh you lied?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i had to.}
<A>__{vince beams with deep fraternal pride. then he turns to webster and snatches the case back.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.}
<A>__{webster shrugs and takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{you got lucky.}
<A>__{he lights it with his lighter. suddenly julius smells something. bad.}
<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{but your luck just ran out.}
<A>__{a stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that webster punctured whilst he was shooting at vince. it runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath julius and vince's feet. webster is holding his cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin erate them.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued benedict.}
<A>__{julius drops the gun and vince slowly hands back the case. webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas, still holding out the cigarette. he stops at the very edge of the building.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{well, i guess this is goodbye.}
<A>__{he raises the cigarette, ready to throw it.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{webster looks up.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you've forgotten something.}
<A>__{webster grips the case tighter.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{julius nods.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{the third rule in a crisis situation.}
<A>__{julian leans calmly against the warehouse wall, supported by one arm.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{the third rule?}
<A>__{julius's hand has pressed a button in a metal cage.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{duck.}
<A>__{suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(even more amazed)}
<D>__{duck?}
<P>__{(can't believe it)}
<D>__{duck? you are developing real style, julius.}
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{drapes his arm around vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you came back for me.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, yeah.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i always knew you would.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you're my brother, right?}
<P>__{(as julius smiles)}
<D>__{we're family, right?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{thank you, vincent.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(with a gleam)}
<D>__{we're a rich family, right?}
<A>__{both reach for the attache case at the same time.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{we're a good family. i'm sorry, vince, but we have to return the money.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{return the money?!? are you nuts?!? this is dirty money, julius it doesn't belong to anybody }
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{ including us think how much better you'll feel when it's out of our lives }
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(almost jumping up and down)}
<D>__{ i won't i won't feel one bit better i will never feel better, not if i live to be... oh no }
