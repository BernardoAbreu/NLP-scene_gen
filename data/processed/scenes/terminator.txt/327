<D>__{why didn't you bring any weapons? something more advanced. don't you have ray guns?}
<A>__{traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges silberman, who nods appreciatively. tight on reese's recorded image he glares at silberman. on sarah, as silberman's voice is heard.}

<C>__{silberman}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{this is great stuff. i could make a career out of this guy. you see how clever this part is...how it doesn't require a shred of proof. most paranoid delusions are intricate...but this is brilliant.}

<P>__{(recorded)}
<D>__{why were the other two women killed?}
<C>__{reese}

<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(recorded, con tinuing)}
<D>__{you can't stop him. he'll wade through you...}
<A>__{c.u. reese, on screen, rising partway out of his chair, yelling.}

<A>__{vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's padding.}
<C>__{vukovich}
<D>__{sarah, this is body armor. out tac guys wear it. it'll stop a 12 gauge round. this other individual must've had one under his coat.}
<A>__{sarah want to believe him. god help her if he's wrong.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{but what about him punching through the windshield?}
<C>__{traxler}
<P>__{(shrugs)}

<C>__{vukovich}
<D>__{why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. it'll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i can't sleep.}
<C>__{vukovich}
<D>__{go ahead. you're safe. there're thirty cops in this building.}
<C>__{sarah}
