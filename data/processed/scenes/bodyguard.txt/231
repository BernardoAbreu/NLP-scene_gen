<L>__{exterior tarmac day}
<A>__{the steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not fast enough for rachel. she jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair. without pausing, she runs to frank who takes her in his arms. they embrace and kiss. they kiss again and again. finally, slowly, rachel draws back, her eyes are filled with tears.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{remember when you said you'd risk your life for me?}
<A>__{frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i didn't really believe it then. nobody means what they say. but you did, frank. you did it. you laid it all on the line for me.}
<A>__{frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't wreck this for me. i don't want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job. you did more than save my life, frank. you showed me a way to be. and i love you for it.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there, i said it.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{i will never forget what it felt like to be under your eye. never.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i won't be forgetting you either.}
<A>__{she presses something into frank's hand.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{here... i want you to keep this. if you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are i will find you. i promise.}
<A>__{she gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane, her eyes holding frank's. frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross.}
<B>__{on frank}
<A>__{as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out. the roar of the plane becomes applause.}
