<L>__{ext night outside aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{it is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, christmas lights in the fake palm trees, tiki lights around aokee's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music. buffet tables line the area, and there is smoothie bar set up. big mike himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while richard is playing bass in the band. aokee is running around making sure all the buffet items are full. everyone is wearing leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except aokee and his staff, who have real ones flown in from hawaii.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(pouring out four smoothies to robbie and alex)}
<D>__{ok. you work hard, and we fine now. your time to party. here they are. special love smoothies. be careful!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{these never fail.}
<A>__{alex picks up two leis from a box behind the counter. he and robbie walk over to amy and katie who are standing over near the buffet.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(to robbie, but if front of amy and katie)}
<D>__{now this will never do.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{i'm afraid you're right. something must be done.}
<A>__{alex and robbie set the smoothies on a nearby table. they remove the cheap plastic leis the girls are wearing. then they put on the real ones they carried over. alex steps back to admire his work.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, yes, yes....}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{perfect. a work of art.}
<A>__{the girls look at each other and smile. alex and robbie grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. amy sips hers right away.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't remember anything like this on aokee's menu.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{they're..}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{..special smoothies. fortunately, you know people on the inside.}
<A>__{onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. now jaffa steps up to the mike.}
<C>__{jaffa}
<D>__{we'd like thank aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's luau.}
<A>__{everyone applauds, aokee waves. alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. robbie nods and smiles as the amy and katie clap as well.}
<C>__{jaffa }
<D>__{we'd also like to bring aokee up to sing one of his hawaiian specialties.}
<A>__{again, everyone claps and cheers him on. aokee goes on stage.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you girls want to dance?}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(grabbing robbie's hand and}
<D>__{leading out to the dance}
<P>__{floor)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{amy shrugs yes and goes out with alex.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(onstage)}
<D>__{mahalo and aloha. this song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. is called e o'mai, or, you are mine.}
<A>__{aokee begins singing the hawaiian love song, "e o'mai". many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. alex, of course, is a goof. he dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to amy's terror. eddie is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. a couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. he holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands. he also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t shirt). he reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them. eddie smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go. the girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle. we pick up robbie and katie dancing.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so. how are things working out at aokee's?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{oh, he's great. alex too. i thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{well, of course this isn't california...}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{no, but it looks like i will get a chance to do some surfing anyway.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and aokee is all over me to enter.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you mean the surfer king?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you've heard of it?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it's all the other girls seem to talk about. this is my first year, but apparently it's a pretty big deal. being from oceanside, you should have a good chance.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{we'll see. it seems kind of stupid to me. a surfing contest in colorado.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{my friends back home would never believe it.}
<A>__{they continue to dance. we see big mike talking to tiffany and gesturing broadly. tiffany is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying. cowboy is nowhere to be seen. suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where eddie is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music. she whispers something in his ear, and eddie's eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor. she wraps her arms around eddie and they dance, all the while glaring at her father. eddie knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, big man on campus. tiffany is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on her shoulder. big mike looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. doug fitzgerald (twenty bucks doug) is dancing with a girl when alex, doing some kind of fancy spin to amy, bumps into him.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{alex. got my twenty bucks?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, dougie. you know, i left my wallet over in my locker. i will see you before we leave and get it to you then.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you know, you could always come by aokee's and i could give it to you in trade.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{cash money, alex. cash money.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{alex grabs amy and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from doug. the song ends, and everybody claps. aokee bows.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to katie)}
<D>__{hey, listen. alex told me about this great spot on the other side of thunder bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet. want to go for a walk?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night.}
