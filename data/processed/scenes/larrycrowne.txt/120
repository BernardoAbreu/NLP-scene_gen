<L>__{exterior tainot townhouse morning}
<A>__{mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean like we've never seen her in the mornings. see the way she holds, not clutches, her thermo cup?}
<L>__{exterior larry crowne's home morning}
<A>__{he's wearing a zipped up jacket. kids and dog walkers pass as his scooter starts pronto, he is off... the for sale sign on his lawn has an addition: in escrow}
<L>__{interior speech 217 later}
<A>__{on the projected computer screen: a portrait of disraeli. dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing mercedes...}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{what a difference from day one. i must be a better teacher than i thought.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{dibiasi is nailing it. calimeris stopped up talking. lala you can't shut up. mack spoke about australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. and larry crowne...}
<A>__{larry is listening to dibiasi, wearing what was once his unimart polo, with his nametag and everything. compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..}
<C>__{mercedes tainot }
<D>__{i was tough on him. but he learned fast. how he connected the circle of sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. i will never forget about the value index now. he gave a perfect speech.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{and... he's polite. instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. what kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? he could have ravaged me. i misread this guy and if i had a brain i'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. i wonder if he'd like that, if he would... what did i just say?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what did i just say about larry crowne?}
<A>__{the class has stopped. it seems that mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it. the women eye each other. the men stifle laughs.}
<C>__{dibiasi}
<D>__{nothing. and i was just wrapping up here.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. please go on.}
<C>__{dibiasi}
<D>__{larry? it okay if i get to my climax and denouement?}
<A>__{larry nods.}
<C>__{dibiasi }
<D>__{thank you... if it was the romance novelist in him that made victoria the queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of ben disraeli earl of beaconsfield educator and prime minister of great britain. not bad for a jewish guy, huh?}
<A>__{dibiasi is done. applause.}
<C>__{pinedo}
<D>__{not so much as a bump, nomad! why'd you go last?}
<C>__{dibiasi}
<D>__{fourth quarter dramatics.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{not that it mattered to my speech professor...}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{congratulations all of you.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{who's the mvp, mrs. tainot? can we vote?}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{not me, i have to stay objective.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{i say... lala!}
<A>__{they all say lala! it's unanimous! they start chanting her name. "la la! la la! la la!" embarrassing her. larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding. it's a spontaneous party that mercedes has to back out of. as she leaves, she looks back long enough to see larry crowne leading a parade around the room.}
