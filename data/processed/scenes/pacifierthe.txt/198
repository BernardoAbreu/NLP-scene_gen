<A>__{from the voltage... bill is off guard, shane kicks his gun away! the gun skids into the acid and plunges, sizzling. bill is incensed, but shane gazes coldly.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{there will be no mercy.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{none requested.}
<A>__{full of himself, bill lunges. and he's strong! he shoves shane back, then punches him in the gut. shane glares, then returns an onslaught of blows. shane's fury is unleashed: a volley of attacks, hitting bill's arms, head, legs! he's crazed, unrelenting. but suddenly mrs. chun leaps onto his back.}
<C>__{mrs. chun}
<D>__{aaaaaa!}
<A>__{she screams and grabs his throat. shane struggles to lose her. suddenly, he drops and flips her. she catapults, stumbles backwards across the room, and stops just inches from the acid! she teeters, tottering, unable to gain her balance. shane shakes his head, then runs to grab her outstretched hand. she smiles, saved. but he's unforgiving.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you're a... terrible neighbor.}
<A>__{shane cold cocks her, knocking her out. suddenly }

<D>__{shane! watch out!}
<A>__{bill is charging him. shane whirls, delivering a roundhouse kick. oof! bill gets slammed in the chest. bill tumbles, the wind knocked out of him. he jumps to his feet, delivering a series of hard punches, which shane deflects they tangle like pro's. it's clear the both have the same training. they punch, spin, kick, connecting only occasionally. bill wheels around and lands a kicks squarely in shane's chest. shane tumbles, landing on his back in front of the safe. angle bill he steps over shane. leering mercilessly, he jabs the spike against shane's throat.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{any last words?}
<A>__{julie gasps. shane narrows his eyes, then whispers sings.}

<A>__{the code! a bell rings, and the safe door flies open! slamming bill in the head! bong! bill's collapses and drops. k.o.!}
