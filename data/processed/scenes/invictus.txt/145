<L>__{interior mandela's office day}
<A>__{mandela leaps up from behind his desk, crosses the room to meet pienaar.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{francois, what an honor. i'm so excited.}
<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{thank you for coming all this way to see me.}
<A>__{pienaar gulps like a fish out of water.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{yes, sir. no problem. thank you for inviting me.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{tell me. how's your ankle?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{my ankle?}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{i was told you'd hurt it. has it healed?}
<A>__{pienaar relaxes, visibly. this is small talk he can handle. this is mandela's gift.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{the truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes ... yes. in sports, and in life. come. sit. please.}
<P>__{(indicating a chair)}
<D>__{take this one. looking into the light hurts my eyes.}
<A>__{they sit in the chairs. a knock at the door, and mrs. brits the old afrikaner tea lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray. mandela stands again, immediately.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{ah, mrs. brits }
<A>__{pienaar stands just a beat slower.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{ you are a shining light in my day.}
<C>__{mrs. brits}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{eyes twinkling, mrs. brits puts the tea tray down on the coffee table in front of them. the finest china, cookies on a plate.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{mrs. brits, this is francois pienaar. he's the captain of the springboks.}
<A>__{mandela clearly expects pienaar to shake hands with mrs. brits. pienaar holds out his hand }
<C>__{pienaar}
<P>__{(afrikaans greeting)}
<D>__{aangename kennis, mevrou brits.}
<A>__{ gently shakes hers.}
<C>__{mrs. brits}
<D>__{ek ook, meneer.}
<P>__{(to mandela)}
<D>__{shall i pour, sir?}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{no thank you, i think i'd like to.}
<A>__{mrs. brits leaves. mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. pienaar only sits after he does. mandela's manners would not be out of place in victorian england.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{how do you take your tea, francois?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{milk and sugar, please.}
<A>__{mandela pours tea for both of them. on pienaar, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the president pouring him a cup of tea.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{the english have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest.}
<A>__{mandela hands pienaar the tea cup.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{both men have big hands. fine china dwarfed and threatened. in the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, mandela looks pienaar in the eye.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{you have a very difficult job.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{i do? i sell gas braais.}
<A>__{mandela lets go and pienaar takes the tea.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{captain of the springboks. a very difficult job.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{not compared to yours, sir.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while i'm doing mine.}
<A>__{pienaar grins. true.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{it is not so difficult to get people to do their best. and i imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes. but to get people to be better than that?}
<C>__{mandela }
<D>__{better than they think they can be? now, that is difficult, i find.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{yes sir, it is.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{how do we do that? by example? to an extent. but there is more to it than that ...}
<P>__{(searching for the right word)}
<D>__{... inspiration, perhaps.}
<A>__{pienaar is engrossed. this is a master lesson on leadership, from a master.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{how do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? how do we inspire everyone around us?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sometimes, i think, by using the work of others.}
<A>__{long pause. pienaar knows to keep quiet.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{on robben island, when things were very hard, i found inspiration in a poem.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{a poem?}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{a victorian poem. just words. but they helped me to stand when all i wanted was to lie down }
<P>__{(suddenly dismissive)}
<D>__{but you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{no! they make a lot of sense, sir.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{on the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes ... yes. everybody is preparing.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{when i think we're ready, i have the bus driver put on a song i've chosen; a theme song. one we all know. we listen together and ... it helps.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes! i remember when i was a guest at the 1992 olympic games in barcelona. the whole stadium welcomed me with a song.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{at the time the future our future seemed very bleak. but to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be south african. it helped me to come home and do better. it allowed me to expect more of myself.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{may i ask what the song was, sir?}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{well, it was nkosi sikelel' iafrika. a very inspiring song.}
<A>__{mandela looks into pienaar's eyes.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{we need inspiration, francois.}
<A>__{brown african eyes, blue african eyes meet over their cups of tea.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations.}
<A>__{something passes between them. whatever it is has a profound impact on pienaar.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{yes, sir. we probably do.}
