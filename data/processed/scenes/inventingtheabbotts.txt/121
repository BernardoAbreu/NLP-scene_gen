<D>__{what do you mean, how do you know?}
<A>__{she sits at the kitchen table and sighs as if coming around to some central, hard truth.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i was just a wreck when charlie died.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{jacey was almost two and i was eight months pregnant with you and... well, some mornings i'd be crying before i even woke up. then you were born. and jacey just got lost in there. i didn't have anything for him. mother took him over. he'd cry or call for me, and then i'd hear mother answer him, and i'd go back to sleep.}
<P>__{(sighs bitterly)}
<D>__{i should've taken us away from here, gone somewhere else.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{after charlie died lloyd abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. he felt so bad about that bet charlie made with him at the lake. that foolish, idiotic bet. poor lloyd i felt sorry for him. he'd have a cup of coffee with mother and me. if a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. he'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. someone dies, people try to be helpful. but he was by here so often that people started to talk. it was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. i suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon i was at woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. all of sudden joan abbott was standing there screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with lloyd. i was speechless. she was gone before i could find my tongue.}

<P>__{(stunned; almost ill)}
<D>__{christ...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i went to see joan, i tried to talk to her, to put her mind at ease, but...}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{dammit, why didn't lloyd tell her that nothing had happened?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm sure he did, but men always say that, darling. besides, lloyd was always having affairs. he's that type of man.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{ahhh, jesus... but why? why did everyone in town believe joan abbott?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{because she's joan abbott. if you cross joan you don't get invited to her parties and the abbotts have the best parties in town. the only parties.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i hate this town. i hate the abbotts.}
<A>__{he slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm sorry, doug, i shouldn't have told you.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i already knew.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{people still talk about it?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{no, i've never heard anyone talk about it. not to me.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{then how did...?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{jacey.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, lord... he knows too?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah. but he thinks it really happened.}
<A>__{helen is overcome with tears. doug stares at her helplessly. he's never seen his mother weep before.}
