<L>__{interior jennifer's (mary sue's) room. night.}
<A>__{she lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing earlier. jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. after a moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting the book. the cover is plainly visible: "lady chatterly's lover."}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{she doesn't have enough light so jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to "her" desk. she sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her. jennifer is deep into the plot and doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. she could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{she flips the page and peers more intently. her hair is bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony tail. after a little while her eyes begin to get more tired and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. jennifer notices something across the desk.}
<B>__{reverse angle.}
<A>__{a pair of mary sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of her. jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances back down at the printerior}

<D>__{hunh.}
<A>__{she can see much clearer now. jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked the photograph of mary sue that sits beside her in a silver frame. the face is the same, but that's to be expected. so is the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look on her face. jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud tap on the window. she rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. jennifer slides open the window.}
