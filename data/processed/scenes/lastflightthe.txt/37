<A>__{the drinking hole in nikki's hotel. a french woman noisily arranges dirty drinking glasses as bill, francis and shep enter horribly hungover, moaning and yawning and line up at the bar. a bartender greets them to take their order.}

<A>__{bartender moves off. shep puts on his dark eyeglasses. carlton bar another view we start on a close shot of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one. beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy. we pan over to the three men:}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{say, we'd better get back to our hotel.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{there's no nikki at our hotel.}

<A>__{francis nods in agreement. shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{not a bad idea!}
<A>__{shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." the three men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one at a time first shep who exhales deeply, then francis who takes it in stride. finally, bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{well, come on, men. let's go.}
