<D>__{i was going to say i knew springsteen's home phone number and i was going to give out the number of the new jersey state police but i thought i might get busted. after i got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. i was putting out a cigarette, like i was told. it was weird. i'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because i'm not allowed to smoke at home, that i got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and mrs. heller looked at me like i'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and i realized what the hell i was doing and i went to put it out and hit the mail box. anyway, i was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that i considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and i was gonna use mrs. heller's home number but is cost too much. i took it again and passed. but i had to work at burger king to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. the car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and i think rooney pocketed the cash. but i can't prove it? i'm in high school, remember?}
