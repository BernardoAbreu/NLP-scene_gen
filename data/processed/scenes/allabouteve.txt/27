<L>__{interior margo's living room night}
<A>__{as margo strolls up, very off hand.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't let me kill the pointerior or isn't it a story for grownups?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you've heard it. about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{remind me to tell you about when i looked into the heart of an artichoke.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'd like to hear it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{she leaves. a short lull. margo looks into cigarette boxes. bill eyes her curiosity, crosses to the fire.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{looks like i'm going to have a very fancy party...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i thought you were going to be late }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{when i'm guest of honor?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i had no idea you were even here.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i ran into eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that never stopped you before.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about hollywood, she seemed so interested...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she's a girl of so many interests.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's a pretty rare quality these days.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she's a girl of so many rare qualities.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so she seems.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(the steel begins to flash)}
<D>__{so you've pointed out, so often. so many qualities, so often. her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection and so young. so young and so fair...}
<A>__{bill catches the drift. incredulously.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i can't believe you're making this up it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{clyde fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't think that's funny!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{of course it's funny this is all too laughable to be anything else. you know what i think about this this age obsession of yours and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stage struck kid }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{twenty minutes!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{thirty minutes, forty minutes! what of it?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{stage struck kid... she's a young lady of qualities. and i will have you know i'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! studying me as if as if i were a play or a set of blueprints! how i walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{stop calling her a kid! it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{for instance what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{for instance you!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you but i'm not going to. i'm too mad }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{ guilty.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mad! darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous on stage and off. i love you for some of them and in spite of others. i haven't let those become too important to me. they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment you've got to keep your teeth sharp. all right. but you will not sharpen them on me or on eve...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what about her teeth? what about her fangs?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy eyed kid by the barroom, benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society i won't have it! eve harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{cut! print it! what happens in the next reel? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{miss channing?}
<A>__{bill and margo look off. eve is in the room. they have no way of knowing how long she's been there.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the hors d'oeuvres are here. is there anything else i can do?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{thank you, eve. i'd like a martini very dry.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<P>__{(he crosses to eve)}
<D>__{what'll you have?}
<A>__{eve, involuntarily, looks to margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a milkshake?}
<A>__{eve smiles, turns to bill.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{a martini. very dry, please...}
<A>__{bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry. as he crosses the stairs, karen, lloyd and max come up from the street level below. general greetings. bill continues up to pantry. eve and then margo come up to add their welcome...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{may i have your coat?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't bother, i can take it up myself...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{karen yields with a "thank you, eve ." eve goes up with the coat. lloyd looks after her approvingly.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i like that girl. that quality of quiet graciousness...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... among so many quiet qualities.}
<A>__{they start for the living room.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm so happy you're happy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{look, you haven't been running a settlement house exactly the kid's earned her way. you had a pretty mixed up inventory when she took over merchandise laying all over the shop...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you've got margo mixed up with a five and ten cent store...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{make it bergdorf goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, max? done up in little ribbons. i could die right now and nobody'd be confused. how about you, max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how about me what?}
<A>__{they've come to a halt near the fireplace.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{supposed you dropped dead. what about your inventory?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i ain't gonna die. not with a hit.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is the most ghoulish conversation...}
<A>__{bill brings two martinis. he hands one to margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(it drips ice)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nothing, really...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the kid junior, that is will be right down. unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i can always get a fresh one. karen you're a gibson girl...}
<A>__{he hands eve's drink to karen. max has wandered off. other guests are arriving. margo gulps her drink, hands bill the empty glass. he puts it on a passing tray. margo takes a fresh one at the same time.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{the general atmosphere is very macbethish. what has or is about to happen?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{what is he talking about?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{macbeth.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{we know you, we've seen you before like this. is it over or just beginning?}
<A>__{margo surveys them all.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{fasten your seat belts. it's going to be a bumpy night.}
<A>__{she downs the drink, hands the empty glass to bill, and leaves them. she passes two women, gabbing by the piano. as they see her:}
<D>__{woman #1 margo, darling! woman #2 darling!}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(passing)}
<D>__{darlings...}
<A>__{she arrives at the landing just as addison comes up with miss caswell. margo takes a drink from a passing tray.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(to addison)}
<D>__{i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{dear margo. you were an unforgettable peter pan you must play it again, soon. you remember miss caswell?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i do not. how do you do?}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{we never met. that's why.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{miss caswell is an actress. a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts.}
<P>__{(his glance is attracted by eve coming downstairs)}
<D>__{ah... eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(deferentially)}
<D>__{good evening, mr. dewitt.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i had no idea you knew each other.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{this must be, at long last, our formal introduction. until now we have met only in passing...}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{that's how you met me. in passing.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{eve, this is an old friend of mr. dewitt's mother miss caswell, miss harrington...}
<P>__{(the two girls say hello)}
<D>__{addison, i've been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time }
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you've heard of her great interest in the theater }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we have that in common.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{then you two must have a long talk }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm afraid mr. dewitt would find me boring before too long.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{you won't bore him, honey. you won't even get to talk.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{claudia dear, come closer.}
<P>__{(she does, and he points)}
<D>__{this is max fabian. he is a producer. go do yourself some good.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{because that is what they are. go make him happy.}
<A>__{miss caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for max. addison puts eve's arm in his.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{you mustn't worry about your little charge. she is in safe hands.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{eve smiles uncertainly at margo as he leads her away. margo looks after them. she downs her drink...}
