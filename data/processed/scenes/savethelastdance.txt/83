<L>__{exterior park sara and patrick later}
<A>__{they lay on their bellies in the grass. close to each other.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i stole a bike here once.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{why'd you do that?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{'cause i didn't have one.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{that's a good reason.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i used to do wild shit like that.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you and malakai?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yep. most of the time.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't get you guys. you seem so... different.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we're not.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{maybe you weren't then but you are now. you said you changed.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{doesn't make me different from him. not the way you think it does.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i think malakai's scary. and i know you're not.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(taking mild umbrage)}
<D>__{what you mean by scary? 'kai's tough. he has to be. he still got a good heart. i know.}
<A>__{sara stares at the ground, struggling to tell him what she saw.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{let me finish. me and him got into some shit awhile back. real bad shit. we held up a gas station off 95. i bailed the ride jumped out the car. 'kai kept goin', got caught.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{i knew what he was gonna do that night. knew the car was hot. i woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if malakai had served my name up. but he didn't.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{that means you owe him something?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{he did his time plus most of mine. i owe him that.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{no matter how much he messes up?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we all mess up. maybe malakai gave up. but he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. i ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else.}
<A>__{he looks at her and she doesn't have the heart or the nerve to tell him. a long moment. she plucks a dandelion from the grass, twirls it thoughtfully in her fingers.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i stole a hat once. when i was twelve. my mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{gangsta' sara. stole a hat. call the f.b.i.}
<A>__{she looks at him. smiles. twirls the dandelion under his nose.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you gonna turn me in?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i think i will wait for you to surrender.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{were you tight with your mom, sara? i mean, y'all get along and shit?}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(guardedly)}
<D>__{yeah...tight... got along and shit}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{so she meant something to you. how come you never talk about her?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{there's nothing to say.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(studying her face)}
<D>__{know why there's nothing to say? because you don't talk about her. you won't talk about her.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sorry she's dead. god! what do you want me to do? run through the streets screaming?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{why not? if it helps.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(tersely)}
<D>__{well, it won't. so drop it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and you call malakai scary.}
<A>__{she looks at him. patrick grins. sara knocks her legs against his. he knocks his legs back. a silly moment. but it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce between them.}
