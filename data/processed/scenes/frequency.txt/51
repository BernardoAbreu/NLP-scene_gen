<L>__{exterior construction site day 1998}
<A>__{a detective's car pulls up next to a couple of blue & whites at west 155th st. the northern tip of manhattan island. across construction barricades is a half torn down greek restaurant. several uniforms can be seen beyond it, looking at something on the ground. as john exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we meet a guy we haven't seen in 29 years satchel deleon, 59. shaved head, square jaw. a ram rod straight, craggy warrior. thirty plus years on the force now endow him with a rare combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.}

<D>__{be real careful when pulling it out. and get the dirt around it.}
