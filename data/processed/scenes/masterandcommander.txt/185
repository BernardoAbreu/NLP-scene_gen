<L>__{186. scuttlebutt dusk}
<A>__{something disturbs the dark surface of the water as hollom dips the ladle and fills his cup. a sense of someone moving up behind him. hollom turns abruptly. it's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. he stares at hollom as he backs away toward the ladder and hurries below.}

<A>__{to reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the berth deck, past howard obsessively cleaning his pistol, another man whittling with a knife, davies adding another link in the tattooed chain about beckett's middle. no one speaks as hollom runs the gauntlet of their stares, acutely aware of his own breathing. it now seems universally to be held that he is the author of all the ship's misfortune. nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight hollom's breath quickens. he stumbles on someone's dunnage, almost trips but is caught before he falls. it's one of nagel's mates.}
<D>__{nagel's mate careful, sir.}
