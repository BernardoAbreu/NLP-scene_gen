<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior frozen willow trees day}
<A>__{anna, kristoff, and sven walk beneath frozen willows. the hanging branches glisten like christmas lights. sven knocks them with his antlers. they tinkle like chimes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i never knew winter could be so beautiful.}
<A>__{suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. we'll call that voice olaf.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{yeah...it really is beautiful, isn't it? but it's so white. you know, how about a little color? must we bleach the joy out of it all? i'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...}
<A>__{while this is going on, anna and kristoff look around for the source of the rambling. they look at sven could he actually be talking? sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are. in the meantime, a nose less snowman, olaf, wanders up behind them.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{how `bout yellow no, not yellow. yellow and snow? brrrr...no go.}
<A>__{he stops between kristoff and anna. they look down at him. how did he get there? he suddenly looks up at anna.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{am i right?}
<A>__{anna screams! reflexes take over and she kicks olaf's head, sending it flying off his body and into kristoff's arms.}
<C>__{olaf }
<P>__{(cheery, to kristoff)}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you're creepy.}
<A>__{kristoff tosses the head back to anna and they commence a game of hot potato.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't want it!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{backatchya!}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{please don't drop me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{come on, it's just a head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{olaf's body runs at anna, arms waving.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{all right, we got off to a bad start.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ew, ew, the body!}
<A>__{anna slams olaf's head back on the body, upside down. olaf smiles happily, then looks confused.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{wait, what am i looking at right now? why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{...okay. wait one second.}
<A>__{anna kneels in front of olaf and rights his head.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{oooh! thank you!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{now i'm perfect.}
<A>__{she looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, almost.}
<A>__{she digs into kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as olaf turns toward her. the carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{woo! head rush!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh! too hard. i'm sorry! i i, i was just.... are you okay?}
<A>__{olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes. he lights up.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{are you kidding me? i am wonderful! i've always wanted a nose.}
<P>__{(going cross eyed to look at his tiny nose)}
<D>__{so cute. it's like a little baby unicorn.}
<A>__{anna reaches behind olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{what? hey! whoa.}
<P>__{(seeing his now big nose)}
<D>__{oh, i love it even more! hah.... all right, let's start this thing over. hi everyone. i'm olaf. and i like warm hugs.}
<A>__{olaf opens his arms wide to anna. that triggers a memory. it takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf?...that's right, olaf.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{...and you are?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh, um...i'm anna.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{and who's the funky looking donkey over there?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's sven.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{uh huh. and who's the reindeer?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...sven.}
<A>__{olaf looks from kristoff to sven, confused.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{oh. they're oh, okay....}
<P>__{(accepting it)}
<D>__{makes things easier for me.}
<A>__{sven tries to bite olaf's nose.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{ha. aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.}
<P>__{(gushes)}
<D>__{i like you, too!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf, did elsa build you?}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<A>__{curious, kristoff takes one of olaf's twig arms off, studies it. it seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{do you know where she is?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(studying the arm)}
<D>__{fascinating...}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{do you think you could show us the way?}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(bending the arm)}
<D>__{how does this work?}
<A>__{olaf's dismembered arm slaps kristoff across the face.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{stop it, sven. trying to focus here.}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{yeah, why?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i will tell you why. we need elsa to bring back summer.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{summer?}
<P>__{(sinking into wistfulness)}
<D>__{oh, i don't know why but i've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{really? i'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{nope. but sometimes i like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.}
