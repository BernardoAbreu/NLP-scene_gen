<L>__{exterior new government building day}
<A>__{a dark november sky hangs like a shroud over the building.}
<C>__{leader }
<D>__{a year, gentlemen.}
<L>__{interior council conference room}
<A>__{the heads of each department are gathered around a table of black granite. peter creedy, sitting back out of the lights, is the new head of the finger.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{i have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing. nothing!}
<A>__{he glares at finch.}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{now adam, there is no one better than finch and you know it.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{yes, mr. dascombe, i do know it. it is that very fact that keeps me awake at night, wondering if perhaps there is a reason that mr. finch has failed.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{i'm saying that perhaps i don't know you as well as i thought i did.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{are you asking for my resignation?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no, i am asking for some goddamn results!}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{it's not finch's fault, adam.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{we've all been looking. the man simply disappeared.}
<C>__{etheridge}
<D>__{vanished.}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{he's gone, adam. it's over.}
<A>__{the leader trembles like a volcano set to blow.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{it's over, is it? he's gone. vanished, you say?}
<A>__{the leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams of computer printout across the table.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive contexterior this is only thirty days!}
<A>__{he punches a "play" button and a wall of monitors blink on. it is a recording of a television variety show. a character that is made to look like adam susan is giving a speech. a woman is dressed like v except that the only thing she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt, stockings and high heels. v sneaks up behind susan and yanks his pants down. susan is outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants. the audience hoots and howls. the leader kills the tape.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{is this what you consider, "disappeared?"}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{for god's sake, adam, it's a stupid variety show.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. creedy, i want the producers, writers, and actors of that "stupid variety show" arrested and charged with sedition.}
<C>__{creedy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{you can't be serious }
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{push me, roger, push me and you'll find out how serious i am.}
<A>__{he stares each of them to silence.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{this, this v is still out there. i can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public. something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake.}
<A>__{he pauses.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{that is why i am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of november you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, i will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions.}
<A>__{everyone is stunned.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. creedy, i will speak with you in private. the rest of you are dismissed. england prevails.}
