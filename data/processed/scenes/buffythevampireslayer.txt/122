<L>__{interior clothing store day}
<A>__{a mod, brightly lit store. a little hipper than your usual mall fare, but not melrose either. bright colors reign. buffy is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her fingernails, talking to merrick as he changes inside.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i mean, most of the time jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'me tarzan'ish, you know what i mean? lately it bugs me, i guess.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{merrick? are you still breathing?}
<C>__{merrick }
<P>__{(from inside)}
<D>__{i can't work this.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{we call them zippers. they're not supposed to be a challenge.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{but it's in the back. why are we wasting time with this, anyway?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{because you clash, merrick. you clash with everything. i mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'slayers trained her.' honestly, you look like something out of... pasadena.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{my clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{well, you're on my turf now. you're just gonna have to trust me.}
<A>__{merrick comes out of the booth. he wears multi colored parachute pants and an equally loud t shirt. buffy looks at him he looks at himself.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i want to die.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(doesn't like it either)}
<D>__{okay. the important thing is not to panic.}
