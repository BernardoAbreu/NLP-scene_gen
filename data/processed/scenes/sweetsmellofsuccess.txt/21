<A>__{sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the phone booths are, camera panning.}
<B>__{phone booths}
<A>__{sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard, instructing her:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{honey, get me mr. hunsecker.}
<A>__{the girl reaches for a book of phone numbers, then remembers:}
<C>__{operator}
<D>__{he's right inside, mr. falco.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(from inside the booth)}
<D>__{so it isn't long distance.}
<A>__{as the girl, shrugging, puts through the call, camera moves closer to sidney in the booth. he hears the connection made, speaks at once.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{j.j.? it's me }
<A>__{we are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a voice on the other end. though the words are not distinguishable, it is quite clear that the speaker is not talking to the phone. sidney seems to relax, as if this is something that happens often. he waits, studying his manicured fingertips... presently sidney hears the voice on the other end become clearer. it asks: "yes?" camera moves closer as sidney says:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{j.j., it's sidney. can you come outside for one minute?}
<A>__{hunsecker's voice, filtered through the sound of the telephone, is sharp and tiny; but the words are now very clear.}
<C>__{hunsecker }
<D>__{can i come out? no.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(tensely)}
<D>__{i have to talk to you, alone, j.j., that's why.}
<C>__{hunsecker }
<D>__{you had something to do for me you didn't do it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{can i come in for a minute?}
<C>__{hunsecker }
<D>__{no. you're dead, son get yourself buried!}
<A>__{there is a click as hunsecker hangs up. sidney, more slowly, also hangs up. brooding, he comes out of the booth.}
