<A>__{choi and trinity look up in the air at the roof of the metacortex building, standing beyond a block of buildings. it sinks toward the ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner.}

<A>__{cu: trinitys face. someone plants the barrel of a silver desert eagle .45 against her temple. trinity whips her head backward as it fires. we drop into bullet time as the flame and concussion blossoms in front of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling a pair of mac 10 uzis from under her jacket.}
<D>__{the mans voice belongs to agent brown}
<A>__{choi turns, pulling a short weapon from under his coat. its boxy, with a short barrel the size of a soda can. he plants it in the small of browns back and pulls the trigger. a cone of fire burns straight through brown, blowing steam, flame, smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach. cu on the weapon. it recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the size of a 12 ounce soda can.}
