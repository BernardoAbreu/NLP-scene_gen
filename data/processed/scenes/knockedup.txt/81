<D>__{alison, i'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how i wanted it. that is why i'm presenting you with this empty box. it's a promise, alison. a promise that one day i will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. i can't afford it yet. i've picked it out, though. it's at de beers and it's really nice. so, basically, i'm asking you, will you marry me? because i'm in love with you.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{really? that's so nice to hear. that's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{but here's the thing. knocked up 73.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there's a thing?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i don't really know yet what that love means. it's so new and it's so exciting. it's great. i don't know. we've only known each other for seventeen weeks.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look, i thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. i'm going to get off my knee. it hurts.}
<A>__{ben sits next to alison on the bed.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i'm okay with that. we're just doing what we can. i don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that makes sense.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i didn't hurt your feelings, did i?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. i just wanted to do right by you. if you don't want to, that's totally cool.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i really do love you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know. thanks. you mentioned that. it's nice.}
