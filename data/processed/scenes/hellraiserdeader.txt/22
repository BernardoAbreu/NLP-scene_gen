<L>__{interior marla's room day}
<A>__{amy steps in and stops, struggling to keep herself from retching. no sign of anything dead. no sound except the sinister buzzing of flies. amy steps cautiously in. she looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double sliding door. she slides open one side, sees nothing that shouldn't be there a ragged winter jacket, a green plastic raincoat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some other garments still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic. she hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open. more of the same. she turns in the other direction. there's a little kitchen. nothing dead there. she starts forward then turns back staring at the refrigerator. she goes quickly over and tugs it open. it's empty. not so much as a ketchup bottle. curious, she opens the freezer. the same. empty. she heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor leading to another bedroom. at the end of the hallway is a bathroom. the door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on the far wall, faces the door. marla is there. dressed only in bra and panties, she is sitting on the closed lid of the john, leaning forward in what seems, at first, to be an impossible angle. her hands hang forward, almost touching the floor. her head is cocked back, staring up. her skin is gray, swollen. amy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. as she approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of the body. a long boot lace has been tied around marla's neck and tied to the wall pipe on the toilet. the flesh of her neck has swollen out, almost burying the boot lace. she has hanged herself in this ghastly way. amy takes another step forward. as she does, there's a sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on marla abruptly rise up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach. but they soon return to the corpse, crawling about the face, around the edges of the glazed, eyes, around the margins of the open mouth, rimmed with dry foam around the out thrust tongue. amy covers her mouth with her shirt, trying to filter out the stench. she backs away from the body and into another room.}
<B>__{in the bedroom}
<A>__{amy starts to search fast, thorough, she's done this sort of thing before. she finds a journal, opens it... no writing. she tosses it aside. pulls open a drawer. she tugs out what looks like a blade less knife handle. she presses a stud. a stiletto blade springs out. she tosses it back in the drawer, tugs some other stuff into view. some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. she goes drawer to drawer, looking for anything that might mean something. socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short skirts and jeans. amy stops, surveying the territory. where to look next? then, deciding, she goes to the bed. she reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a dust encrusted skirt. feels around some more, hesitates, pulls something else out. she brings it out into view. it's a desiccated mouse. she grimaces and tosses it back under the bed in disgust. she stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and the box spring. she feels around, then stops, finding something. she pulls out a little red paper folder the kind that photographs come from. she opens it. it appears to be a photographic record of another "deader" party. we see some of the same participants we also see marla herself in some of the pictures. she's smiling. amy flips the next photograph. it shows marla next to winter. he's holding something in his hand. amy looks closer. the puzzle box amy turns another photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front of marla. the picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose on one end. marla is on the other side almost a kind of "joke" photo. she has a kind of sickly smile on her face. amy's eyes narrow. she holds the picture closer. there seems to be a figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more reality merges with the grains of the photo. what is there? a man? amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room. she stuffs the book in her satchel. amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the unseen bathroom. she sits, silent, waiting. then the sound of the scratching comes again. the sound of flies rising and again, more distinct something scratching. she keeps her position, still listening. nothing. just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing. she moves toward the bathroom. and again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of sound, as if something has disturbed the flies. the sound stops. the flies are still except for the occasional buzz. she advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of marla's hanging, out thrust hands, the tip of one finger just touching the floor. marla's long fingernails are painted green.}
<B>__{the bathroom}
<A>__{she comes around the edge of the bathroom door. marla is motionless. she leans from the pipe by the shoelace. the shoelace is still buried in her throat. the flies buzz up again. the glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets. one of her hands is not visible from amy's position.. we see scratches on the floor beneath her fingernails. amy steels herself and then walks closer. on the corner of the sink, there's a thick manila envelope with something bulky inside something that looks just like a cassette tape. there's a name written on it, and the marker is right next to it. it reads "amy" amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the envelope, horribly close to the body in doing so. she enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink. she is about six inches shy of grabbing it. she notices that her hip is almost touching marla's face as she leans. the flies stir. the stench rises. she stretches closer, and marla's body is pushed aside a few inches. closer and closer amy reaches. her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope. she pitches it and pulls it toward her. it falls off the sink and onto the floor behind marla. now, amy must kneel, and reach past marla face. she holds her breath as she reaches long and far... she manages to grab the envelope, but her face is almost cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse. as she pulls the envelope up, she notices something else in marla's hidden hand.}
<B>__{the puzzle box.}
<A>__{amy reaches over and pries open marla's hand. her blackened fingers snap as they are pulled off the box. amy grabs the box and envelope, stuffs them into her bag, and stands. as she stands next to marla's body suddenly marla's hand grabs amy's leg! amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away, falling backward onto the floor as she does. she rolls over and, in a half crawl, half scramble, gets herself back up to her feet. amy backs up against a wall, kicking marla as she kicks the floor. we can't tell if marla is moving from the kicks or if she is somehow alive. either way, its to much for amy. she stops moving. marla's mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid falls to the floor. its almost as if she is trying to speak. amy has seen enough. up she goes as she tears down the hall, through the living room and smack into the manager! which needless to say, scares the shit out of her. he's standing inside the now open door to the apartment.}

<D>__{she's dead...}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{dead...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{dead! she hung herself in the bathroom. call the police.}
<A>__{the manager grabs amy by the arm. he pulls the cigar from his mouth and points it in her direction. amy hears police sirens in the background.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{already did. who are you?}
<P>__{(pointing his cigar at amy's satchel)}
<D>__{what do you have in there?}
<A>__{in a flash amy twists her arm out of his grasp, and slings her knee up into his nuts. he doubles over.}
