<A>__{bobby approaches the police chaplain, hands him a note.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{chaplain? i'd like you to introduce me this way. if you don't mind.}
<A>__{the chaplain looks at the paper, nods. he then walks to the podium. bobby sits as the chaplain begins:}
<C>__{police chaplain}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen: we shall begin today's ceremony with the traditional invocation, moving then to the valedictorian address to be given by...robert grusinsky. son of the late deputy chief albert grusinsky, brother of captain joseph grusinsky.}
<A>__{angle on bobby as his real name is spoken:}
<C>__{police chaplain }
<D>__{you know, as i look at this fine young man seated here, i can't help but think about all the young members of our department. i get filled with such pride.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{men like him are the great future of our force...}
<A>__{as the man speaks, bobby scans the room. he sees rosario, standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. her face is partially obscured. bobby cannot believe the flood of emotion that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon catching a glimpse of her. but just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that it is not her but rather a young woman who bears merely a faint resemblance... joseph interrupts this, leans over:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{i love you, bobby.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(back to reality)}
<D>__{love you too, joe.}
<A>__{police line up on the stage. everyone's seated, bobby and joseph in front. the police band begins to play the drums. bobby straightens up, raises his hand along with the sea of blue in a salute as the flag is carried to the front.}
