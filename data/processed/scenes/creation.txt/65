<L>__{ext .upper hallway. day.}
<A>__{he reaches the top of the stairs. annie is directly below him, slumped, still sobbing at the foot of the stairs. emma has ushered innes to the porch out of sight.}

<C>__{emma}
<D>__{mr innes had to have words with her. it is sorted now.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{words are very well. i am asking what happened to her knees.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mr innes sent me to the corner and made me kneel on rock salt.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(in a rush)}
<D>__{i said there were dinosaurs and he said there wasn't dinosaurs but there were because you saw them.}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{annie. let me talk to your father. he told her to kneel til she repented...}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{repented what?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{the bleeding is due to her own stubborn ness. it is finished now.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{it is by no means finished. where is my coat. its intolerable}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{charles. please.}
<A>__{charles ignores her, forcing his arm into the sleeve of his coat.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{mr innes is a dear friend and neighbor. i beg you at least appraise yourself the facts. she contradicted him repeatedly. the fault was annie's mr innes was quite within his rights.}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(his arm is stuck)}
<D>__{in his rights to torture our children for expressing the plain truth.}
<A>__{brodie appears and darwin ushers annie towards her}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{...please take her to kitchen.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{it is not the truth as he sees it}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{well damn how he sees it. damn the pair of them and all their works}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{charles listen to yourself. listen}
<A>__{blocking his path as he heads for the door. her palm flat on his lapel, soothing, reasoning with him}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{emma please. i will not have innes tell me what i can and cannot tell my children.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{it is what i have told them every night at bedtime. it is the instruction my aunt and your brother and most of our family live by. it is what all of the village believe ...or try to. charles. must our children be revolutionaries at nine years of age. write to him with your concerns our concerns about the manner of the punishment but please do not set yourself against him. think of my feelings on this. i beg you.}
<A>__{finally his outrage has spent itself, neutralized by her gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you're right of course.... i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he embraces her. emma is reassured, she cannot see the conflict written all over darwins face.}
