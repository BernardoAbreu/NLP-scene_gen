<D>__{i'm a khaki scout. it's what i'm trained for.}

<A>__{sam serves the fish onto two tin plates. he says as they eat with folding forks:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs.}
<A>__{sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper. suzy frowns.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that's ok. he only eats cat food.}
<A>__{suzy points to a cardboard box. sam looks inside. it is filled with ten cans of cat food. sam raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what else did you bring? we should make an inventory.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{sam flips open a small, spiral bound note book.}
<C>__{sam}

<A>__{suzy opens the top of her portable record player. she displays it like a salesman.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{this is my record player. it works with batteries. actually, it belongs to my little brother lionel. i left him a note. do you like music?}
<A>__{sam nods and makes a note. suzy opens her leather folder. there are three l.p. records in it. she takes out one by a french singer.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{this is my favorite record album. my godmother gave it to me for my birthday. she lives in france.}
<A>__{sam nods and makes another note. suzy opens her suitcase. it is filled to the brim with hard back copies of fantasy books. it contains no other items of any kind (including clothing).}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{these are my books. i like stories with magic powers in them. either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. also, time travel, if they make it realistic. usually, i prefer a girl hero, but not always. i couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. you can borrow any you want.}
<A>__{sam nods and makes another note. suzy produces a few more}
