<L>__{interior longshanks' bedchamber night}
<A>__{longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption. edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his eyes. the princess enters, and marches to the bedside.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i have come to beg for the life of william wallace.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you fancy him.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i respect him. at worst he was a worthy enemy. show mercy... oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.}
<A>__{longshanks shakes his head.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{even now, you are incapable of mercy?}
<A>__{the king can't speak. but hatred still glows in his eyes. the princess looks at her husband.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{nor you. to you that word is as unfamiliar as love.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead.}
<A>__{she leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. the guards flanking the door start forward but the princess's eyes flare at them with more fire than even longshanks once showed and the guards back off. she leans down and hisses to longshanks, so softly that even edward can't hear...}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{you see? death comes to us all. and it comes to william wallace. but before death comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you. a child who is not of your line grows in my belly. your son will not sit long on the throne. i swear it.}
<A>__{she lets go of the old king. he sags like an empty sack back onto his satin pillows. without even a look at her husband she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the dying king rasping the air like a saw.}
