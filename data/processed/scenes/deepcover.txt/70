<A>__{a 21 year old renegade from the cal tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd. he picks up...}

<A>__{colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels.}
<C>__{cal tech}
<D>__{this is an addictive amphetamine with time space distortion, delusions of grandeur or maybe they're real tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. it's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner.}
<A>__{he tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones.}
<C>__{cal tech}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate like emotional surface. ideal for the post political, post rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. it's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab.}

<D>__{randy's a genius. his professor told him he could win the nobel prize.}
<C>__{cal tech}
<D>__{nobel prizes are for wussies.}

<D>__{what does this shit do to you?}
<C>__{cal tech}
<D>__{i'm on it now. it's like cocaine only better.}
<P>__{(offers him powder on a slide)}

<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i don't take drugs.}

<D>__{your mistake. this is designed for the top end of the market. for people who want to master reality, not avoid it. because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or best of all import it.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{what would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity?}
<C>__{cal tech}
<D>__{with a million dollars, i could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop.}
<P>__{(makes a face: fair)}
<D>__{but then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. you cheat me, randy, i will use your bladder for a bagpipe.}
<P>__{(to hull, with a vengeance)}
<D>__{we're going to put barbosa out of business.}
<A>__{elias is very happy. he leads hull out.}
