<L>__{interior vampire coven bar (london soho) night}
<A>__{no mortals in sight. amongst various vampires, we spy the vampire lover talking to the punk vampire who tried to attack jesse.}
<L>__{exterior vampire bar front door}
<A>__{the vampire doorman opens the door and peers out. a figure moves towards him...}
<B>__{akasha}
<A>__{glowing, beautiful, majestic. the vampire doorman is frightened, but mesmerized as she moves in...}
<L>__{interior vampire bar}
<A>__{the barman looks up at the sound of the door slamming. he does a double take and watches in awe as... akasha steps in. everyone in the bar turns. she smiles at all the undead staring at her.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching, then she hears a vampire lestat video playing. she whirls around quickly to the tv gazes at the video intensely. her eyes narrow, focus on lestat, speaks as if to herself.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{hmmm... his scent is fading. he was here too long ago...}
<A>__{the vampire lover slides up next to her.}
<C>__{vampire lover}
<D>__{you like him, love?}
<C>__{akasha}
<P>__{(still staring at tv)}
<D>__{he reminds me of someone i know.}
<C>__{vampire lover}
<D>__{all he's gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones. we're gonna dismember him. bleed him dry.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{really? is that what you're going to do?}
<A>__{she turns to vampire lover, takes him in. as if with a new idea, smiles at him, moves to the dance floor, moving to lestat's music, her eyes closed, swaying sensually, her hips gyrating. the dance is seductive, slow, her head thrown back. the vampires turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her movements. they move to the dance floor, watching. akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to vampire lover, points to him, beckons. he smiles back, happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. she dances a little farther away. a game. he laughs. moves closer.}
<B>__{close on vampire lover}
<A>__{he hears a laugh.}
<B>__{back to akasha}
<A>__{but she's disappeared. he turns. akasha's behind him now. he stares at her. her hips are gyrating, her body slithering. a moan escapes from him. again, he moves to her, reaches for her. she laughs.}
<B>__{close on his puzzled face}
<A>__{he turns... she's dancing across the floor now. vampire lover's smile is not so friendly now. he steps toward her, determined... she moves behind him. her body pressed up tight against his. he smiles, shudders with a rush of desire. all the other vampires watch, envious. her lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his body pausing on his chest. he reaches for her. she kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. on vampire lover's face, pure pleasure...}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{then again, you could always do this...}
<A>__{akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same time, plunges her hand down. we can't see where... we stay on vampire lover's face as akasha disappears from frame. the sound of bone snapping, the squish of ripping flesh. loud sucking. a look of horror appears on vampire lover's face. akasha reappears. in her hand, she now holds... ... his dripping heart. she brings it to her lips, sucks again thirstily... vampire lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry husk, then tosses it. she turns back to vampire lover, his face frozen in a grotesque mask. she laughs, drops him unceremoniously to the floor... akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires. they begin to back away. but the door locks itself}
<B>__{loudly.}
<A>__{akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if refreshed.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{turn up the music!}
<A>__{the terrified barman quickly complies.}
<C>__{akasha}
<P>__{(smiles, to herself)}
<D>__{oh, i do love the 21st century.}
<A>__{akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching for a snack. he flails but is overwhelmed by her strength... the vampire girl who jesse saw vanish with the yuppie, flies towards akasha, knife raised, but akasha just turns... suddenly there is an explosion of flames. the vampire girl screams as she is consumed. the piano player and guitar player go up in flames... all hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the door. the lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as the flames overwhelm them... and through the flames, we see akasha smiling, now sucking on the punk vampire's aorta like it's a straw. she tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her bloody, thirsty lips. she strides out through the flames. in a whispery, sing song voice.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{lesta at... come out, come out wherever you are.}
