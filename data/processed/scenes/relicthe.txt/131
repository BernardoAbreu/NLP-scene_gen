<L>__{interior diorama night}
<A>__{pendergast has the plans open as he studies them. he speaks into the walkie talkie. margo paces behind him, thinking hard.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{we're fine. take the left fork behind you. you'll be in a straight passage. when the hall forks again in fifty yards go right. then radio back.}
<L>__{interior sub basement night}
<A>__{d'agosta shuts off his walkie talkie. everyone's staring at him.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{all right. kawakita, cover the rear.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, lieutenant. he's not a good enough shot. i will do it if you take care of my daughter.}
<A>__{d'agosta nods. frank expertly reloads. d'agosta holsters the walkie talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage. kawakita takes charge of lauren, who is confused and terrified. the tunnel has a slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at everyone's legs. people slip and slide as they half make their way down the hill. d'agosta calls behind them.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{damn. it's getting deep. see anything?}
<A>__{on frank... back not far from the first fork. he looks towards the head of the tunnel, calls out...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you'll be the first to know.}
<A>__{frank turns and plunges after the others. but then suddenly, he stops. on d'agosta... he reaches the second fork and takes a right. this tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper. slimy plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on. d'agosta pulls out his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{pendergast? i made the right hand fork. we're already in about three feet of water. where should we go?}
<A>__{but before pendergast can answer, d'agosta hears the loud report of frank's gun! everyone freezes in the darkness. the walkie talkie cackles and d'agosta shouts!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{hello!}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{sweet jesus, help!}
<A>__{they hear splashing in the water. lauren screams, tries to run back. kawakita grabs her. there's more thrashing water and then silence.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{frank! are you all right!}
<A>__{d'agosta starts for frank but the mayor catches his arm and holds him.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{it's too late!}
<A>__{everyone waits, staring into the darkness. still no answer. lauren}
<B>__{screams again.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{d'agosta turns his flashlight on the water. it's running red! he spins to the mayor, points down the tunnel.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{people start to cry and whimper as the mayor urges them on. he takes charge of lauren. only greg kawakita stays with d'agosta. they stand shoulder to shoulder and completely alone. thrashing in the water can be heard as the beast comes closer. there's a low, pleasurable growl! both men lift their guns.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{on three.}
<A>__{kawakita nods. behind them in the tunnel is total blackness. ahead is equally dark. the noise of their friends gets ever fainter. the water now rushes half way up their thighs. kawakita's teeth start to chatter. he bites them shut, steadies his gun.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{one... two...}
<A>__{silence as the water murmurs. d'agosta holds the count. a long, agonizing moment. kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{i think it's gone.}
<A>__{suddenly a huge claw snakes out of the water right in front of them and the beast roars up! it was beneath the surface, directly before them! the claw closes on d'agosta and his shot gun goes off. d'agosta screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth! for one horrible moment, kawakita is frozen. then he leaps forward, shoves the barrel of his gun behind d'agosta, right in the beast's open jaws! he pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water. with a roar of pain the monster drops d'agosta and retreats in the dark. d'agosta grabs kawakita.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i think you took its tonsils out!}
<A>__{they haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go. ahead is another fork. the group is waiting. when they see d'agosta and kawakita, a cheer goes up.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{which way!}
<A>__{as he runs up, d'agosta grabs for his walkie talkie. the holster is empty, the walkie talkie gone! without missing a beat he registers what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath. he points to the right as if there's no doubt and says...}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{this way!}
<A>__{d'agosta exchanges a look with kawakita, who understands exactly what happened. as they plunge into the right tunnel, greg mutters...}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{holy shit.}
