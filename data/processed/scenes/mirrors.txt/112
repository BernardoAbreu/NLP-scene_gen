<A>__{the nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard. a deadly silence prevails over the monastery, where time seems to stand still. all these women have taken vows of poverty, obedience and chastity to serve god. on the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road zigzags between the pine trees. ben's car draws nearer. he parks in front of the entrance to the monastery.}
