<L>__{interior frost's sleeping chamber day}
<A>__{we are in a windowless, vault like room dominated by a series of high tech stainless steel sarcophagi. think of a hyperbaric coffin, each unit possessing a small face plate window through which the sleeping subject can be viewed. blade unsheathes his sword. he grabs the lid of the first sarcophagus, heaving upward. with a pneumatic hiss, the lid rises, belching out a cloud of condensation mist. as the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, blade raises his sword, ready to plunge it downward only it's not deacon frost who rests beneath him, it's vanessa, blade's mother!!! although some thirty years have passed since the events of our prologue, vanessa looks exactly the same vibrant, beautiful, full of life. her eyes open.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{jason.}
<A>__{blade gasps, uncomprehending.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{mother ?!}
<A>__{vanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i've missed you so much, jason.}
<P>__{(drawing closer)}
<D>__{you have no idea what i've been through, how much i've wanted to see you }
<A>__{blade falters, his mind reeling. what he's seeing is incomprehensible his mother is dead. yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to him and flashing a mouthful of viper like fangs! she snarls and strikes, brutally raking her claws across blade's face, knocking the sword from his grasp a trio of black clad vampires led by mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all along. they're armed with tasers which they fire en masse blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. he writhes as electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. he labors to lift his head, looking up at vanessa }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{but you died }
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(a hellish smile)}
<D>__{deacon brought me back.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{fight him }
<A>__{as if on cue, frost appears at vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. she leans into him an act of practiced intimacy.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{she can't. she's one of my thralls now. she has about as much free will as a puppet on a string.}
<P>__{(looking at vanessa)}
<D>__{you love me, don't you, vanessa?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{frost kisses vanessa hungrily. then he kneels and reaches into blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of blade's serum.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{what do we have here? your precious serum? i don't think you'll be needing this anymore.}
<A>__{frost crushes the vial in his fist. blade struggles to reach frost, stretching a palsied hand upwards }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{please }
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{listen to your father, jason. it's going to be a better world.}
<A>__{blade stares at vanessa uncomprehending.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{don't look so surprised, blade. you've spent your life looking for the vampire who fathered you. well you can rest easy now, you've found him.}
<P>__{(gripping blade's chin)}
<D>__{daddy's here.}
<A>__{blade's eyes widen in shock. frost simply laughs.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{it's true, blade. you've got my blood running through your veins.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{thirty years ago. a moonlit street, a woman on her way home alone. you were conceived the night i tore my fangs into your mother's flesh.}
<A>__{frost swings his fist into blade's skull. everything goes black.}
