<A>__{ichabod faces two massive, vine covered pillars, unsure. he turns to watch the driver lead the coach away. ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road. he does not notice, above: three dead ravens hang from a tree limb, twine wrapped round their necks.}

<A>__{ichabod walks on with baggage. the square is empty, a church and graveyard at one end. the road ahead is bordered by businesses and homes. conversation drifts from a tavern. a criminal sits in stocks. a quiet crying is heard. ichabod hears... he looks for its source. it's from a window above, louder. sounds like the sobbing of an old woman.}
