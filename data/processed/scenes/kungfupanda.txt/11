<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined with palace geese.}
<L>__{interior scroll room day}
<A>__{candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. the door bursts open, the candles flicker. shifu enters.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{master oogway? you summoned me.}
<A>__{he bows. then looks up without unbowing.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<A>__{reveal master oogway... a wise, old tortoise.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{so... nothing's wrong?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{well, i didn't say that.}
<A>__{shifu looks up, concerned. oogway opens his mouth... and blows out a candle. and another candle. and another. finally, shifu uses his kung fu to blow them all out. oogway smiles knowingly.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you were saying?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i have had a vision... tai lung will return.}
<A>__{shifu looks stricken. flashback interior scroll room quick, impressionistic images of shifu battling a large, shadowy figure (tai lung). present interior scroll room shifu is rattled. he looks at the claw marks that still scar the wall and quickly looks away. but he regains his composure.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{that is impossible. he is in prison.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{nothing is impossible.}
<A>__{shifu makes a split decision.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{zeng!}
<A>__{he comes flying in. shifu gets in his face.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{fly to chogun prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. double everything! tai lung does not leave that prison!}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{yes, master shifu.}
<A>__{the goose flies off, but... smack! he hits a column. then he is off. back on oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from shifu.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{we have to do something. we can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! he'll, he'll }
<A>__{oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{your mind is like this water, my friend. when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. but if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.}
<A>__{shifu and oogway stare into the pool. oogway settles the water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a scroll in its mouth.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{the dragon scroll...}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{it is time.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but who? who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? to become...the dragon warrior?!}
<A>__{dramatic music as we push in on oogway's face. then...}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i don't know.}
