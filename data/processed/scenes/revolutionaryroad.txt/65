<L>__{exterior countryside day.}
<A>__{frank, april and john walk through the woods. the ground is freshly rained on and damp. the sun is bright. john buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down over his hands.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i hear you're a mathematician.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you hear wrong. it's all gone now.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{all gone?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you know what electrical shock treatments are?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. yes i do.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i've had thirty seven.}
<A>__{he pushes his hat back and turns his head at april.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{see?}
<A>__{there are scars on his forehead. april can see them.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{supposed to jolt out the `emotional problems.' just jolted out the mathematics.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{how awful.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(mimicking)}
<D>__{`how awful...' why, because mathematics is so `interesting?'}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. because the shocks must be awful and... well, because it's awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do. i think mathematics are dull.}
<A>__{john stares at april. he smiles.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i like your girl, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're not running.}
<A>__{john comes to a stop.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and what's in paris?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{a different way of life.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so maybe we are running... we're running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the hopeless emptiness? now, you've said it. plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... wow.}
<A>__{john continues walking. frank and april watch him go.}
