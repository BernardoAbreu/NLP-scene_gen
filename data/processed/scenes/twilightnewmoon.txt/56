<L>__{exterior la push cliffs (continuous) day}
<A>__{ bella runs toward them. but jacob's laughter slows her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're not really fighting, bella. they're cliff diving.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what, on purpose?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{scary as hell, but a total rush.}
<A>__{bella's pov a diver (paul) takes a running start and flings himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down. bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline for edward.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{most of us jump from lower down.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{think i could?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you said it was a rush.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{maybe on a warmer day. and not from the top. we'll leave the showing off to sam and his disciples.}
<A>__{there's that bitter edge again. she looks at him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you don't like them.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they think they run this place. acting all bad ass, calling themselves "protectors."}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what are they protecting?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him.}
<A>__{bella looks closer, sees the fourth guy is embry, hair now shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. it pains jacob to see him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's embry? i didn't recognize him. what happened to him?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he missed some school then, out of nowhere, he's following sam around. same thing happened with paul and jared. they weren't even friends, now sam owns them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{maybe you should just avoid them.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i try but...}
<A>__{she sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{hey. if it gets worse, we'll go to my dad. or you can come stay with us.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(beat, holding her)}
<D>__{if this is how you're going to react, i will freak out more often.}
<A>__{bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully shoving him. as they head to the truck, bella looks back bella's pov on sam but now he's looking directly at her. then he turns and dives over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.}
