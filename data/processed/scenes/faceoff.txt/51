<L>__{interior erewhon prison delousing cubicle}
<A>__{archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him. a guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate. archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his face. the spray stops when head guard "red" walton enters.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you are now an erewhon inmate a citizen of nowhere. human rights zealots, the geneva convention and the p.c. police have no authority here. you have no right...}
<P>__{(slaps on latex gloves)}
<D>__{when i say your ass belongs to me i mean it. bend over.}
<A>__{archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over and exposes all to the cavity searching guard. satisfied, walton lets archer dress. another guard places a pair of odd looking steel boots before archer.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{step into them.}
<A>__{archer inspects the lock down boots. hinged steel collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle. the soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{don't sniff 'em, you perv. just step into them.}
<A>__{archer obeys. a guard squats down and locks the steel collars over archer's shoes. he tries to move but can't.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{they're too tight.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{so's a noose. now keep your mouth shut.}
<A>__{walton jolts archer with his high voltage shock stick.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{the prison's one big magnetic field. the boots'll tell us where you are every second of the day.}
<P>__{(into comm link)}
<D>__{201 to population.}
<A>__{walton presses his thumb into a standard fbi scan pad. it forms a print positively identifying the guard. the heavy blast door automatically opens.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{i've got fifty bucks says you're dead by dinner. don't disappoint me.}
<A>__{walton prods archer toward the door. to archer's surprise he can now move.}
