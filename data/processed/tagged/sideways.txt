<D>__{what subject is your book? non fiction?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, it's a novel. fiction. although there's a lot from my own life, so i guess technically some of it is non fiction.}
<C>__{mr. erganian}
<D>__{good, i like non fiction. there is so much to know about the world that i think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{so which one do you like better?}

<D>__{why did you tell them my book was being published?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you said you had it all lined up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, i didn't. what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, conundrum.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. she was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... it's always like this. it's always a fucking waiting game. i've been through it too many times already.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. senior editor? sounds like you're in to me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's a long shot, all right? and conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. i'm not getting my hopes up. i've stopped caring. that's it. i've stopped caring.}

<C>__{jack}

<D>__{here's to a great week.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{100% pinot noir. single vineyard. they don't even make it anymore.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jesus. don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. they'll think you're a moron.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just tell me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{color in the red wines comes from the skins. this juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.}

<D>__{oh, yeah. yeah.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i liked it a lot. a lot of improvements. it just seemed overall, i don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{how about the new ending? did you like that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh yeah. much better.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{there is no new ending. page 750 on is exactly the same.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.}

<D>__{so what's up?}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{just seeing how you're doing. and, um, mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?}
<A>__{jack looks at miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{so what do you think? with the feldmans?}
<A>__{jack hasn't even really heard the question.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. the feldmans.}
<A>__{as the conversation continues, miles replaces the gas pump, screws the gas cap back on, and together the guys get back into the car. we drive away with them.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{really? because i don't know, i was thinking that }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, then put him at the singles table.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{the problem with that is that then there's one extra }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then put him with the feldmans. whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{don't dismiss me. i'm trying to include you in this decision. he's your friend.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i didn't dismiss you. i told you what i thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. besides, this is supposed to be my time with miles. i hope you're not going to call every five minutes.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{i'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{honey, i'm just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding. isn't that the point of this? isn't that what we talked about with dr. gertler?}
<A>__{a silence. then }
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{why are you being so defensive?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know, christine. perhaps it's because i feel attacked.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{i ask you one simple question, and suddenly i'm attacking you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen. i will call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?}

<D>__{speak for yourself. i get chicks looking at me all the time. all ages.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's not worth it. you pay too big a price. it's never free.}
<A>__{they eat in silence a moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need to get laid.}
<A>__{miles shrugs off the comment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it'd be the best thing for you. you know what? i'm going to get you laid this week. that's going to be my best man gift to you. i'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'd rather have a knife.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. no. you've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. now it's worse you're wasting away. teaching english to fucking eighth graders when they should be reading what you wrote. your books.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm working on it.}
<A>__{miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you still seeing that shrink?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i went on monday. but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, xanax?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and lexapro, yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i say fuck that. you need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jack. this week is not about me. it's about you. i'm going to show you a good time. we're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and get your bone smooched.}
<A>__{jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee. she nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over. jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait. jack turns back to see miles watching him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<L>__{exterior central coast day}
<A>__{in a series of shots, the saab now with its top down makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the santa barbara area might recognize. music accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip.}
<L>__{interior exterior saab day}
<A>__{the car now descends the santa ynez mountains and heads toward buellton. miles and jack must shout to be heard in the open car.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you know what? let's take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whatever's closest, man. i need a glass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{these guys make top notch pinot and chardonnay. one of the best producers in santa barbara county.}
<P>__{(looking out the window)}
<D>__{look how beautiful this view is. what a day!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i thought you hated chardonnay.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i like all varietals. i just don't generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.}
<L>__{exterior santa rosa turn off day}
<A>__{the saab passes over the 101 and turns onto santa rosa road.}
<L>__{interior exterior saab day}
<A>__{the boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jesus, what a day! isn't it gorgeous? and the ocean's just right over that ridge. see, the reason this region's great for pinot is that the cold air off the pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries. pinot's a very thin skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity.}
<A>__{jack looks at miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness. the saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel driveway.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, miles. i really hope your novel sells.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{thanks, jack. so do i.}
<P>__{(noticing)}
<D>__{here we are.}
<L>__{exterior sanford tasting room day}
<A>__{miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. as they get out and walk }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you. filet and salmon.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, but how are they making the salmon? poached with a yogurt dill sauce? teriyaki? curry?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. salmon. don't you always have white wine with fish?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, jesus. look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taking out his phone)}
<D>__{let me call christine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{doesn't have to be now. let's go taste.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i owe her a call anyway.}
<A>__{miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as jack speed dials.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, honey. so we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon.}
<A>__{jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, i know, i didn't forget, but we wound up at miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so i'm calling you now. i said i was sorry. yes, i did.}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you heard me say i was sorry, right?}
<A>__{miles just shrugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles heard me say i was sorry.}
<A>__{as jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{give me a break, will you? i just called to find out about the salmon for our wedding to be more involved, like you said and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i didn't call. you're totally right. i know, but i'm trying to make this the best wedding i can with the best wine we can find. don't i get any credit for that? okay. look, i've got to go. i'm out here in the parking lot, and miles is waiting for me...}
<A>__{and so it goes, jack's voice rising and falling. miles decides to head inside.}
<L>__{interior sanford tasting room day}
<A>__{miles is at the bar, two glasses in front of him. jack walks in and bellies up next to him.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{baked with a butter lime glaze.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now we're talking.}
<A>__{chris burroughs, a pourer in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{this is the condemned man?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{here he is. jack, chris. chris, jack.}
<A>__{chris and jack shake hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you guys want to start with the vin gris?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<A>__{two glasses are filled with small amounts of pinot noir vin}
<B>__{gris.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is rose, right?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{good, yeah, it is a rose. only this one is rather atypically made from 100% pinot noir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pinot noir? not again!}
<P>__{(joking, to chris)}
<D>__{you know, not all pinots are noir.}
<A>__{they laugh. miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell. jack clumsily imitates miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let me show you.}
<A>__{we see details of what miles now describes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{first take your glass and examine the wine against the light. you're looking at color and clarity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what color is it supposed to be?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{depends on the varietal. just get a sense of it. thick? thin? watery? syrupy? inky? amber, whatever...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now tip it. what you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. this is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. now stick your nose in it.}
<A>__{jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't be shy. get your nose in there.}
<A>__{jack now buries his nose in the glass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what do you smell?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. wine? fermented grapes?}
<A>__{miles smells.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{there's not much there yet, but you can still find...}
<P>__{(more sniffs)}
<D>__{...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty edam cheese.}
<A>__{jack smells again and begins to brighten.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh. maybe a little strawberry. yeah, strawberry. i'm not so sure about the cheese.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now set your glass down and get some air into it.}
<A>__{miles expertly swirls the wine. jack follows suit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors. very important. now we smell again.}
<A>__{they do so. jack smiles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's what you do with every one.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{when do we get to drink it?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{jack gulps his wine down in one shot. miles chews his before swallowing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how would you rate this one?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.}
<P>__{(to chris)}
<D>__{this is the new one, right, chris?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{released it about two months ago.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nice job.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{we like it.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you know, you could work in a wine store.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, that would be a good move.}
<A>__{now miles notices something about jack.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{are you chewing gum?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{want some?}

<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{miles and jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds. later the sounds of a shower and off key singing come from the bathroom while miles sits impatiently on the bed. he pounds on the wall.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hey jack, hurry up!}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{just a minute!}
<A>__{opening the bedside drawer, miles finds a gideon's bible and tosses it in the trash apparently his hotel routine.}
<L>__{exterior highway 246 dusk}
<A>__{freshly showered and dressed for dinner, miles and jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two lane highway. they pass a mall and a car dealership.}

<D>__{i thought you said it was close. now i'm all pitted out.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's not even a mile.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we should have driven.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not with the wine list these people have. we don't want to hold back.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you think i'm making a mistake marrying christine?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{whoa.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, do you think i'm doing the right thing? tell the truth. you've been through it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to christine for some good reason. so i think it's great. it's time. you've got to have your eyes open, that's all. i mean, look at me. i thought victoria and i were set for life.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{christine's dad he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. showing me the ropes. and that's something, considering how long it took him to get over i'm not armenian. so i'm thinking about it. but i don't know, might get a little incestuous. but mike does pretty well. a lot of high end commercial stuff.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so you're going to stop acting?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no way. this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying. i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're not getting any younger, right? and my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. even with my new manager. maybe it's time to settle down.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{if that's what feels right.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(convincing himself)}
<D>__{it does. feels right.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{then it's a good thing.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(nodding, feeling better)}
<D>__{yeah. it's good. feels good.}

<D>__{gary.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{when's that novel of yours coming out? we all want to read it.}
<C>__{miles}

<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{they have their own label that's just outstanding.}
<A>__{gary pours jack and miles a generous sample and the two men swirl, sniff and taste. jack is beginning to get the hang of things.}

<L>__{interior hitching post dining room night}
<A>__{jack and miles review their menus. jack looks up and spots a pretty waitress placing an order at the bar.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles. check it out.}
<A>__{miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, yeah. that's maya.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know her?}
<C>__{miles}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and very nice. and very married. check out the rock.}
<A>__{jack leans forward and squints.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{doesn't mean shit. when christine was a hostess at sushi roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. think it worked? fuck no. how do you think i met her?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{this gal's married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she works for tips!}
<C>__{jack}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{how about this?}

<D>__{nope. i don't think we know each other well enough.}
<P>__{(picking out another bottle)}
<D>__{i'd say this guy's more our speed.}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so what gems do you have in your collection?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not much of a collection really. i haven't had the wallet for that, so i sort of live bottle to bottle. but i've got a couple things i'm saving. i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{you've got a '61 cheval blanc that's just sitting there? go get it.}
<P>__{(pushing him, playfully stern)}
<D>__{right now. hurry up...}
<A>__{miles laughs, fights back a bit.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? at least that's what i've read.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{it might be too late already. what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. special occasion. with the right person. it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{the day you open a '61 cheval blanc, that's the special occasion.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{how long have you been into wine?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i started to get serious about seven years ago.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what was the bottle that did it?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{eighty eight sassicaia.}
<A>__{miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. maya pours, and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{wow. we gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. really good. how about you?}
<C>__{maya}
<P>__{(tastes again)}
<D>__{i think they overdid it a bit. too much alcohol. overwhelms the fruit.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(tasting again, impressed)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd say you're right on the money.}
<A>__{then miles absently scans the refrigerator door and spots a photo of stephanie holding a little girl.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is this stephanie's kid? sure is cute.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, siena's a sweetie.}
<C>__{miles}

<D>__{who me? nah, i'd just fuck them up. that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, same here.}
<A>__{maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, thinking about something else.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{let's go in there.}
<A>__{maya takes the bottle, and they wander into }
<L>__{interior stephanie's living room continuous}
<A>__{jack and stephanie are gone. from a distant bedroom comes more laughter.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{looks like our friends are hitting it off.}
<A>__{while maya goes to turn down the stereo, miles sits on the couch. maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving miles a glimpse of the small of her back. she takes a seat opposite miles on the couch. they look at each other without speaking. just what is the vibe here?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{it's kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie's house. all those times you came into the restaurant. it's like you're a real person now. almost.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, i know. it's kind of weird. out of contexterior}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, weird. but great.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah. definitely.}
<A>__{an awkward silence, broken by maya.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so what's your novel about?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, it's a little difficult to summarize. it begins as a first person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{what's the title?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{"the day after yesterday."}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh. you mean... today?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{um... yeah but it's more...}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mrnmm, yeah... but not really. it shifts around a lot. like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. and some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbe grillet mystery you know, with no real resolution.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{wow. anyway, i think it's amazing you're getting it published. really. i know how hard it is. just to write it even.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(squeezing it out)}
<D>__{yeah. thanks.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{like me, i have this stupid paper due on friday, and as usual i'm freaked out about it. just like in high school. it never changes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{a paper?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah. i'm working on a masters in horticulture. chipping away at it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{horticulture? wow. i didn't know there was a college here.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i commute to san luis obispo twice a week.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so... you want to work for a winery or something someday?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. it's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh yeah. who cares? i'm the queen of typos.}
<P>__{(sipping the wine)}
<D>__{wow, this is really starting to open up. what do you think?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{my palate's kind of shot, but from what i can tell, i'd dub it pretty damn good.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{can i ask you a personal question?}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(bracing himself)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{why are you so into pinot? it's like a thing with you.}
<A>__{miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. he searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. it's a hard grape to grow. as you know. it's thin skinned, temperamental, ripens early. it's not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked away corners of the world. and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. and when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.}
<A>__{maya has found this answer revealing and moving.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i mean, cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. by comparison. how about you?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. why are you into wine?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i suppose i got really into wine originally through my ex husband. he had a big, kind of show off cellar. but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate, and the more i drank, the more i liked what it made me think about.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah? like what?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{like what a fraud he was.}
<A>__{miles laughs.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{no, but i do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. i love how wine continues to evolve, how every time i open a bottle it's going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day. because a bottle of wine is actually alive it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. that is, until it peaks like your '61 and begins its steady, inevitable decline. and it tastes so fucking good.}
<A>__{now it is miles's turn to be swept away. maya's face tells us the moment is right, but miles remains frozen. he needs another sign, and maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(pointing)}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah.}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i was just getting some water. you want some water?}
<A>__{miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone. he kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward. after a few seconds, maya breaks away.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{but instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{i should probably get going.}

<D>__{wow. great.}
<A>__{he turns around again, produces a second box, and hands it over as well.}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{could i get a glass please?}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{stephanie took me out into the pinot fields today. it was awesome. i think i finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the what do you call it? selection and harvest. and the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it. we even ate pinot grapes right off the vine.}
<P>__{(the new expert)}
<D>__{still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure. stephanie really knows her shit, miles.}
<A>__{jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.}

<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{with this chick.}
<A>__{jack just looks at him.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{does she know about saturday?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{um... not exactly. but i've been honest. i haven't told her i'm available. and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. besides...}
<A>__{jack stops short in a rare instance of self censorship.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{besides what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well... i don't know, just... the wedding.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i've been doing some thinking.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, you've been thinking. and?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i may have to put the wedding on hold is all.}
<A>__{miles looks at him with incredulity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, miles. i've got to be sure i'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. and not just for my sake. i'm thinking about christine's feelings too. i take marriage very seriously always have. that's why i've never done it before. the day i get married, it's going to be the real thing.}
<A>__{miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{being with stephanie has opened my eyes. she's not uptight or controlling. she's just cool. things are so easy with her. smells different. tastes different. fucks different. fucks like an animal. i'm telling you, i went deep last night, miles. deep.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{deep.}
<A>__{miles draws a long sigh.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't get all judgmental on me. this is my deal. it's my life, and it's my call.}
<A>__{they fall silent for a moment. then }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was hoping to get some understanding from you. and i'm not getting it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{understanding of what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{like i might be in love with another woman.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{in love? twenty four hours with some wine pourer chick and you think you're in love? and give up everything?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look who's talking. you've been there.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yes i have, and do i look like a happy man? was all that drama with brenda a happy thing for me to do? huh? was it? is she a part of my life now?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is totally different. i'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. that's the distinction. i have not made the commitment yet. i am not married. i have not said the words. in a few days, i might get married, and if i do, then i won't be doing stuff like this anymore. otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and what about stephanie? she's a woman with a kid. a single mom. what do you think she's looking for? huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{here's what i'm thinking. we move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. you design your own wine; i will handle the business side. then you get inspired and write a new novel. as for me, if an audition comes along, hell, la's two hours away. not even.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're crazy. you've gone crazy.}

<D>__{that was three years ago after that first party!}

<P>__{(his hand on his chest)}
<D>__{my intuition that's all i have. and you're asking me to go against it. and that's just wrong.}
<A>__{just then stephanie walks in. she cozies up to jack, and he kisses the top of her head.}

<C>__{maya}
<D>__{could i have my paper, please?}
<A>__{unsure what she wants at first, miles reaches into the back seat for the new york times. he hands it to her and watches until she goes inside.}

<A>__{miles pulls up and parks.}
<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{as miles enters, a shirtless jack drops the barely legal and is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big bearhug. the tv is on, perhaps showing an e! true hollywood story.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{put me down, jack.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i said put me down. jack!}
<A>__{still gripping miles in a bearhug, jack flings the both of them onto the bed. now on top of miles, jack kisses both cheeks.}

<D>__{i'm so proud of you! let me love you!}
<A>__{now they get up off the bed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so tell me everything. details. i like details.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's private.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're kidding, right? tell me what happened, you fucker, or i will tie your dick in a knot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let's leave it alone.}
<A>__{jack looks at miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you didn't get any, did you?}
<P>__{(off miles's silence)}
<D>__{you're a homo.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{just stop, okay? make something up, and that's what happened. whatever you want. write my confession, and i will sign it. just stop pushing me all the time! i can't take it! you're an infant! this is all a big party for you, but not for me! this is serious. and you just... leave me alone, okay? you're fucking me up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wow. okay. calm down. sorry.}
<A>__{miles begins to calm down. jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did you have trouble performing? yeah, that's...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{shut up! shut up, jack!}
<A>__{the phone rings and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't answer it.}
<A>__{but jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of russian roulette.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm telling you, don't.}
<A>__{jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hello? oh, hey, honey. how you doing? uh huh. uh huh.}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{christine.}
<A>__{miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. his face is dark with resentment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen, honey. let me call you back. miles and i are in the middle of something. no, it's nothing serious miles is just having one of his freak outs. yeah. love you too. i will call you right back.}
<A>__{jack hangs up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{this whole week has gone sour. it isn't turning out like it was supposed to.}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{i want to go home.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's being selfish now? i'm the one getting married. i thought this week was supposed to be about me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{we gotta slow down.}
<P>__{(closing his eyes)}
<D>__{i'm so tired. let's just get out of here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know what you need.}
<L>__{interior sears day}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{do you like them?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, they're great. sporty. they're really sporty.}
<C>__{miles}

<D>__{feel better?}
<A>__{miles shrugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(noticing something)}
<D>__{oh here, wait a second. i want to run in here real quick.}
<A>__{he heads toward a toys store.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{i want to get something for siena.}

<L>__{interior exterior saab day}
<A>__{miles is slumped in the passenger seat as jack drives. they pass a big commercial winery. jack slows down, preparing to turn in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how about this one? we didn't hit this one.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, it's frass canyon. it's a joke.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you ever actually been in there, miles?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't have to.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(turning the wheel)}
<D>__{i say we check it out. you never know.}
<L>__{exterior large winery parking lot day}
<A>__{the saab finds a place in the large parking lot. a tour bus, whose flank reads "solvang wine tours," is in the process of letting out wine tourists, many of them elderly.}
<L>__{interior large winery day}
<A>__{the room boasts not only a large tasting bar but also display after display of t shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo. in the corner an acoustic guitarist with a small amp plays soothing windham hill ish music. the tasting bar is packed three deep with tasters attended to by harried pourers. finally the pourer gets to their glasses. miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus. probably didn't de stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. fucking raid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. tastes okay to me.}
<P>__{(looking at the tasting sheet)}
<D>__{hey, they got a reserve pinot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let me use your phone.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(handing it over)}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i can't take it anymore. i've got to call evelyn.}
<L>__{exterior large winery day}
<A>__{walking across the lawn outside, miles holds the cellphone to his ear.}

<D>__{evelyn berman silverman's office.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi, it's miles.}
<C>__{assistant }
<D>__{oh, hi, miles. let me see if i can get her.}
<P>__{(a moment later)}
<D>__{you're in luck. i will put you through.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hey, evelyn, it's your favorite client.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{how's the trip?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{good, good. drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. so what's happening? still no word?}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{actually there is word. i spoke to keith kurtzman this morning.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{and... they're passing. conundrum's passing. he said they really liked it. they really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. he said it was a tough call.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{i'm sorry, miles.}
<P>__{(off his silence)}
<D>__{so i don't know where that leaves us. i'm not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it. i think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now a fabulous book with no home. the whole industry's gotten gutless. it's not about the quality of the books. it's about the marketing.}
<A>__{miles is at a loss for words. a distant rumble begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.}
<L>__{exterior deep canyon insert}
<A>__{once again we see the narrow rope bridge extending vertiginously across a great chasm.}
<L>__{exterior large winery back again}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{are you there? miles?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, i'm here.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{i'm sorry, miles. we did all we could. you've been a real trooper.}
<P>__{(loudly, to her assistant)}
<D>__{tell him i will call back.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so i guess that's it.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{you're a wonderful writer, miles. don't be discouraged.}
<A>__{moments later miles staggers toward the tasting room, unpocketing his xanax and downing a couple, as evelyn's cliches of consolation continue in his head.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{just hang in there, and who knows? after you get something else published, we can revisit this one. and next time we can try a different title.}
<A>__{once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself. the rumble grows deafening.}
<L>__{interior large winery day}
<A>__{now inside, miles grabs the first dirty wine glass he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station. he pushes his way to front. the pourer offers the usual one ounce dollop. miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hit me again.}
<A>__{the same small amount is poured and downed. once again miles holds out his glass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{pour me a full glass. i will pay for it.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{this is a tasting, sir. not a bar.}
<A>__{miles slams a twenty dollar bill on the table.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{just give me a full goddamn pour.}
<A>__{the pourer turns away to serve another party. miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice. now miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{sir, what are you doing?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i told you i need a drink.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{then buy a bottle and go outside.}
<A>__{the pourer grabs miles by the wrist before he can drink.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{put the glass down.}
<A>__{in the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{you're going to have to leave, sir.}
<A>__{the pourer signals to a security guy at the door. across the room jack notices the disturbance and heads over. miles hoists up the spit bucket, holds it aloft and starts to guzzle it. wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes. the security guy yanks the bucket away from miles, and drags him toward the exit. jack catches up.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the horrified onlookers)}
<D>__{it's all right. his mother just died.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{two pelicans soar low over the water. one of the dives, crashing into the water and disappearing from view. jack and miles sit on the hood of the saab, gazing at the ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just write another one. you have lots of ideas, right?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, i'm finished. i'm not a writer. i'm a middle school english teacher. i'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. it's okay. i like books. the world doesn't give a shit what i have to say. i'm unnecessary.}
<P>__{(a dark laugh)}
<D>__{i'm so insignificant, i can't even kill myself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you know hemingway, sexton, woolf, plath, delmore schwartz. you can't kill yourself before you've even been published.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces? he committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't give up. you're going to make it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{half my life is over, and i have nothing to show for it. i'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. i'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{see? right there. just what you just said. that's beautiful. a thumbprint on a skyscraper. i couldn't write that.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{neither could i. i think it's bukowski.}
<A>__{unable to respond, jack looks up and down the beach.}
<L>__{exterior bucolic road day}
<A>__{zoom! there goes the saab. the camera lingers behind and pans to reveal the dead dog, now covered with flies and maggots.}
<L>__{exterior windmill inn day}
<A>__{jack and miles pull into the parking lot.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(lighting up)}
<D>__{oh, look. there's steph!}
<A>__{he smiles broadly and honks his horn. miles turns to see }
<B>__{stephanie}
<A>__{seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her helmet in her lap, watching patiently as }
<B>__{the saab}
<A>__{pulls to a stop in a parking space. miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his sears bag.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey, baby.}
<A>__{stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a big cuddly lion doll.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look what i got for our favorite girl.}
<A>__{stephanie walks toward jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion. when they get close, stephanie's face transforms with rage.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{you motherfucker!}
<A>__{she swings her helmet and hits jack full in the face. jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. stephanie stands over him and continues to beat him with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion. miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{stephanie! stop!}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{you fucking bastard! lying piece of shit! you're getting married on saturday? what was all that shit you said to me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can explain.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{you said you loved me! you fuck! i hope you die!}
<A>__{with that she backs away. glancing at her bloodied helmet, she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{fuckface!}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you too!}
<A>__{as she speeds away, miles is left to comfort his wounded friend. the lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.}
<L>__{interior exterior saab day}
<A>__{seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, jack presses a blood soaked towel against his face.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't need a lecture. you fucking told maya, didn't you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, i did not. must have been gary at the hitching post. i think we mentioned it to him the first night.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you told him. i'm fucking hurting here.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{keep it elevated.}
<L>__{interior hospital er waiting room day}
<A>__{close on a cosmopolitan open to an article titled "24 ways to please your man." wider miles reads, while nearby a young boy dry heaves into a garbage can held by his father. an old woman parked in a wheelchair faces the wall. later miles is at a payphone. as he speaks he tries to peel off the metal long distance sticker.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{hi. it's maya. please leave a message.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's miles. listen, i don't know if you even care, but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did. i think you're great, maya always have. from the first time you waited on me.}
<P>__{(bracing himself)}
<D>__{and while i'm at it, i guess you should know that my book is not getting published. i thought this one had a chance, but i was wrong. again. don't bother reading it you've got better things to do. so you see i'm not much of a writer. i'm not anything really. the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. we're leaving in the morning, and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.}
<A>__{what else to say? he hangs up. he returns to his seat. a moment later he extends his legs to look at his new shoes now stained with wine. later jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room, his face purple and swollen beneath the huge white bandage that holds the noseguard in place. miles walks with him toward the exit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm going to need an operation. maybe a couple of them. they have to wait for it it to heal first. then they break it again.}

<D>__{good thing you have a voice over career.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{gonna fuck that up too. i should sue her ass. only reason i won't is to protect christine.}

<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{they walk by us and out the door.}
<L>__{exterior street in solvang day}
<A>__{jack sits in the saab's passenger side with the seat almost fully reclined. when his agony allows him to open his eyes, he glares at the danish themed stores lining the street. an abelskiver maker plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. he hears a strange clomping noise and turns his head to see a man in wooden clogs walking noisily down the street, dressed in a traditional danish costume and carrying a tuba. jack takes a slug of wine. just then miles gets back in the car.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i hate this place.}
<A>__{miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. a closer angle reveals them as vicodin.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{take a couple of these, and you'll learn to love it.}
<A>__{miles opens the bottle and hands jack two pills.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{two for you. and two for me.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{huh. let me think.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you sure you didn't say anything to maya?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{sure i'm sure. and just what are you implying? i'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. what's maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? you're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. not by a longshot.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. just seems fishy.}
<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{the boys lie on their respective beds staring at the tv. jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser mirror like a large dog who has just been neutered.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's it look like to you?}

<D>__{looks like you were in a bad car accident.}

<P>__{(her eyes barely leaving jack)}
<D>__{uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo.}
<A>__{in a wide shot miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as jack's flirtation with cammi continues. the camera pans with miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word "men." later a toothpick dispenser as a finger tips it forward to dispense one. wider miles stands by the cash register and picks his teeth as he watches jack finish speaking with cammi and head his way.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she gets off in an hour, so i think i'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're joking, right?}
<P>__{(seeing that he isn't)}
<D>__{what are you doing? un fucking believeable. can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?}
<A>__{jack rests one hand on miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, miles. i know you're my friend and you care about me. and i know you disapprove. i respect that. but there are some things i have to do that you don't understand. you understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight. and that's okay.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{vicodin. where's the vicodin? my nose.}
<A>__{miles hands him the bottle, and jack frantically pops a couple of pills, chewing them like candy. he sits down and bends over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.}
