<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{stream day on the mossy bank galen and simon unwrap the reforged sword. now the blade carries a faint blue halation. galen walks to the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down into the sand. then he rejoins simon onshore to await results. this time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. such is the power of the sword that even after many leaves, not a single one has come close enough to be sliced. simon is agog and even galen seems satisfied. they clasp hands.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{an edge like no other on this earth.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{well done, simon. thank you.}
<A>__{simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(grave)}
<D>__{i will say goodbye to valerian for you. i'm sorry she's not here, but you know how she is.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{they look at each other for what could be the last time.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{fare thee well.}
<A>__{the old man departs. galen unfolds the bundle and brings out its contents: mail hauberk with coif, studded leather gloves, padded jerkin, a scabbard and a small wooden shield. he lays them out on the stream bank, then strips off his tunic and kneels down to splash some water in his face. as the cups the water between his hands, an image comes alive and shimmers on the surface: valerian, stripping off her own clothes, shyly turning toward him, solemn and romantic.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{galen.}
<A>__{it's as if the vision is speaking to him, but it's not. he spins around and sees her standing there, fully clothed, and possessed of a brisk and businesslike air.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{she throws down a shield. it's remarkable in its construction overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been ingeniously fastened to a leather clad frame.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{it's a shield. i made it. might keep the fire off you. might not. you know, you're an idiot. you're going to die tonight. you'll be ripped limb from limb. this is the last time i will ever speak to you.}
<A>__{galen turns the shield over and over, marveling at it. he fixes her with a piercing look.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(rushing)}
<D>__{another thing. that thing isn't alone up there. there's little ones. young, i think. i don't know how many.}
<A>__{she shudders. galen's eyes are still fastened on her. she's fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and dread are plain.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hatchlings. they'll have to be killed too. anything else?}
<A>__{valerian wants to be bold, but on this final point, can't muster the courage.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(tiny voice)}
<D>__{you're in love, aren't you?}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(slowly nodding)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{that's all right. i understand. she's very beautiful, very brave.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{who is? what do you mean?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{your princess. but i don't care. it doesn't change the way i feel.}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{listen to me, galen bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice; you're going to be dead, the dragon will be worse than ever, there will be more lotteries, and i'm not a boy any more.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{and you'll be eligible because }
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{because i'm still a virgin, and i want you to do something about it.}
<A>__{galen takes her in his arms; she is trembling. he tilts her face up toward his and kisses her.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i am in love. but not with the princess.}
<A>__{their image is reflected in the waters. through the ripples she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes. from afar, they are two tiny figures under the overarching oaks and willows. they embrace and sink down into the deep grass beside the water. the leaves continue their unhurried course downstream.}
