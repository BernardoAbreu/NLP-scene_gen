<L>__{interior hotel kitchen night}
<A>__{tyrell stands at the sink, where karla holds a towel full of ice to his head. nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this }
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{and so could you crazy fool.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you stumbled into my hiding place.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{must have missed the sign.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.}
<P>__{(chilled)}
<D>__{i've never seen a dead body before.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{get used to it.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{who's doing this?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{don't even get her started...it's a long, long story and you probably wouldn't believe a word of it.}
<A>__{tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. he crosses past the stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.}
<C>__{tyrell }
<D>__{i mean, all i know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life... i'm tired, and i'm hungry, and i personally haven't seen one damn psycho killer...}
<A>__{thwack! a steel hook sinks deep into the base of tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject surprise on his face. the women freeze as tyrell dances like a marionette before being hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan.}
<B>__{the fisherman}
<A>__{is in the vent above the stove. he stares out at them from the hood of his slicker. ben jumps from the range onto the floor. karla is in shock. julie yanks her and they flee. as she goes, julie picks up}
<B>__{a loose knife}
<A>__{and hides it in her back pocket.}
