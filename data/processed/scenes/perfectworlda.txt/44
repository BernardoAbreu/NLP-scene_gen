<A>__{sally and adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing. red notices them.}
<D>__{reporter #2 what's the rap sheet on these guys like?}

<D>__{long as christmas eve to a kid. haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios. reporter #3 is there any indication of...}

<D>__{texas rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the d.p.s. share responsibility with the f.b.i. due to the kid being taken. but i doubt they're out of bed yet.}

<D>__{reporter #3 red, how do you plan to apprehend the escapees?}
<C>__{red}

<C>__{red}
<D>__{unoffically? i'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are.}
<A>__{every hand in the place shoots up and ad lib questions fly like bullets.}

<A>__{red steps back and to one side. sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but.... there are no questions. in fact there is utter silence as every raised hand drops. eyes stare. red sighs and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{look, fellas, i got work to do.}
<A>__{and he heads out the door, followed by sally's eyes and every reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the chief. every reporter, that is, except one. he's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand. sally, unsure what to do, looks to him...}

<D>__{you have a question?}

<A>__{sally, steamed, glares at the guy and stomps out of the room.}
