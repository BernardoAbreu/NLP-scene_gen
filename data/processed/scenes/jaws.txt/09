<L>__{interior brody kitchen morning}
<A>__{brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes through and out the burnt out bottom of the kettle.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{did you burn another kettle? y'know you're a fire hazard? this is the third one!}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{i never hear the whistle.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{feed the dogs.}
<A>__{ellen brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from upstairs. she's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call an "instant on" person. mornings are not her best time.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you want to go through those?}
<P>__{(she indicates bag of clothes)}
<D>__{i'm taking them to the thrift shop. it's marcia vaughn's pet charity. pick out what you want to keep it's mostly your city clothes.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(looking through bag, remembering)}
<D>__{i used to wear this to the garden. garbage strikes. dog shit. muggers.}
<P>__{(he puts it all behind)}
<D>__{ship it.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{don't be silly you're going to make summer better for them...}
<A>__{before brody can answer, michael, his oldest boy, enters, holding his hand. there is bright new blood on it, but he is sensibly unconcerned. it's a normal childhood scrape.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{cut my hand. hit by a vampire.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{on the swing? i told you not to play near there until i sanded it down.}
<P>__{(to ellen)}
<D>__{see what your son did?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{go upstairs and bring mommy a band aid.}
<A>__{michael goes on out and upstairs. ellen fumbles in her pocket and produces brody's new glasses, which she holds out to him.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{don't forget these.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<P>__{(he puts them on)}
<D>__{how do i look? older, huh?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i think they make you look sexy.}
<A>__{brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. then more seriously.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{sexy, hm? what was i before?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{older, sillier.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(as he goes to make}
<D>__{coffee, he fumbles}
<P>__{with the new glasses)}
<D>__{i don't want to depend on these things, y'know sometimes you can weaken your eyes.}
<A>__{he looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning. brody's point of view outside the house sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer air, enjoying the very air he breathes.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{let's see...}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
