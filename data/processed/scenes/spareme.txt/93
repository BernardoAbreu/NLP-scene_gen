<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{a coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn dirge plays. the top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black bowling ball inscribed with "the faz" at the head. the pallbearers; theo, breeze, sid, tina, and two other bowlers place the coffin on poles above the grave. a rotund priest sprinkles holy water. sheila stands next to theo, crying. (more) theo wears a glazed look. the priest clears his throat with a loud ahem.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(with pomp and vigor)}
<D>__{bowling!}
<P>__{(pauses to reflect)}
<D>__{bowling is a little like faith. every now and then, we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down..}
<P>__{(makes bowling gesture)}
<D>__{...and scatter those babies like nobody's business. and every now and then we end up in the gutter.}
<P>__{(pauses and gets glum)}
<D>__{buzz fazeli found himself in the gutter of life. trapped in hook alley, throwing nothing balls. but before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled himself out of that gutter. buzz fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling. now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in bowlers' field.}
<P>__{(makes sign of the cross)}
<D>__{he died so that we could bowl with dignity. millie, decked out in mourning black, lets out a wail, steps up and throws a bouquet of flowers onto the coffin.}
<C>__{millie}
<P>__{(sniffles)}
<D>__{i forgive you buzz.}
<A>__{sid leans over to theo.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(in loud whisper)}
<D>__{the faz sure took care a her.}
<P>__{(points to millie, does the cash rub with fingers)}
<D>__{breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger. sid trying to keep a straight face elbows him. sid and breeze approach the coffin. breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.}
<C>__{breeze}
<D>__{nectar of the bowling gods, faz.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{see ya 'round faz.}
<A>__{tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{these are all your perfect games.}
<P>__{(she drops scoresheets onto the coffin)}
<D>__{bowl with god, buzz.}
<A>__{mourners sniff and cry. the coffin starts descending into the ground. a stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets. sheila nudges theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into the grave.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{maybe you were right buzz. maybe i did just come here to take it out on somebody. but, i had to find my father... the muffled beeping of "raindrops keep falling on my head" begins playing from inside the coffin. theo's body jolts. he runs after sheila who is walking towards her scooter.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{buzz is alive, sheila.}
<A>__{the two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk towards their car. theo grabs sheila's jacket.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{theo, buzz is dead.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. he owes me.}
<C>__{sheila}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again. theo lets go of sheila.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{i've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life. she walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{now he's the one who's locked up and i'm the one who's free. if i gotta do this alone, i might as well start now. she revs up and peals out.}
<C>__{theo}
