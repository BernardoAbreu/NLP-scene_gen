<L>__{interior white house war room continuous action day}
<A>__{the place is a buzzing intelligence operations center state of the art for the 1860's. maps of the u.s. and the world are on the wall. various staff and military people work clacking telegraphs, printing machines that grind out reports, etc. grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos, all depicting distinguished bewhiskered men.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{ten of our country's best scientists... all kidnapped in the last year. by general mcgrath, it now seems.}
<P>__{(turns to them)}
<D>__{the fact is, gentlemen, you've both been working on the same case all along. why did it take you so long to realize it?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{well, sir, one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman.}
<A>__{the detectives snicker over that one. grant's had enough.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{i don't have time for this bickering! one week, if we're to believe this...}
<A>__{grant holds out a letter to gordon and west. gordon snatches it, reads:}
<C>__{president grant}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'general grant, the scientists that you seek are in my employ }
<C>__{president grant }
<D>__{ creating a weapons system beyond the pale of contemporary imagination. history and justice are on my side. i suggest you put your affairs in order. you have one week before you will surrender the u.s. government.'}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{this letter was delivered inside this.}
<A>__{an aide presents a glass case. inside is a cake in the shape of the white house.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(reaching inside)}
<D>__{marzipan, isn't it?}
<C>__{president grant}
<P>__{(grabs his hand)}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{suddenly dozens of deadly looking spiders swarm out from inside the cake. gordon jerks his hand back.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{it's mcgrath, sir. the south is rising again. i'm gonna stop it.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{sir, west's obsession aside, mcgrath may be a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not. so whom do we seek? after consulting with intelligence...}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(cuts him off)}
<D>__{mcgrath's headed for new orleans. the longer we stand here talkin', the farther away he gets. i don't need 'intelligence' to tell me that.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{ah, so that would mean you rely on ... stupidity?}
<A>__{grant's had enough.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{gentlemen! i'm leaving today for utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at promontory pointerior}
<A>__{grant points to a map of the united states. the railroad lines have been drawn in... still a gap between them.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{for the first time the united states will truly be united.}
<P>__{(turns, holds up letter)}
<D>__{someone wants us divided. now look, you two are the best i've got. put aside your differences and stop this madman... whoever he is. if you fail, well... we may never know how great this country could've been.}
<P>__{(snaps off a salute)}
<D>__{you have a week. dismissed!}
<A>__{they both return grant's salute as the president stomps off. his aide now approaches.}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{the president has put a private train at your disposal. engine number five, track six.}
<P>__{(holds out a wrapped box)}
<D>__{mr. gordon, the item you requested.}
<A>__{gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with west.}
