<L>__{interior kowolski's bakery kitchen day}
<A>__{a news crew shuttles around a gigantic cookie. standing by are the kowolski brothers, gustov and vol, two short, stocky, men, along with mother kowolski and other bakery family employees. a "30 year anniversary" sign hangs in the background. bruce nolan looks into a make up mirror, desperately trying to place a large segment of wayward hair.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, god, no! the hair's wrong. this is a bad sign.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{we really need to get a make up person?!}
<A>__{the segment producer, ally loman, steps over.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{not in the budget. and not to worry, you're going to look great in this.}
<A>__{she holds out a hair net.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{a hair net? i'm not wearing a hair net. i just did the hair.}
<C>__{ally}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{health code. in the kitchen or around the cookie, you gotta have it.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(to crew: re hair net)}
<D>__{you guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose.}
<A>__{bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{remind me to swing by an elementary school after this and serve lunch.}
<A>__{ally laughs.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you're a thing of beauty. in three, two, one. . .}
<A>__{bruce snaps from pissed to instant charismatic tv newsman. (note: whenever bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his "reporter's voice" that recognizable, too smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have. in mathematical terms bruce's version is to the 7th power.)}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{for three decades the kowolski family bakery has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo. known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, momma kowolski and her sons gustov and vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. tell me guys, how did this idea come about?}
<C>__{gustov}
<D>__{well, vol said to me, 'gustov, why don't we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in buffalo?' and i said, 'yeah, sure.'}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{wow. fascinating.}
<A>__{bruce steps up to the huge cookie.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{the previous buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by gladys pelsnick. but this behemoth cookie clearly proving that gustov and vol have much more free time.}
<A>__{the kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{as we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. what are we really looking at here?}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo? our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in.}
<P>__{(motions his eyes to the kowolski twins)}
<D>__{and finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live.}
<A>__{camera is in close as bruce signs off.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{and that's the way the cookie crumbles. i'm bruce nolan, eyewitness news.}
<A>__{bruce's hair net slips up, puffing his hair into a bun on the top of his head. the kowolskis and bystanders all laugh. the frame freezes. we pull back from the tv and find bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on tv. we are now...}
<L>__{interior bruce and grace's apartment night}
<A>__{bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, grace. she has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, what do you think?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's good.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it sucks. it's a story about a cookie. people with eating disorders will be riveted,}
<P>__{(goes into huge pathetic fan character)}
<D>__{dear bruce, love the bakery piece. i can't wait to vomit so i can make room for more cookies.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i thought it was funny. i love the hair net. how'd you get it to do that?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what? i'm cutting that. they made me wear that stupid thing. i don't even look like myself. the hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. right out of the gate, i lost the hair advantage.}
<A>__{grace looks at a photo,}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, my gosh, look at this one. my sister is so drunk.}
<A>__{she places it in the album.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{grace. try to stay focused here. i need your help.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{aren't you taking this a little too seriously?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it's sweeps grace. it is serious. there's an anchor job open. this is important. this is our future!}
<A>__{bruce points to the tv as he says "future," not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun. grace can't help but giggle.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{bruce collapses into grace's arms like a child. he clearly has a fragile temperament.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. i want my work to matter.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it does matter. you're funny. you make people smile. come on, take a break, help me put this album together.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{grace holds up a photo.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh look at this. it's the first day we moved in together.}
<A>__{it's the two of them, younger, laughing.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(down)}
<D>__{yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. i caught the bouquet.}
<A>__{it's a picture of grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you look pretty intense, hun.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, i was thinking about you.}
<A>__{grace cuddles into bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say?}
<A>__{grace rolls over onto bruce.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you have no idea.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, i may lose my resolve.}
<A>__{grace stands, pulling bruce up.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.}
<A>__{they kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. from the diaphragm.}
<P>__{(newscaster voice)}
<D>__{that's the way the cookie crumbles.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, knock it off... bruce we're holding your story in reserve. now, can we get back to the board so we have something to air today?}

<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{look, jack. hear me out, i'm getting desperate man, i am pushing forty and what have i got to show for it? the point is, i've hit some kind of a ceiling here. some kind of anti bruce barrieri and evan is just lovin' it, by the way. he gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps. maybe i have to be more like evan.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't want to be like evan. evan's an asshole.}

<D>__{you should thank god for donors. we don't have a lot of that type on hand.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{there's your angel now.}
<A>__{bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...}
<B>__{grace}
<A>__{a cotton swab taped to her arm. now he remembers where he heard of that blood type.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(re: her swab)}
<D>__{i hear that all of this winds up in a warehouse somewhere. but you know me, i'm a sucker for this stuff.}
<A>__{the doctors give grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving the two of them alone. grace tentatively approaches.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't even know what i'm doing here. but... when i heard that you'd been in an accident and that you might not make it. . .}
<A>__{she starts to cry.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hey, i'm okay.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{only when i talk., and smile... and y'know, exist in general.}
<A>__{grace laughs. that's one thing bruce could always do, is make her laugh. grace spots the prayer beads in bruce's hand, raises his arm.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh my gosh, you still have those?}
<A>__{bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at grace. he remembers his prayer to god and the emotion wells within him}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{nothing. it's just really nice to see you.}
<A>__{she goes to him, bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior city park day}
<A>__{a big blood drive in progre ss. everyone is there, grace, sam, debbie and zoe, ginnie and jack, the kowolski brothers, momma kowolski, evan, susan , dallas, fred. bobby serves various food items from his cart.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you know, french toast was invented by tavern owner, joseph french, who had a poor knowledge of grammar, and did not know how to use the possessive apostrophe, so he called it french toast instead of french's toast...}
<A>__{pull back to reveal bruce, crutch under one arm, cast on his leg, mic in hand, reporting. he's now talking in his own voice, much more himself.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{this is bruce nolan at buffalo's first annual "be the miracle" blood drive. remember, the life you save may be mine, so hurry down. i had a close call and, well, can you imagine what life would have been like without me?}
<A>__{laughs in the background, from the people that know bruce. bruce walks over to the kowolski brothers.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{in honor of this event, the kowolski brothers have baked a one of a kind, creation.}
<A>__{the brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see that it's a huge syringe shaped chocolate chip cookie.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sure, a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em.}
<P>__{(bruce breaks off a little piece, takes a bite)}
<D>__{mmm, good needle. remember, that's kowolski's bakery. the bakery that gets more air time than a high speed chase.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. the kowolski brothers beam. bruce takes a seat as a volunteer nurse pulls up his sleeve, revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. she ties off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{to be honest, i've never been a big fan of shots. . .}
<A>__{the volunteer now is swabbing bruce's arm and bruce is starting to sweat.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{okay, we're good to go...they just stick it into my arm. breaking through the skin, of course...}
<A>__{the volunteer pulls out the needle and bruce passes out cold. gasps, the nurse leans close, total silence, then:}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{blllaaaa!}
<A>__{bruce jolts awake making the nurse and several people jump. they all laugh.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{had you going, didn't iiiiii1}
<A>__{he reacts to the nurse poking the needle in. everyone laughs more.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{no, this is nothing. in fact, this is the second time i've given blood this week. for those of you who haven't heard, i ' d like you to meet the soon to be mrs. exclusive.}
<A>__{he throws a look to grace who smiles in return. the crowd applauds.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{this is bruce nolan reporting for eyewitness news.}
<A>__{the camera cuts. bruce lowers his mic, turns to grace.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, what'd you think?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know, i thought it was very pleasurable.}
<A>__{bruce smiles, they kiss... as the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd, heading somewhere. bodies clear frame and we see the homeless man sitting on a park bench. his sign reads:}
<B>__{thee end}
<A>__{the homeless man smiles into camera. we continue forward and in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly transforms into the very pleased, face of god, who winks and w. . . e}
<T>__{cut to black:}
<B>__{roll credits}
<A>__{bruce asks god 20 questions}
