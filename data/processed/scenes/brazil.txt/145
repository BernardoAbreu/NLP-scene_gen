<A>__{sam storms back into his office. reaching a peak of frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. within seconds it returns. sam sends it off a second time. it doesn't return a second time, periodically something passes through the tubes causing them to move. sam's pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up. at this point sam's desk begins, as before, to creep through the wall. he grabs it violently. he pulls it. there is a scream from the other side of the wall. sam smiles. th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside sam's office door. it shakes the whole building. sam goes to his door and opens it.}
