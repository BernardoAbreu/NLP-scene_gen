<A>__{the tiny house is heading for a massive storm. carl struggles to steer the house away but is blown into the storm. the steering mechanism recoils and sends carl flying. plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house is rocked in the storm. russell's backpack slides toward the front door.}

<D>__{got ya!}
<A>__{the pack slides toward the open front door. russell screams. he's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut. the paradise falls jar rolls past carl. he chases after it. ellie's chair slides across the room. carl gasps and runs to protect it. the photo of ellie rocks and slides off the wall. carl lunges to catch it.}
