<L>__{interior dining room, the four seasons hotel, new york night}
<A>__{and we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto lowell and mike wallace with jeffrey and liane in the hotel's dining room, having ordered dinner.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{so, is everything okay?}
<C>__{mike wallace}

<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{thank you got saying that...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{do you think we could talk about the taping? tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. and others will deal...}

<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(trying to intervene)}
<D>__{liane, this is a preliminary...}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{you didn't tell her we were taping? what did she think she was coming to new york for?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{...to talk about it. to think about it. i had a plan to ease her into it. but, i really i didn't know how to do that...}
<A>__{jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby bar.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{oh, man.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{who are}
<A>__{these people?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{ordinary people! under extraordinary pressure, mike. what the hell do you expect? grace and consistency?}
<A>__{and lowell leaves the table. and as mike wallace sits at the table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing there.}
