<A>__{the toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.}
<D>__{zoe (v.o.)(cont'd) what's wrong with me? if i were with a real guy doing this, i would've gotten a pedicure. and a wax. i'm pathetic.}
<A>__{the camera pans to the other foot, which is also chipped.}
<D>__{zoe (v.o.) (cont'd) fuck, that one's even worse. and when did my toes get so fat? no wonder i'm alone. i'm a fat toed animal.}
