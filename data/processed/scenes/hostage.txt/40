<A>__{we're in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking palm springs. on the cut, sonny benza, phil tuzee, and charlie fischer are watching tv news coverage of the situation in bristo camino }

<D>__{worst case, it's a bloodbath. the detectives come out with smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass go.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{maybe glen already picked up the disks.}
<C>__{tuzee}
<D>__{i took the call from glen personally. they're still in smith's house.}
<A>__{fischer tries being positive }
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{maybe we're getting too dramatic. it's three kids. they'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that. why would they search the house?}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{you think we should take that chance?}
<C>__{fischer}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{i guess not, too. how much information is in the house?}
<C>__{tuzee}
<D>__{smith was cooking the books for the irs. that means he has it all: the cash flow, where it comes from, how we launder it, our split with the east.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{it's on two computer disks he calls marlon and al.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{what, he's cute? that's his idea of humor?}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{if the feds get those disks, the east coast is gonna take a hit, too. you should let them know.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{no way. i tell them, that old man is gonna handle this from back there.}
<C>__{tuzee}
<D>__{you should warn them, sonny.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{fuck them! now get your head in the game, phil we have to handle this.}
<A>__{benza turns back to the television }
<C>__{benza }
<D>__{put our people on the scene. smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.}
<C>__{tuzee}
<D>__{he knows better than that.}
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{bullshit a man will do anything to save his family. who's running the show up there?}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{they have a chief of police, a guy named talley. i saw him being interviewed.}
<A>__{the television suddenly shows talley making a statement. he looks tired and haggard }
<C>__{fischer}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{hey, that's him. that's talley right there!}
<A>__{benza studies talley, then looks at his lieutenants }
<C>__{benza}
<D>__{find out how we can hurt him. by the end of the day, i want to own him.}
<C>__{tuzee}
