<A>__{the boys come out, rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of them. they look out to the walk, stunned.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{now they are staring at six guys with guns drawn. it was a fucking ambush.}
<A>__{our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point of view reveals the il duce, standing alone, his hands folded in front of him. suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special leather vest beneath. six guns, all different, are holstered on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below his collar bones to his abdomen. connor and murphy don't hesitate. they each draw one of their now unsilenced guns from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of rocco's shoulders. the duke draws his top two weapons and aims.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{and this was a fucking bomb dropping in beaver cleaverville! for a few seconds this place was armageddon! there was a fire fight!}
<A>__{they all start shooting at once. the noise is deafening. the taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is splintering as it is riddled with bullets. smecker is still in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles. rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering against the house. he dives in the bushes reeling. he pulls a gun and starts firing. murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes as well. il duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten feet. he commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk. it's him and connor and nobody is backing down. they both grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. at the same moment, the duke gets hit in the arm and connor takes a bullet in the leg. the firing ceases for a moment. connor remains steady and il duce looks down at his arm and his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{il duce}
<D>__{no!... no! no!...}
<A>__{he drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the right. he fires with wrath as he screams the word no over and over. rocco and murphy return fire from the bushes yelling and swearing, as connor does the same from his position on the stoop. the duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns that extend for 35 feet down the walk. there are also two blood stains. in a frenzy the boys and rocco get up and withdraw some spray bottles from their bags. the begin spraying all their own blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house. they then pick up their things and run off.}
