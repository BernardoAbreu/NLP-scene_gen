<L>__{52 rue de thebes. outside. dawn.}
<A>__{the dawn's light is clear and white. it dispels every shadow and designs precisely every outline. here and there, in the middle of the sky, there are numerous clouds of dust, strangely motionless. in the light, the human figures seem black. seen from a distance, they seem to be ants upon heaps of debris. there are women, motionless, weeping softly, their voices similar to prayer. from time to time, there is a sudden scream, a despairing sob, someone running. another corpse is pulled out from the rubble, bodies mutilated or still intact they are all dead. the people continue to rummage through the debris and to wait around pitifully.}
