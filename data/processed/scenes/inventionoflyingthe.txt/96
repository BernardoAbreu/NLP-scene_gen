<L>__{exterior "church" day}
<A>__{mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and towards the street. in the background we can see the "church" door open.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{hold on a minute!}
<A>__{mark turns, confused and tired. jennifer runs to him. she stands before him, they both stare at each other.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jennifer pulls out mark's letter and shows it to him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm confused.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so am i.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{is any of it... the things you said... are they... i can't think of the word.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{is there a man in the sky?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{why'd you say there was?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{because i couldn't cope with the look on my grandmother's face.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but how could you say something that... wasn't.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm not sure. i just did it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{and what did you mean that i could grow old and ugly and still be beautiful to you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i mean just that. you'll always be beautiful to me.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but what if my looks...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i feel funny.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{me too.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{everything is so hard. nothing is easy anymore.}
<A>__{there is a long moment of silence. jennifer moves closer to mark and looks directly into his eyes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know what i want.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i want short, fat kids with little snub noses.}
<A>__{the biggest smile we've ever seen comes across mark's face.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(jubilantly)}
<D>__{easy! that's an easy one.}
<A>__{just like she did the night on her couch, jennifer reaches over and puts her hand on mark's wrist. they both stare at each other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from both of them. the world is changing before their eyes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{does anyone else know about your invention?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. but i'm sure it won't be long.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{should we tell them right away?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm not sure. i don't think everyone will understand.}
<A>__{greg sticks his head out of the church door.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what's going on out here? everyone's just sitting in there. are we gonna finish this wedding?}
<A>__{jennifer smiles at mark.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{mark smiles back.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{praise the man in the sky.}
<A>__{we rise up as mark and jennifer walk hand in hand towards the church and an unknowable future.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the world's last moment of honesty. a monumental occasion in the history of mankind.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that lowly writer who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become one of the most important men of his age, married to one of the most beautiful women of his time, and passed on the lying gene to generations to come.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{a world without honesty is a world with dreams. a world with pretense. a world with fiction. a world with flattery. and most importantly, a world with true love. put simply, a world very much like our own.}
