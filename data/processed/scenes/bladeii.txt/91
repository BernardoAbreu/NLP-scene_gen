<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop cell night}
<A>__{the dying reaper has now been chained inside the cell. it wheezes and moans, clearly in agony. blade and nyssa stand watch. blade grips the reaper beneath its jaw, turning its face towards us.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{recognize him?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. he was one of the guard's nomak attacked.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{which means he turned about seventy two hours ago.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{right. so why is he dying? he doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind what's killing him?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{time.}
<A>__{blade nicks the reaper's carotid artery with a knife. clear serum oozes out, no red blood cells at all.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{no hemoglobin left. their metabolisms are too fast. they burn out. that's why they're having to feed so often. their systems are self destructing.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{if that's true, what about nomak? he's been alive longer than the others.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{nomak's different. he's the carrier.}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{there's something driving him beyond the thirst. something we're missing.}
<A>__{as they watch, the reaper shakes through its final death throes, then grows still, the nictomembranes over its eyes slowly sliding down. moments later a series of isolated close ups a pair of gloved hands spreads apart the reaper's eyelids. in response, the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically down over the pupil.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{they appear to have a nictating membrane here, like you'd see on a crocodile or camel. shields the eyes from sunlight.}
<A>__{the hands now part the reaper's mouth, probing the seam in the chin, then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the enlarged esophagus. the fingers push back on the gums and the pressure sensitive fangs extend even further in response.}
<D>__{nyssa (o.s.) (cont'd) a bifurcated mandible. more developed masseter muscles and zygomatic bones around the mouth allowing for a much larger, stronger bite }
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{blade, nyssa, and scud are gathered around the autopsy table. the rest of the crew linger further back.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{epidermal layers are thicker, tougher }
<A>__{nyssa begins the y incision along the chest. once again, clear serum oozes out. she cracks open the thoracic cavity.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{ho lee shit.}
<A>__{we see inside the abdominal cavity. a complex, pinkish gray parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{i've never seen anything like this. the reapers are as different from us as we are from you.}
<P>__{(probing the organism)}
<D>__{it's almost as if the virus is re wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{like cancer with a purpose.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{exactly. look at the digestive system. it's been drastically simplified. super charged. and this }
<A>__{she pulls back the lungs a calcified structure encasing a fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be. she taps the calcified structure with a scalpel.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{the heart is completely encased in bone.}
<A>__{she tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps. scud whistles, impressed.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{good luck getting a stake through that.}
<A>__{blade studies the reaper corpse, then looks to the bloodpack.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we've got six hours till sunrise. be ready by then.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{what happens at sunrise?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we take up the hunt again.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{you gotta be fucking joking.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you've seen what we're up against. daylight's the only advantage we've got. they'll be more vulnerable then.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{and so will we.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{look, i care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<P>__{(snarling)}
<D>__{spare me the race card, oj. we're not going out into the sun. it's too risky.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you don't have a choice. you're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.}
<A>__{blade spins and leaves. whistler follows. nyssa watches them disappear into blade's room. reinhardt and the other vampires approach her.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{you buying any of this chocolate elvis bullshit?}
<A>__{nyssa just stares him down, obviously conflicted.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. we already lost priest and lighthammer, who's gonna be next? fuck him. fuck his rules. first chance i get, i'm chowing down on that fucking heehaw sidekick of his.}
<A>__{snowman signs something to verlaine.}
<C>__{verlaine}
<D>__{what do you think, asad?}
<C>__{asad}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{i don't think. i follow orders.}
<A>__{asad looks to nyssa once more perhaps he's even concerned now. she's still staring in the direction blade left.}
