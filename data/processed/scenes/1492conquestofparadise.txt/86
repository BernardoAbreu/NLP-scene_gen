<L>__{exterior mountainous jungle day}
<A>__{utapan and the spaniards are trekking in the hills. fully armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and the vicious insect bites. columbus doggedly keeps up with utapan, who tirelessly trots forward. finally, columbus turns around and sees... nobody. he calls out to utapan.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{utapan! wait!}
<A>__{utapan stops obediently, and rushes back to columbus with comical energy. on their way back, they find one soldier sitting, leaning against a tree. he has removed his helmet. his hair sticking to his forehead. as columbus and utapan walk back, they find another sailor, then another, then the whole group gathered around pinzon. ashen, he burns with fever. he attempts a smile.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{well... you'll have to continue without me...}
<A>__{columbus looks around him what he sees: exhausted men and jungle, as far as one can see.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{no. it's enough. what would you say to a drop of jerez, pinzon?}
<A>__{pinzon grins.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<D>__{and a nice slice of santa fe lamb! i'd sell my soul for it.}
<P>__{(to his officer)}
<D>__{help me up. i've got to piss, gold.}
<A>__{they all laugh as the officer helps pinzon to his feet. pinzon walks a few yards into the jungle starts to urinate. it is red. suddenly dizzy, he reels and collapses.}
