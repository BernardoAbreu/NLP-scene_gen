<A>__{blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of the visitor's center. grant and hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the park tour. a little ahead is gennaro and ellie. gennaro chatters on while ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.}

<D>__{... so naturally, hammond's going to present everything in the best light. i need to know that this park is safe.}

<D>__{i will tell you something that troubles me from the start. the carnivores are all well fed and kept separated from their natural prey. that'll keep 'em alive, but it won't keep 'em happy.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{the carnivores will want to hunt. it's an instinct. and that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed.}
<A>__{further up the hill, moving slowly, hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{gennaro is putting negative ideas into ellie's head. he's a naysayer. i have no affection for that type of thinking.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{don't worry. ellie makes her own judgments.}
<A>__{at the base of the hill timmy and lex toss a baseball.}
