<D>__{no, i don't really think too much about that kinda thing.}
<A>__{swann shoots braver a poisonous look.}
<L>__{exterior embankment night}
<A>__{joe and camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad tracks below. neither says anything. joe seems strangely preoccupied. camille decides to break the silence.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{your parents comin' to the game tomorrow?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{my mom's dead. my dad has never seen me play.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{guess he's not that interested in football.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{but you're one of the best players in the country.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{he's just not into it, o.k.?}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(chastised)}
<D>__{o.k.}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{what's goin' on, joe? you ask me out here, like you wanta talk about somethin', then you don't say anything. you worried about tomorrow?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no... i'm worried about the days after that. i just. i don't know... i feel like tomorrow's gonna be my last game. i want to stay up, make the time go slow.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{why would it be your last game? you afraid of getting hurt?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, that'd be a relief. then, at least, i wouldn't be a failure.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{joe, why are you thinking like this? why would you be a failure? you're having a great year, you're a heisman trophy candidate, you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{how do you know what's waiting for me? you don't know me at all.}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i don't know you? how can you say that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{because you wouldn't be here now if you did. you only know the guy that's supposed to make millions in the pros.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{is that what you think? that i'm with you for the money?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why else?}
<A>__{infuriated, she slaps him across the face.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{fuck you, joe.}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about your money. i don't even give a shit about football. and you know what? maybe you're right, maybe i don't know you.}
<A>__{she turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a train whistle. joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view. camille stops, turns back, sees joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry. joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train. horrified, camille runs down the embankment toward him.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{joe! joe! my god, joe, what are you doing? no! no!}
<A>__{as the train approaches, it's horn blaring, joe lies face down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him. she falls to her knees screaming. under the train, we see joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. it's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly. the train passes. camille looks up, afraid to breath as joe lies motionless on the tracks. suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees. she lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. she hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{god joe, oh god, are you allright?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(drained)}
<D>__{yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. guess you've really seen the dark side now, huh? you should've gotten out while you had the chance. before it all goes to hell.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i don't wanta get out, damnit. what's wrong joe? why would it all go to hell?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm a kane, camille. that's all it takes. we're cut out to be drunks and fuck ups. we never live up to expectations. it's in our blood. my dad, brothers, uncles we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up. my dad went the longest. waited till he was playin' triple a ball, before he hit the wall. sometimes i feel like i'm just waiting for my turn. the better i do, the closer it gets.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you're not like them, you can beat all that. you can stop drinking, you can break the chain.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{if i gave up that, i wouldn't be much of a football player. and if i wasn't a football player, what would i be?}
<A>__{the question hangs in the air.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you'de still be joe. and i'd still love you.}
<A>__{he pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against each other.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{just don't say i never warned you.}
