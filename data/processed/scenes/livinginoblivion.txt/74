<L>__{interior wardrobe room. day}
<A>__{camera is close on nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head. camera pulls back to reveal sachiko, the costume designer putting the finishing touches to nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown. nick stands nearby, smoking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just as we pull up to your apartment palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{god. was it something he ate?}
<C>__{sachiko}
<D>__{stand up, please.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{can he work tomorrow?}
<C>__{sachiko}
<D>__{turn around, please.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't know that either. but i'm not worrying about it. i had this dream last night where i was on the set. you were in it, and another woman, someone older. anyway, everything was going wrong. the harder i tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. and you know what that dream was telling me, nicole? you just got to roll with it. and that's what i'm doing, i'm rolling with it. so, we'll just shoot the dream sequence today.}
<A>__{just then tito walks in.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, tito. you look great, man.}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{listen, if there's anything i can do to make you... if you need... uh, just let me know.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{put a stool in the bathroom.}
<A>__{tito walks out, followed immediately by sachiko, leaving nicole alone with nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{did i just offend him?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{"short notice?"}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{come on; that was nothing. i'm the one who called him "toto." jesus, i'm out of it. i dreamt i was on the set last night too.}
