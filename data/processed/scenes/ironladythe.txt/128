<L>__{interior cabinet room. downing street. 1990. day}
<A>__{margaret, seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by a subdued cabinet. most of the familiar old faces pym, heseltine, etc. all now gone. howe the last enduring minister. she casts a gimlet eye over the grey suited men around her.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{there it is again! why not?}
<C>__{minister 1}
<D>__{because }
<C>__{minister 2}
<D>__{because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{nonsense. arrant nonsense. this is a simple proposition. in order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege something, anything! if you pay nothing, you care nothing. what do you care where you throw your rubbish? your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? it's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem it's the government's problem! your problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. you haven't had to fight hard for anything. it's all been given to you and you feel guilty about it! well, may i say, on behalf of all those who have had to fight their way up, (and who don't feel guilty about it) we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community!}
<B>__{silence.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{and i see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the european union, to retain british sovereignty of britain, the integrity of the pound! some of you want to make concessions. i hear some of you agree with the latest french proposals.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, why don't you get on a boat to calais? yes, why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85% of your income to the french government!}
<A>__{she has subdued them utterly. the silence is terrible.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{right. what can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session, lord president?}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{and why have we not made more progress to date? what is that? is that the timetable? i haven't seen that. may i see it?}
<C>__{howe}
<D>__{here it is, prime minister. of course.}
<A>__{howe pushes the papers over to her. she picks up a pencil, starts to read. the ministers watch as, quickly, she starts to score through the words.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{the wording is sloppy here, and here.}
<C>__{howe}
<D>__{if you say so.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i do say so.}
<C>__{howe}
<D>__{it's merely a first draft...}
<A>__{margaret looks down at the paperwork.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. there are two "t's" in "committee"!}
<A>__{she presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the offending word.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{this is shameful. shameful! i can't even rely on you for a simple timetable! are you unwell? yes you are unwell. give me the pencil, give it to me!}
<A>__{margaret snaps her fingers at howe, gesturing for his pencil, scratching away, ringing the offending word again and again. the ministers stare at the scene appalled, utterly and wretchedly embarrassed.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{if this is the best you can do i had better send you to hospital, and i shall do your job as well as my own and everyone else's. gentlemen.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{as the lord president has come to cabinet unprepared, i am obliged to close this meeting.}
<A>__{she waits for them to take their leave, but they sit there, frozen.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{good morning!}
<A>__{slowly, the men gather their papers and file out of the room, leaving margaret alone. she sits, gathering herself, hands shaking. the roar of protest surges through (archive footage) a huge macabre papier mache thatcher head, grimacing with one eyeball blinded and the other detached and hanging bloody on a cheek.}
<C>__{angry crowd}
<P>__{(chanting)}
<D>__{can't pay, won't pay! can't pay, won't pay! can't pay, won't pay!}
