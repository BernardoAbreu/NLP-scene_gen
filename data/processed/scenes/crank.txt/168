<A>__{chev and eve hit the floor of the moving elevator with a crash and roll out onto the 4th floor. the workers are all in a panic, standing by their sewing machines they’ve obviously heard the shots. the supervisor is walking around, shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in korean to keep working. the supervisor, all of five feet, walks right up to chev and eve, and starts screaming at them in broken english.}

<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{the door on the far end of the room busts open and hoods pour in from the stairwell. they spot him. chev and eve duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of machines toward the windows. the hoods fan out. they play cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and koreans while the supervisor, oblivious, continues screaming and forcing the workers back into their chairs. chev puts a finger to eve’s lips, calming her momentarily... ... then comes up behind a youngish hood and shoves the hood’s gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at least fifty years old, operated by a korean woman even older.}
