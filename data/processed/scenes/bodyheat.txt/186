<A>__{the lawyers pile out of the elevator. a few carry briefcases. racine finally appears. he too carries a briefcase. he looks across the huge lobby at the entrance to a restaurant bar.}
<L>__{interior restaurant bar skyscraper day}
<A>__{racine sits at the bar with a drink. once more, he glances diagonally to the end of the bar, at a guy in a three piece suit. the guy seems to be looking at racine whenever he isn't watching the front entrance. finally the guy can control himself no longer. he picks up his drink and walks around the bar to the space next to racine. his name is michael glenn and he's bright, successful and irritating. the two men are on the edge of remembering each other.}

<D>__{we know each other, don't we?}
<P>__{(racine smiles, uncertain)}

<D>__{hey, this is silly. you're not still mad about that gourson business?}
<P>__{(racine shrugs, takes a drink)}
<D>__{we had to do it. costanza practically insisted we sue you. listen, nobody at our place likes malpractice against other lawyers.}

<A>__{racine looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{did you ever meet a lady named matty walker? you'd remember her. a very hot number.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{when was this?}
<C>__{glenn}
<P>__{(trying to remember)}

<C>__{glenn}
<P>__{(a slimy grin)}
<D>__{hey, i was trying to get you work.}
<A>__{he starts to move away. racine grabs him by his tie and pulls him back hard. the people nearby turn in alarm. racine speaks very quietly to the startled glenn.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{did you tell her about gourson?}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{jesus, are you nuts?}
<A>__{racine twists his grip on glenn's tie. glenn starts to choke.}
<C>__{glenn}

<A>__{racine lets him go.}
