<L>__{interior family car day}
<A>__{william jumps into the backseat of the white ford country sedan station wagon, carrying books. ("see ya pubes!") mom continues driving william and anita home from school.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(cheerfully, by rote, to william in back)}
<D>__{put on your seatbelt. i don't want you flying through the windshield.}
<A>__{anita examines her own un fastened seatbelt, which mom hasn't noticed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{we got our annuals today }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(cheerful, automatic)}
<D>__{"received" your annual.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(looking at his photo)}
<D>__{i look so much younger than everyone else.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{enjoy it while you can.}
<A>__{camera drifts from mom to anita, who can take it no longer.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{mom. it's time.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(pleasant, pointed)}
<D>__{can this wait until we get home?}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{mom, pull over.}
<A>__{tell him the truth. tell him how old he is. mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(as in "be quiet")}
<D>__{he knows how old he is.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{the other kids make fun of him because of how young he looks. nobody includes him.}
<A>__{they call him "the narc" behind his back...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they do?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what's a "narc?"}
<C>__{anita}
<P>__{(bleeding for her brother) a narcotics officer!}
<D>__{elaine well what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(ever the peacemaker)}
<D>__{come on you guys. it's no big deal. i'm 12. it's okay. she skipped me a grade, it's okay. big deal. i'm a year younger. they're 13, i'm 12 }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't i?}
<A>__{their silence is eloquent.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(confessing, in a rush)}
<D>__{i also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{so... i'm... how old?}
<A>__{a heavy quiet. she and his sister ignore him, as they now debate the subject with each other.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you lied to him! you make such a big deal about the truth and you lied!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(that one hurts)}
<D>__{he never asked.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{what like he's going to ask if he's as old as he thinks he is? don't you realize, this is going to scar him forever?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{honey... sweetheart... don't be cleopatra. we have to be his mother and his dad.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you put too much pressure on him!}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(apprehensive)}
<D>__{how... old...}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{and when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{... am i?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{i skipped you an extra grade. you're eleven.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(horrified, voice crackling) eleven?}
<A>__{he looks at his body, the information affects him physically. new sounds come from way down deep inside. mom now begins speed rapping, trying to stem the leak. she starts the car.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{so you skipped fifth grade. there's too much padding in the grades. i taught elementary school. 5th grade unnecessary. nothing happens in the 5th grade. all teachers know it, no one talks about it.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(still in shock)}
<D>__{e leven.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{and you skipped kindergarten because i taught it to you when you were four.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(still horrified, looking at his body)}
<D>__{this explains... so much...}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{you've robbed him of an adolescence!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{adolescence is a marketing tool.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{he's got no "crowd"... no friends...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{anita reaches out to her brother. with the compassion of a saint, she offers this:}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{honey, i know you were expecting puberty. you're just going to have to shine it on for a while.}
<A>__{deeply embarrassed, william shrinks down in the seat. mom monitors his face constantly. she is raw and sincere... and yes, inspiring:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{who needs a "crowd?" you're unique. you're two years ahead of everybody. take those extra years and do what you want. go to europe for a year! take a look around, see what you like! follow your dream! you'll still be the youngest lawyer in the country. your own great grandfather practiced law until he was 93. your dad was so proud of you. he knew you were a pronominally accelerated child.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(heartbroken, can't help herself)}
<D>__{you're rebellious and ungrateful of my love.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{well, somebody's gotta be normal around here!}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(blinking, still can't}
<D>__{believe it) eleven.}
