<A>__{jack stands inside of a stall in the men's room. he has just crossed a certain frontier in his mind and stepped in to the area known as no man's land. he quickly takes off his overcoat and jacket and we see attached to his arm a harness made up of straps and springs. he opens his briefcase and attaches to the harness a .32 caliber beretta. he fumbles with the adjustments, racing against time. finally, he seems to have adjusted everything just so. then he lowers his arm to his side. then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands and the harness slams the .32 caliber beretta from his forearm straight into his palm. he resets the gun back into the forearm position. he has a look of grim determination on his face. the only question is, is it the look of someone who is crazy enough to do what he is contemplating.}
