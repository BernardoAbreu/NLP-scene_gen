<L>__{exterior interior mustang night}
<A>__{they're driving. grace and bobby, wordless, each thinking in separate worlds. grace wipes her hands. the bag with the money between her legs. the baretta is back in the bag.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{jesus, did you have to kill him?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{get real bobby. he was gonna kill you and me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he was in love with you grace. he would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he was a cop , grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he was a scumbag!... he wanted me , bobby. these guys don't let go! even when they're dead ... (softer) you don't know what it was like, bobby. those two, they were the same.}
<A>__{a silence. the oncoming road.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{so, aren't you going to ask me?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{ask you what? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't you want to know...? i bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{let it go, baby. it's the past. i got a past...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't you really want to know? was jake my daddy? was i fucking my own daddy? don't you want to know that?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what do you want me to say!}
<A>__{she's yelling, emotionally out of control.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yes! i was! i was fucking daddy! and i married him!... i married him...okay?}
<A>__{she looks at bobby, forces him to look at her. finally:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know why !}
<A>__{she drops back in her seat. tears come.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{all i wanted was to be a kid... he took that from me... they all did... (very quietly, dangerously) they treated me like meat. a piece of meat. fuck me . blow me . bend over . stick their fingers up my ass ... fuck them! fuck the whole town! they deserved to die!}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and us grace? what do we deserve?}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{"nin chonk, nin chonk," my mama used to say in apache. "your worst is doing this to you," she said, "your worst has killed you." and "be go tsee" "you will find out the result of what you have done..." just when you think it's over, when you've gotten away, it begins. cause you never get away.}
<A>__{bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road. can he still love her? she seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said she could.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's easy to judge someone else when you don't know nothing about it... i'm apache, bobby. you don't eat what i eat. you don't see what i see. don't judge me.}
<A>__{a silence. two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through the strangeness of an arizona desert at night.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't want to think anymore.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{then drive...}
<A>__{the lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness.}
