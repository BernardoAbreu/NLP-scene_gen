<L>__{exterior neighborhood street day}
<A>__{a thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in this italian neighborhood, his name is hyman suchowsky. he carries his tools as he comes home from work. he is pursued and tormented by a couple of italian youths, about his own age, eighteen.}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{kid, where do you live?}
<C>__{another}
<D>__{where'd you get those nigger lips?}
<A>__{he tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys, steps in front of him and stops him.}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{say 'bread' in italian.}
<C>__{another}
<D>__{he dunno.}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{go on; how do you say 'bread' in italian? if you're from the neighborhood, you should know how to say 'bread' in italian.}
<A>__{an amused peter clemenza steps forward from a local coffee house, to preside over the fuss. he's a 'big' man in the neighborhood, and loves a fight.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{this kid lives around here, but he can't say bread in italian.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{that's 'cause he's jew. look at those pregnant lips!}
<A>__{he giggles at his own joke.}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{are you a jewboy?}
<A>__{the boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.}
<C>__{italian boy}
<D>__{well, if you're not a jew, say 'bread' in italian. see, he can't.}
<A>__{and with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face, sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a clatter. the other italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to the boy's stomach. hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement as well. for a moment, they are rolling around on the sidewalk, two against one, hyman taking the worst of it.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{alright, alright, cut it out.}
<C>__{second italian}
<D>__{what for? he killed jesus christ!}
<A>__{clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{i said cut it out!}

<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{maybe i know how you can make a couple of extra bucks working as a mechanic.}
<A>__{the boy seems agreeable.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{but you gotta know how to keep your mouth shut, and fer chrissakes, get rid of that name. i will call you johnny lips.}
<P>__{(he giggles at his own humor again)}
