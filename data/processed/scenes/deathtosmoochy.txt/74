<L>__{interior nora's living room evening}
<A>__{on nora's tv screen, we see the black and white image of rickets the hippo doing the "klunky wunky dance." nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. there is a knock at the door. she gets up and ejects the "best of rickets" tape. she opens the door. to her surprise, randolph is standing there.}

<D>__{just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{okay, so maybe i commandeered a stray shekel or two. big deal! compared to what smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{where do you shop?}
<A>__{randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{come on. have you lost all affection for me? after what we once had?}

<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{why we broke up i will never know.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you turned into an asshole and i didn't love you.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{we could've worked through all that.}
<A>__{he leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so violently he almost falls over the coffee table.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{damn it, nora! the public is clamoring for me! i'm a fucking patriot! mopes is a nazi! he's evil! he's probably even gay! you should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car!}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(suddenly suspicious)}

<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{what does what mean?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you said he was checking you out in the car. what car?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{no... it's just a vibe! a nazi homosexual vibe! it emanates from the television! the whole smoochy costume... with the erect horn... i mean, what's that all about?}
<A>__{nora starts to walk closer to him. he backs up.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you're talking awfully fast, randolph.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i still love you! let's go on a date!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{were you at that rally? tell me! did you have something to do with this?}
<A>__{she backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{did you set sheldon up?}
<A>__{randolph just looks at her.}
<C>__{randolph}
