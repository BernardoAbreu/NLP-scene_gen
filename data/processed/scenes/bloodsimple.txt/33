<A>__{we are looking across the tiled floor toward the front doorway. the room has the dim gray cast of daytime inside a shuttered house. we hold on the empty foyer as we hear an intermittent high whining sound. we hear the padding of feet on carpet, and then the clatter of nails on tile as opal, marty's german shepherd, trots into frame and circles the foyer, still whining. she jumps up and scratches desperately at the front door. a slow, rhythmic pounding is very faint on the track.}
