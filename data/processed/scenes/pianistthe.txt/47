<L>__{interior office and floor, schultz factory day}
<A>__{the name 'samuel szpilman' being written on a certificate. the clatter of sewing machines. schultz, a fat, sweaty german is filling out the form at his desk. majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him and having a quiet laugh. in the doorway, szpilman and father. the small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter. schultz stamps the certificate, hands it to majorek, who gives it to father.}
