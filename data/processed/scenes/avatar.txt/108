<C>__{jake}
<D>__{get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{not now. tomorrow we leave for iknimaya.}
<A>__{grace walks past jake, starts making herself coffee.}
<C>__{grace}

<A>__{jake scans the pictures tacked up around grace's workstation.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what did happen at the school?}
<A>__{grace looks up from making coffee. her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children. finally }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{neytiri's sister sylwanin stopped coming to school. she was angry about the clear cutting.}
<A>__{grace sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{one day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up they'd set a bulldozer on fire i guess they thought i could protect them.}
<A>__{grace's voice stays oddly calm as he tells this terrible story, while getting milk out of the refrigerator.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse.}
<A>__{macro as she pours the milk her hand is shaking.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{they killed sylwanin in the doorway. right in front of neytiri. then shot the others.}

<D>__{i got most of the kids out, before they shot me.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{jesus.}

<P>__{(turning to him)}
<D>__{that kind of pain reaches back through the link.}
<A>__{grace sits down at the table, looks intently at jake.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's a job. learn what you can but don't get attached.}
<A>__{grace looks at him with real pain in her eyes.}
