<L>__{exterior beach house day}
<A>__{an old lady, grace witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. she acknowledges tina's distant wave, and turns her attention back to the skiers.}
<B>__{angle on the skiers}
<A>__{having a wonderful time. terry is good, criss crossing the wake, showing off.}
<B>__{close on terry}
<A>__{rushing through the water, waving, stunting.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{faster! faster!}
<A>__{she waves at diane, who leans over the controls, to coax more speed out of the old engine.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent wake.}
<B>__{on the surface}
<A>__{terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. she glances at it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{porpoise! look! a dolphin!}
<A>__{the fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. she puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{closing in on the wake, crossing it. terry on the surface the fin cuts across her path. too late to maneuver, terry hits the looming gray back of the shark. the skis bump, leave the water, terry takes a spectacular spill. the rope around her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, preventing her from shouting. she flounders as diane slows the boat to see what's happened.}
<B>__{angle on the boat}
<A>__{turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or hurt herself.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{terry! you okay?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{help! help!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{okay, okay, coming...}
<A>__{she still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation she hasn't seen the fin.}
<B>__{angle on terry}
<A>__{hysterical, pulling herself hand over hand up the rope, trying to get to the boat.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{closing in on the thrashing figure.}
<B>__{terry}
<A>__{screaming, as the shark rises from the deep and takes her. suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under. in the boat diane looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. she pulls the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with nothing on it just a cleanly bitten end.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{terry!}
<A>__{then the shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. fuel spills from a ruptured line.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{help! god, help!}
<A>__{she throws things at the shark, which slides back under the water. distant angle on the boat from the beach diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams floating across the water; at this range they sound like the normal shrieks of teen age girls having fun.... angle on the boat close as the shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. diane hurls seat cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on. she fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare pistol. she cocks it and fires point blank at the shark.}
<B>__{close on the shark}
<A>__{the flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of the shark explodes in a sheet of flame.}
<B>__{diane}
<A>__{a last flash before the gasoline explodes.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no o o o o o...!}
<A>__{a sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the shark forgotten. she falls into the water as the ruined boat overturns and there's an oily explosion.}
