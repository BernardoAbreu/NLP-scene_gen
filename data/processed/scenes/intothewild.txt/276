<D>__{you have to tell us everything.}
<A>__{(note: this scene should largely be improvised. they all know their characters, their history. jan and rainey are doing great. and while chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16 year old girl are upon him, chris lays out his travels and his plan for alaska. jan remarks, "i guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to mexico, hop freight trains, and score beds at inner city missions, you can figure out alaska too.") at this point, the pretty 16 year old girl who had had her eyes on chris, takes the stage with an acoustic guitar, introduces herself as tracy, then sings an innocent love song of her own composition, stealing seductive glances at chris throughout the performance.}
