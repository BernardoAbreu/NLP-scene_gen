<C>__{chorus }
<D>__{to the late night double feature picture show.}
<A>__{the song ends with church bells ringing joyously as the image expands to wide screen. the still frame bursts to life as the doors of the denton catholic church are flung open and mendelssohn's wedding march resounds from the church organ. the young married couple, ralph and betty hapschatt appear followed by a crowd of friends and well wishers throwing confetti and shouting excitedly. the minister shakes ralph by the hand while ralph slips him a $20 bill. photographers take pictures. brad majors, a young slightly awkward, clean cut american in his mid twenties, comes over the congratulate ralph. brad and ralph shake hands.}

<D>__{well brad, i guess we made it huh!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well i don't think there was any doubt about that you and betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on dr scott's refresher lectures.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{tell you the truth brad, she was the only reason i came in the first place. science was never one of my favourite subjects but i sure with dr scott could have made it today.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{yes, janet and i are both fond of him. we drove over to see him last vacation. it's a shame his new job took him away from denton.}
<A>__{betty, the bride, throws the bouquet. janet catches it. she squeals with delight. the guests cheer.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{hey fella. it looks like it could be your turn nexterior}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{who knows...ha ha.}
<A>__{ralph & betty drive off. guests wave and shout, brad & janet with great enthusiasm. guests begin to disperse. janet & brad linger outside the church. so do a strange family : an old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter. they resemble the quaker family in "american gothic", a painting. the mother (magenta) and father (riff raff) stand outside the church doors. their daughter (columbia) goes inside. the family, and the minister (frank n. furter), and the guests all resemble characters we shall meet later at the frank n. furter place.}
<C>__{janet }
<D>__{oh brad, wasn't it wonderful. didn't betty look radiantly beautiful. just an hour ago she was plain old betty monroe. now she's mrs. ralph hapschatt.}
