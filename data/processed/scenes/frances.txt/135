<A>__{behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain. in the street a police car cruises slowly past.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{salesman says, 'i don't care. i gotta have a martini.' so the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... then he hears it. this big roaring in the street. rrraaaaaaa!!!}
<P>__{(stomping her feet)}
<D>__{gigantic footsteps... coming closer. stopping.}
<A>__{we see the police car again... it stops out front.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. this huge man stomps in. picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror whiskey and glass flying everywhere.}
<A>__{two cops appear at the window, looking in.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he turns to the salesman: 'what the hell're you doing in here!' salesman says, 'i'm just drinking a martini.' 'oh yeah?' the guy says. 'well you better get outa here! big otis is coming to town!'}
<A>__{everyone laughs. a long moment of enjoyment. then frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops.}
