<A>__{sam 1 heads into the return vehicle. its dominated by the cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic sleep on their way back to earth. sam 1 pops open the lid and starts frantically searching the chamber for traces of the previous sams, eventually finding particles of dust in the cracks he closes the lid. a video showing a technician in a white lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid of the pod. it's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of the audio coming from the cryo pod. sam 1 pushes a button on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.}

<D>__{...relax and breathe deeply. the cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to earth. as you begin to get sleepy, think about the magnificent job you've done, and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.}
<A>__{relaxing music begins to play. after a moment the music stops. there is a pause. then an almighty pulse of light from the cryo pod. this is how sams past have met their end. nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod. sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it really is a vehicle in the process of his search he finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring. suddenly sam 1's attention is on the floor beneath him. he appears to be kneeling on some kind of panel like a tablet in the return vehicle's floor he presses his ear against the panel knocks the panel sounds hollow.}

<A>__{back in the return vehicle, sam 1 stands over the panel in the floor. he uses the crow bar to prize the panel open this takes an extraordinary effort the panel eventually lifting like a manhole cover. sam 1 can't believe his eyes. at the top of the open panel, leading down into darkness...there's a ladder.}
