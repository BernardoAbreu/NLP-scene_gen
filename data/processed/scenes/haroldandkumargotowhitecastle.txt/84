<L>__{interior freak show's house}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk inside and see the hottest chick of all time (liane) walk out of the kitchen. she is dressed daisy dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{hi. i'm freak show's wife, liane. would you boys like some pink lemonade?}
<A>__{harold and kumar can't move. they're awestruck.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{let me go bring in a pitcher.}
<A>__{liane leaves to go into the kitchen. along the way, she turns on a record player, which starts playing a creepy song about jesus christ. harold and kumar look around the house. there are crosses and bible verses on the walls, along with freak show and liane's wedding picture...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{okay. it's official. we've entered the twilight zone.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, liane is fucking hot!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{she's not ugly.}
<A>__{liane comes in with the pitcher of lemonade. she pours them drinks and hands them the glasses...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, tell me liane how are things between you and freak show presently?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{oh, never been better. we love each other very much.}
<A>__{kumar looks disappointed. harold, however, is intrigued...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{can i ask how does a guy...like freak show...end up with a woman like yourself?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well, i met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. freak show was very shy back then you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. but he had the most amazing voice like a baby canary.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other in disbelief "are we talking about the same freakshow?"}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well, one day after easter service, i told him how much i enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. the rest is history. and we've been in love ever since.}
<A>__{harold ponders this for a moment. he and kumar begin drinking their lemonade.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{so you boys gonna fuck me or what?}
<A>__{harold and kumar spit the lemonade out simultaneously. they look at each other in complete shock. kumar turns to harold.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{wait a second what about freak show...and this whole christian thing you guys have going on?}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(a little offended)}
<D>__{oh, so just because we're passionate about our lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no, i just...}
<A>__{liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. harold and kumar stare unabashedly. harold looks outside the window, where he sees freak show changing the tire, apparently busy.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{nevermind.}
<P>__{(to kumar, swinging his hand)}
<D>__{okay, rock, paper, scissors...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{sorry if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{come on. give me the double stuff.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other confused.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i'm not sure we quite understand...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{i want you both inside me simultaneously.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. kumar turns to liane...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{um, are we talking about one hole or two?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{however you want to do it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{sorry, no thank you.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{shh! two holes it might not be that bad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shotgun anus!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{forget it! i don't want our balls rubbing against each other. no way!}
<A>__{kumar turns to liane in desperation...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what about blow jobs?! can we get blow jobs!?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well...okay.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{can you help me with this...?}
<A>__{liane walks over to harold, seductively. harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. she takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. harold looks over to kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. the shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts.}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(to harold, re: breasts)}
<D>__{do you want to play with them?}
<A>__{harold looks over to kumar, then back at liane...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{okay, let's do that.}
<A>__{liane takes harold's hands and places them on her breasts. kumar looks on enviously. liane moans in pleasure as harold starts to massage her chest. at that moment, freak show enters the room, holding a particularly threatening tire iron...}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{hey boys i changed your tire...}
<A>__{freak show sees harold with liane...}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing with my wife!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(scared shitless)}
<D>__{uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her!}
<A>__{freak show runs over to harold and grabs him by the collar!}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{i most certainly did not say that!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no. you did. we both heard you.}
<C>__{freak show}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{positive.}
<A>__{freak show ponders this.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{oh...my mistake then.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome?}
<B>__{freak show pulls his pants down and puts his arms around harold and kumar...}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{who wants the first reach around?}
