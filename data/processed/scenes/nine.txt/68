<A>__{a shadow moves inside the bunker. now even young guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back. and then she comes out. saraghina is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. she has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on carla. she looks at the boys. she may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them. she takes a deliberate step. young guido stands his ground. she takes another step and holds out her hand. young guido opens his hand with the coins. she looks at the money. is it enough? but she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins. she stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. she returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show." saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body... a dark vamp begins.}
