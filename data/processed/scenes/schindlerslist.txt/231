<A>__{poldek pfefferberg holds up a pistol, feels its weight, points it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{careful.}
<A>__{pfefferberg smiles, lowers the gun, kneels beside an open crate of weapons: a couple of revolvers and rifles, an old carbine.}
<L>__{interior factory day}
<A>__{from high above the factory, stern can be seen among the machines talking with a worker. the man points up and returns to his work. stern stares up, puzzled. he locates a ladder that connects the shop floor to a series of overhead planks and, with trepidation, climbs. he reaches a shaky landing high above the machines, navigates the primitive catwalks with great care, comes to a large water tank near the workshop ceiling.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{stern.}
<A>__{above the rim of the tank, amid rising steam, schindler's head appears. then disappears. stern climbs a set of rungs on the tank, reaches the top and finds inside, lolling in the steaming water, schindler and the blonde stenographer from the trial.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{neither schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit embarrassed. only stern. he tries hard to pretend the girl isn't there, but he just can't.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i will talk to you later.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, no, what, what is it?}
<A>__{schindler floats over closer to him, waits for him to report whatever it is he has come to report, leans closer. finally, quietly }
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{do you have any money i don't know about? hidden away someplace?}
<A>__{schindler thinks long and hard...}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{silence except for the gently lapping water. half joking }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{why, am i broke?}
<A>__{stern glances away, doesn't answer, just stares off. and a slight, slight smile, a gambler's philosophical smile upon being purged of his wealth, appears on schindler's face.}
