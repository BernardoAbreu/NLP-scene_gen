<A>__{standing at the sink shirtless, john pours alcohol on the wound in his side. he mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies a bandage, fresh from the box. he pulls a new shirt and jacket from a target bag. a moment later, now dressed, john stuffs the trash bag full of cash into his backpack.}
