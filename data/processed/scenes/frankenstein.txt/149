<L>__{ext field day}
<A>__{a pair of feet drop heavily in frame. thump crack! a shoe flies off. the crowd gasps. mrs. moritz collapses wailing to the ground. elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. victor just stands staring. angle widens to reveal justine dangling from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still twitching.}
<L>__{ext same field night}
<A>__{another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. the body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. victor looms from the darkness, staring. and then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs his shoulder. victor whirls and finds himself staring up into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous necrotic features bathed in a purple white glare of lightning. he screams as the creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball to eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. softly:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{frankenstein.}
<A>__{victor is speechless with horror. the creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. look there. victor does. lightning dances in the sky, illuminating mont blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then the creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness. victor falls gasping. the awful truth dawning. he rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh god. oh god! no! nooooooo!}
<A>__{screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking to his knees, weeping helplessly:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh god. justine. forgive me.}
