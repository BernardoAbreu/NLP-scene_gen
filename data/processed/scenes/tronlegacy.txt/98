<C>__{boole}
<D>__{this way! down the pipe!}
<A>__{rush helps krod, quantz and boole into a data pipe. one by one, they whirl away in the flow of chromatic data. flynn and mega have a breathless moment to consider rush.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{he's better than i thought.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{he's been sent for a reason.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{what reason?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{don't know yet. sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan.}
<A>__{mega struggles to compute. rush turns to help flynn down the pipe. mega assists. flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. rush holds him, but loses his balance, slides down.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega! quick! jump!}
<A>__{but she hesitates velcronic beams snag her from behind pulling her back onto the ledge. rush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see: mega, hauled away by x takk troops.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega!!!}
<A>__{fighters, krod, rush and flynn surf down the data whirl, accelerating away from the hot zone. x takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the flow gone.}
