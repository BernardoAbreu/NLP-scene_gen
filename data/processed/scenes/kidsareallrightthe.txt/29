<L>__{interior allgood house tv room later that night}
<A>__{nic and jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable. they see laser on his way out of the house.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{hey bug, come here. we're watching "locked up abroad: uganda."}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i saw it. it was gnarly.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{clay's.}
<A>__{jules and nic shoot each other a concerned look.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{don't be back late, okay?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{can i have a hug before you go?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{mom...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{just a quick one. please!}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{hug her. that's what she's there for.}
<A>__{laser leaves. nic hits mute on the tv, looks at jules.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{ugh. maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what? "are you and clay fucking?"}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{"exploring" is the word i'd use...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{and what if he is "exploring?" this is the age for that. why should we care?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{we shouldn't...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{look, we don't even know what the deal is. we're jumping to conclusions.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it.}
<A>__{nic's comment hits a nerve in jules.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what are you trying to say?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{what do you mean, what am i trying to say?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it feels like there's some subtext here.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i don't know: like mother like son? is that it? both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?"}
<A>__{nic won't go there.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{yeah. maybe not.}
<A>__{nic clicks the volume back on, freezing jules out.}
