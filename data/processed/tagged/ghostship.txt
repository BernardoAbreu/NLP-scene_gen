<L>__{interior barge day}
<A>__{crewman epps (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps down into the darkness. she stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and water moving over its hull on the other side.}
<L>__{interior barge later day}
<A>__{epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. she kneels. as the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.}
<L>__{exterior barge later day}
<A>__{epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. she stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. it is a typical summer day in the southern bering sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north west. she closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward.}
<L>__{exterior barge bow moments later day}
<A>__{up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents. epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional. the product of a rocky childhood in the pacific northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now. and under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's insulite pants she might even be considered pretty. she clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. she climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her. she pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end.}
<L>__{exterior arctic warrior later day}
<A>__{dodge and greer look on from the stern, where the boat's name "arctic warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate texan and former merchant marine. greer (42), is the boat's first mate, african american, originally from some sweltering red neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north. they watch as epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a slow leak.}
<A>__{she unclips and drops to the deck.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{what's slow?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe twenty gallons an hour.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{where from?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{amidships starboard at the beam. just under the waterline. i don't think it's a problem.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{hear that, dodge? epps don't think it's a problem.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i will sleep good tonight knowing that.}
<L>__{interior arctic warrior pilothouse continuous day}
<A>__{the view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar and gps navigation displays glow. murphy, the ship's master, pilots the boat. he is 48, at sea all his adult life, and most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to bet his life on. a walkie talkie crackles awake.}

<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(lifting the radio)}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{murphy turns back to see greer, epps, and dodge looking up at him from the stern.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{the number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. they must've pumped it before we left sitka.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{of course they did.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{let the buyer beware.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what do you say, dodge?}
<C>__{dodge }
<P>__{(taking the radio)}
<D>__{if it started out at twenty an hour the piece of shit'd be at the bottom of the gulf by now. whether it'll make st. lawrence is anybody's guess.}

<A>__{high and wide as the arctic warrior pulls the barge against the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior port germaine st. lawrence island day}
<A>__{the shores of st. lawrence island open into a small port town of mainly pre fab buildings as the arctic warrior approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one side as it moves into the harbor.}
<L>__{exterior port germaine docks later day}
<A>__{a smaller harbor tug helps the arctic warrior jockey the listing barge to the dock as epps and dodge jump off to tie her up.}
<L>__{interior arctic warrior pilothouse moments later day}
<A>__{greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the turbines.}
<L>__{exterior arctic warrior continuous day}
<A>__{murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat russian man, vasili (60) and a mechanic in grease covered orange coveralls approach from the dock.}
<C>__{vasili}
<D>__{i thought you say tuesday.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{better late than never.}
<C>__{vasili}
<P>__{(seeing the listing barge)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you got a leak in the number nine compartment.}
<C>__{vasili}
<D>__{no, no. you got leak.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you pump it out and re seam the hull, she'll be good as new.}
<C>__{vasili}
<D>__{that cost me twenty grand at least.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{fifteen, at the most.}
<C>__{vasili}
<D>__{twenty. you knock off twenty and then we see. after my guy looks at it.}
<L>__{interior vasili's office day}
<A>__{in a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, vasili cuts a check as murphy and greer look on. he tears it out of the book, handing it across the desk to murphy, who inspects it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<C>__{vasili}
<D>__{you want fair pay, make hamburger for mickey d. otherwise, please to sign.}
<A>__{vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. murphy signs.}
<L>__{exterior shipyard day}
<A>__{greer and murphy walk back toward the dock.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{he'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i must be in the wrong business.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you got that right.}
<C>__{greer}
<P>__{(imitating vasili)}
<D>__{better than "making hamburger for mickey d."}
<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{a typical port town bar. except this one is on an island in the middle of the bering sea. epps lines up a shot at the pool table as a couple of seamen check out her ass and a tattoo of wiley coyote poking out of her pants. greer reads a paper near by. murphy enters, crossing to the bar where dodge nurses a beer and a cigarette. murphy throws down an envelope with dodge's name on it. dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack of hundreds.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{much obliged, skipper.}
<L>__{interior bar later night}
<A>__{the place is a little more crowded now as epps pushes her way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. she buys two beers and pays the bartender from her envelope of cash. she takes the beers back to the far wall where a young off duty coastguardsman stands. he takes one, they laugh.}
<B>__{at a table}
<A>__{beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, dodge, greer and murphy look on at epps across the room, who is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.}

<C>__{riveter}
<D>__{whyn't you mind your own business, chief.}
<A>__{murphy turns to see a shipyard riveter, a big man holding a beer, still wearing his welding leathers. murphy turns back to epps and the girlfriend.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{as i said, what seems to be the trouble?}
<C>__{riveter}
<D>__{didn't you hear me, grandpa? or you got your hearing aid turned down?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i heard you. but i'm choosing to ignore you. epps, let's go.}
<A>__{epps starts forward but the riveter stands in her way, taking murphy by the collar.}
<C>__{riveter}
<D>__{these ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you got about two seconds to get your paws off me, tarzan.}
<C>__{riveter}
<D>__{or what?}
<A>__{or whack! murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks in two over the riveter's head. dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half he still holds, shaking his head. the riveter's hands fall from murphy's collar and his legs buckle. some of his buddies hold him up as greer reminds some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{epps?}
<A>__{he looks to epps like let's get the hell out of here. she grabs her coat.}

<C>__{coastguardsman}

<L>__{exterior arctic warrior day}
<A>__{murphy, greer, and dodge ready the tug to leave as epps approaches on the dock. she jumps down onto the deck, a spring in her step and a song in her heart.}

<D>__{show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you epps?}

<D>__{i didn't want it to turn out this way.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{murphy, don't you see what's happening?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i think i see it pretty well.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's the ship. the ship's making you think this way.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i know a little bit about human nature and what i've seen only confirms that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a trap. there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it's just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there's nothing supernatural about greed. and that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't give a damn about the gold.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i wish i could believe that. either way, you know what i've done. i've got no choice.}
<A>__{he raises the shotgun.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he prepares to fire, when a concussion rocks the ship. epps ducks and murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the vent behind her. a screeching of metal deep in the ship sounds as she gets up, diving for cover as murphy shuttles the gun again.}
<B>__{with epps}
<A>__{epps scrambles behind a deck vent.}
<L>__{exterior chimera continuous day}
<A>__{the ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.}

<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{there's no reason to make this any more difficult than it has to be.}

<A>__{as epps holds there she sees the vent opening. she pulls herself up and climbs inside.}
<L>__{interior chimera air shaft continuous day}
<A>__{epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its width. she squeezes through the fan blades and drops down where several vent ducts lead in different directions below it.}

<A>__{murphy comes to the vent duct where epps went down.}
<L>__{interior chimera air duct continuous day}

<L>__{interior chimera passageway continuous day}
<A>__{the vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.}

<L>__{interior chimera passageway continuous day}
<A>__{murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.}
<L>__{interior chimera passageway continuous day}
<A>__{epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her. she stops. footsteps sound at the end of the passage. epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there. the footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the footsteps stop. epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end, the sound of creaking metal, as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard. it stops. all is silent, when the hatch creaks again at the other end. she begins moving toward it. as she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship. a creaking sounds behind her. she turns, just as murphy steps into view. she ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her. she scrambles on her belly as murphy fires again. she swings down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.}
<B>__{at the bottom}
<A>__{epps gets up, runs.}

<A>__{murphy follows, when a rumbling sound can be heard.}
<L>__{interior chimera below decks with epps continuous day}
<A>__{epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the rumbling grows in intensity. though it seems to resonate throughout the ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom. she steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening. the ship begins to shudder. the steel bulkheads visibly move and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back and forth.}
<L>__{interior chimera below decks with murphy continuous day}
<A>__{murphy slows and finally stops.}
<L>__{interior chimera below decks with epps continuous day}
<A>__{a few rivets pop in the hull. then a few more, as the rumbling}
<B>__{grows still louder.}
<A>__{epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, when the rumbling reaches a pinnacle. the rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way, a massive crag of rock smashing through}
<B>__{with a tremendous boom and a torrent of seawater.}
<A>__{epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through the chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a}
<B>__{horrendous tumult of noise and steam and sparks.}
<L>__{exterior chimera continuous day}
<A>__{the chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious rock promontory of a small island.}

<L>__{interior chimera below decks with epps continuous day}
<A>__{epps comes up for air. a clatter of all manner of debris, tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead as the ship eases over. a boiler breaks loose of its stays. epps looks up to see it coming right for her. she ducks under the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she was.}

<A>__{epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and the bulkhead.}
<L>__{interior chimera cargo hold continuous day}
<A>__{the gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall. murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in his pockets.}
<L>__{interior chimera below decks continuous day}
<A>__{epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.}
<B>__{above the water}
<A>__{the level of the water has now almost completely reached the deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.}
<L>__{interior chimera cargo hold continuous day}
<A>__{the water is threateningly high as murphy pockets one last ingot and makes his way for the exit.}
<L>__{interior chimera below decks continuous day}
<A>__{epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck. she swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the murky water. several more forms appear. they are human, suspended in the water. as epps looks, the several forms have become many. they are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before. as they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges. it is katie. she reaches toward epps, as if beckoning her to take her hand from the other side. epps raises her hand, taking it. the girl leads epps down into the murky darkness where she finds a way out. she takes her back further, coming to the breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water. katie stops at the breach. epps turns to her. she only looks back at epps. epps turns away, swimming upward toward the light of the surface.}
<L>__{exterior ocean surface moments later day}
<A>__{epps breaks through, gasping for air. she looks to see the chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully awash.}

<L>__{exterior ocean surface continuous day}

<L>__{exterior chimera top deck continuous day}
<A>__{water rushes in as murphy wades out onto the chimera's top deck. he is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft portion rising above him as the bow sinks.}
<L>__{exterior island continuous day}
<A>__{epps collapses on the rocks.}
<L>__{exterior chimera top deck continuous day}
<A>__{as the ship moves lower, murphy pushes off. he bobs under momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. the forward smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.}
<L>__{exterior island continuous day}
<A>__{epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.}
<L>__{exterior chimera with murphy continuous day}
<A>__{as the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that pulls at murphy. murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the smokestack's opening. the ship sinks further and murphy is pulled to the edge of the stack. he frantically grabs for something to hold on to, without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing water.}
<L>__{exterior island later day}
<A>__{epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on at the chimera, her stern rising high above water as she goes down, when the rumble of engines can be heard. she turns to see a coastguard plane sweeping low over the chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts and waves her arms.}
<L>__{exterior island later day}
<A>__{the coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time dropping a survival pack. the chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical now, slipping further and further under. epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.}
<L>__{exterior ocean with chimera continuous day}
<A>__{the afterdeck of the chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the camera pushing in to "chimera" as the name comes to the water, then slips slowly beneath the surface. and the camera follows, moving into the water to reveal that, beneath the surface, there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the ocean.}
