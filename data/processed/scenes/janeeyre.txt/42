<L>__{exterior day. moor house the garden moors.}
<A>__{jane stands between diana and mary high above moor house. they are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks. they watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison. their eyes land upon moor house.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we've lived here all our lives but the house must be shut up now.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we can't afford to keep it on. diana and i will return to our charges in a few days and st john will go to his parsonage.}
<A>__{down below them, st john leaves moor house and walks towards the village. jane watches him.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{it'll be a hard parting for us. we may not see him again for years.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why ever not?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he means to be a missionary. he's going to india to do gods's work.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{can he not do god's work here?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this quiet parish will never do for him; he almost raves in his restlessness. it breaks our hearts.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{st john burns with talents and ambition. but he lacks the means for advancement here. our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on god's altar.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we've tried to persuade him to stay but in some things our brother is he is }
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{inexorable as death.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we are now without father. we'll soon be without home and brother.}
<A>__{jane feels a powerful compassion for them.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{in one thing you are fortunate.}
<A>__{she looks over at the horizon.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{you have each other.}
