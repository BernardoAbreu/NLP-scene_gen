<L>__{exterior dussander's back porch day}
<A>__{todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when dussander steps onto the porch. he carries with him the bottle of bourbon and a glass.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{then there is nothing for me.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{but there is. as the years go by, as i get closer to the grave, your hold on me will become worth less and less. a man five, ten years older than i worries more about his ailing heart than being extradited to israel. and there will come a day if i live long enough when i decide what you know no longer matters. then, and only then, i will destroy my document.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{but... but so many things can happen to you in between. accidents. sickness. you could slip in the shower, for christ's sake...}
<A>__{dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette. he begins to sing softly, then gets caught up in the song... todd turns away, angry.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{que sera, sera... whatever will be, will be... the future's not ours to see... que sera, sera...}
<A>__{pause. dussander sees he has pressed todd's button. he moves closer.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{my dear boy, i see you thinking about it, even now. it is in your eyes. killing me. it would take only a flick of a knife. or maybe push me down the steps, make it look like an accident? i am old. you are strong. you are angry. good assets for killing. but there is something missing...}
<A>__{dussander speaks with a near whisper in todd's ear.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{to have some one in your control. to have them know that they are alive because you have not decided to the contrary. do you have that power? ask yourself. it is no easy question. i think you know that.}
<A>__{there is a long pregnant pause. then todd lets out a sigh, as if to dismiss what he has just heard. he turns to face dussander.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you know this means we're through. you won't be seeing me around here anymore.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no, i suppose i won't.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm never coming here again.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{and so it comes to an end. here.}
<A>__{dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boy's glass.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{a drink. to our lives together, the beginning... and the end.}
<A>__{todd picks up his glass.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i think you should fuck yourself.}
<A>__{he clicks his glass against dussander's.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my boy, don't you see that we are fucking each other?}
<A>__{he drinks. todd, reluctantly, does the same.}
