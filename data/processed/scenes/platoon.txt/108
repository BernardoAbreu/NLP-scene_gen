<A>__{it explodes. this is about three times the intensity of the rpg. the jungle floor shakes, trees splinter. barnes is knocked to his knees, rimaces in pain. hoyt, barnes' radio operator, screams out as a fist sized chunk of hot shrapnel sticks in his back. he's screeching, frantically trying to shuck the radio from his back, his fatigue shirt smoking. barnes jerks the radio off hoyt's back, knocks the man to his knees and unsheathes his bayonet. ripping off the back of his shirt, barnes sets to digging out the shrapnel.}
