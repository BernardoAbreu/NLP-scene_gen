<L>__{exterior pine view streets night}
<A>__{pine view is throwing a party. it's in full swing. a couple of guitars. a banjo and a trombone. everyone dances. the postman walks with briscoe, sees mrs. march as her letter is read to her. catches a glimpse of abby dancing with ford. he seems, for the first time, truly happy. for that matter, so does briscoe.}

<D>__{things are getting better. getting better all the time.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i don't know who you are, but i do know i was wrong about you.}
<A>__{the postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{got a letter for you, sheriff.}
<A>__{briscoe turns it over in his hands, looks up in wonder.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{it's from my sister. i thought she was dead.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you thought wrong.}
<A>__{briscoe has tears in his eyes. the postman continues on, embarrassed but affected.}
<B>__{dance}
<A>__{the postman taps ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him and abby. ford steps aside. a beat before abby decides it's okay. they begin. her eyes are on her feet, careful that she doesn't take a misstep. but his eyes are on her. and over it all, bleeding in, the sound of hoof beats.}
