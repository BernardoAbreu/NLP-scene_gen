<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{okay, so that was the living room; over here is the kitchen i plan on getting all new fixtures in here and down that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath.}
<A>__{he stops at an extra, no particular purpose, nondescript room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{this is sort of a lounging area.}
<P>__{(as nobody says anything)}
<D>__{you know, just in case you want to...}
<A>__{he searches, can't think of how to finish the sentence in any impressive way. he gives up, finishes weakly:}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{... lounge.}
<A>__{skipper snorts with laughter, but cuts it off when dwight gives him a look. toby, trying to be good, bites his lip to keep from laughing.}
