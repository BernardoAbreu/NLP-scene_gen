<A>__{ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the robbery "suspects" on a bulletin board. it's pictures of saddamn and the devil worshipper guy. beside him is a sketch of the pervert. the images are on the bottom points of a pyramid. on top of the pyramid is a combination drawing picture of ronnie. the body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. the whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea is that he defeats them all. ronnie sits back in his chair and stares at the board. all of a sudden, there is a knock at the door. the door opens and brandi peeps her head in.}
