<L>__{interior caroline and toby's kitchen one hour later}
<A>__{caroline, toby and roy are eating at the tiny table. roy is good looking in a meaty, hairy chested sort of way. though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. toby, delighted, holds a winchester .22 rifle across his lap a peace making gift from roy.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{... i found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. and i think i got a job lined up doin' tune ups in a texaco station. how you like it at winstead's?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{how do you know where i work?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i been here almost a week.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you followed me around? for a week? watching?}
<A>__{roy doesn't answer. he just wiggles his eyebrows like groucho marx.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{and how did you ever find me?}
<A>__{again, roy does the groucho marx. he turns to toby.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you like the rifle, toby? 'jack,' i mean.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's the best present i ever got. i just love it.}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{i'm going to pretend i'm shooting.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't point that thing at anybody or i won't teach you to shoot.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's not loaded!}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you heard me: anybody or any thing.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's got no bullets, for god's sake.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't make me speak to you again.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i will point it at the sky, then.}
<A>__{caroline sighs. toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. caroline starts to clear the table. roy jumps up to help her.}
