<L>__{exterior port royal navy dock day}
<A>__{two sailors on sentry duty, murtogg and mullroy, take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. but when jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{this dock is off limits to civilians.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sorry, i didn't know.}
<A>__{music drifts down from fort charles. jack looks up, shields his eyes.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{some sort of to do up at the fort, eh? you two weren't invited?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{no ... someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this must be some important boat.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{ship.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ship.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{captain norrington's made it his flagship. he'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the spanish lake.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{commodore.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{right. commodore norrington.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's a fine goal, i'm sure ... but it seems to me a ship like that }
<P>__{(indicates the dauntless)}
<D>__{ makes this one here just a wee superfluous.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{oh, the dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough but there's no ship that can match the interceptor for speed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that so? i've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the black pearl?}
<A>__{mullroy scoffs at the name.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{there's no real ship as can match the interceptor.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{the black pearl is a real ship.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{yes it is. i've seen it.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{you've seen it?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{you've seen the black pearl?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{you haven't seen it.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{yes, i have.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{you've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{... no .}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{but i've seen a ship with black sails.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the black pearl. is that what you're saying?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{... no.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<P>__{(turns back to jack)}
<D>__{like i said, there's no real ship as can match hey!}
<A>__{but jack's not there. murtogg and mullroy look around, spot jack standing at the wheel of the interceptor, casually examining the mechanism.}
<C>__{mullroy }
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. the sailors hurry toward the gangplank.}
<C>__{mullroy }
<D>__{get away from there! you don't have permission to be aboard there!}
<A>__{jack spreads his hands in apology.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just such a pretty boat. ship.}
<A>__{the sailors study him suspiciously.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{smith.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{what's your business in port royal, 'mr. smith' ?}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{and no lies!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{none? very well. you've rumbled me. i confess: i intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{i said, no lies.}
<C>__{mullr0y}
<D>__{i think he's telling the truth.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{he's not telling the truth.}
<C>__{mullroy}
<D>__{he may be.}
<C>__{murtogg}
<D>__{if he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you.}
<A>__{murtogg and mullroy consider that point }
