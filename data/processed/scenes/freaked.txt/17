<A>__{the car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign that says "freekztm thiss waey" with a messy arrow... we zoom in to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of the sign, which reads "freekz is a registered trademark of elijah c. skuggs enterprises. any unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited without prior written consent."}

<L>__{exterior freekz compound}
<A>__{the car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just past a sizzling electric fence. rick, julie, and ernie get out and look around. it's eerily quiet. there is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base. ernie looks hard at the big eyes. he turns away for a second, then spins around again. the eyes are looking in a different direction. ernie shakes his head and unwraps a chocolate bar.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{isn't it great? it's so "real"...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{real stupid.}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{let's go. this place is dead.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{yeah. where are all the weirdos?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{there are no weirdos here.}
<A>__{startled, they turn to see elijah c. skuggs, a twisted, haggard old man. he takes a bite out of an ice cream cone which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino cherry on top. elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary eyes. we now realize the giant head is molded in his image.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{mutants, yes. genetic nightmares, definitely. children of hell and twisted masses of living, breathing tormented flesh, certainly. but as for weirdos... not a one. unless of course you count me! ha ha ha!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me.}
<A>__{elijah ignores him. julie shoots him a look and smiles at elijah.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm julie. and you are...}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{elijah c. skuggs, proud proprietor of skugg's fabulous freak land and mutant emporium. but you knew that. after all, you've ventured miles away from civilization, hospitals, telephones,}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{police... how may i help you?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{drop dead.}
<A>__{elijah smiles, unfazed. julie glares at rick. she smiles apologetically at elijah.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{we'd like to see your freak show. you see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco system.}
<A>__{elijah nudges ernie.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{and you come to me looking for weirdos?}
<A>__{ernie shrugs. he goes to take a bite out of his chocolate bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{hey! what the }
<A>__{he looks behind him, and there about ten feet away is...}
<B>__{a hulking bald man}
<A>__{warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily. this is toad. julie and rick turn and see him.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(repulsed)}
<D>__{eeuuuwww...}
<P>__{(composes herself and waves)}
<D>__{ahem. hello.}
<A>__{toad doesn't respond to her waves.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{mr. toad is my... assistant. as for the show, i'm afraid the next parade of deformity isn't until tomorrow night...}
<A>__{rick and ernie pretend to be disappointed. they turn to leave. julie's sincerely upset.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, just our luck...}
<A>__{elijah grabs rick's shoulder and turns him around.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{however! i do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy. i don't usually share it with the general public...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{we're deeply honored. but no thanks.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{yeah. we really must be }
<A>__{he raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! he turns to see toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily. hmmm. elijah is already leading julie towards the shed.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{the sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media. you don't traffic in human misery. you show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{yes... yesm i see...}
<A>__{he looks over to rick and ernie with a grin that says "where'd you find this nutty chick?" rick shrugs and follows, taking ernie with him.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{what the heck. we'll see some pickled dog brains, maybe some pictures of women with, you know, added equipment.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{and to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses.}
<A>__{elijah holds the shed door open for them. it's pitch black inside. julie enters. rick and ernie follow.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{what the hell, coog, these people are weird, but they seem nice enough.}
<B>__{a cute bunny}
<A>__{sits outside the shed. thwap! toad lashes out with his ten foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. he shuffles into the shed, crunching contentedly. elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear a lonq peal of evil laughter from inside.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{ah ha ha ha ha ha! he he he! ha haha! he ho he he ha ha! ah ha ha heha! yah ha ha ha hee hee ho ha he he!}
