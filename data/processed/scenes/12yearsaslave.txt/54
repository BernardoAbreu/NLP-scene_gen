<L>__{interior freeman's great room later}
<A>__{it's an odd, ironic scene. the slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within freeman's house. cape plays a painful tune on a fiddle background music as freeman tries to line up a small group of the slaves, he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression. sometimes his patience gets the better of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves. the business has the air of an etiquette class, though what freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more "sellable." he works with them in groups of five or so.}

<D>__{tallest to smallest, understand? are you taller than her? then you'd go before her. do it. move.}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{keep your heads up. a sense of direction; that's how you look smart. none of those saucer eyes. rid yourself of that smile. look like a goddamn grinnin' monkey. put the least thought in your head. c'mon, now. think of somethin'.}
<A>__{weary of cape's playing, solomon moves to cape. he asks:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{can you play a reel?}
<C>__{cape}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{nah. i don't know no reel.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{if i may...?}
<A>__{cape looks to freeman:}
<C>__{freeman}
<D>__{he sick of your caterwaulin'. let him play, boy. let's see what he can do.}
<A>__{cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to solomon. solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. his fingers stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. but as he warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful the slaves all clap along. some dance along. all admire his work. freeman chief among them.}
<C>__{freeman }
<D>__{keep on. keep on.}
<A>__{solomon continues to play.}
<C>__{freeman }
<D>__{a damn sight better than you, cape. a damn sight better.}
