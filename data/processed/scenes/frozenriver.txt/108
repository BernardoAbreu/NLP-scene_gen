<A>__{she opens the door, but no one is there. at her feet she sees a pringles can. in it: the cash she left at her mother in law's house for her son. she looks towards the woods but there is no sign of anyone. she shuts the door. inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board, and a blanket. she wraps her pillow in the blanket around the board in the mohawk tradition and picks it up. she tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall, then hangs it on a hook on the wall.}
