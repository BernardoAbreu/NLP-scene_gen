<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{the mood is tense, grim. riker, worf and troi are gathered around a schematic of the enterprise. the lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by the color red, representing the borg advance through the ship. a they watch, another section of compartments and corridors suddenly turn red. riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to various points along the schematic.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{all right... we've lost control of eight decks... three cargo bays... one shuttlebay.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{do we have any idea how many borg we're dealing with?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{we saw at least thirty...and there are twenty two enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including commander data.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the collective.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{even data?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise. command codes, security protocols...}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{if they control data, they control the ship.}
<A>__{a grim beat.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we can't worry about that right now. let's concentrate on what we can.}
<A>__{they stare at the schematic.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{to control the enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. main engineering... or the bridge.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we have to cover both possibilities.}
<P>__{(to troi)}
<D>__{we'll take care of the bridge. worf, take your men and seal off main engineering. turn it into a fortress nothing gets in.}
<A>__{worf nods and exits. as riker and troi exchange a tense look...}
