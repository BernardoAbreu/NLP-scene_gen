<L>__{exterior landfill ghetto miracia's cabin night}
<A>__{blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle lit altars garish pictures of saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls.}
<B>__{miracia}
<A>__{sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well thumbed bicycle playing cards. she's ancient, with a mouthful of gold capped teeth and cataract clouded eyes. blind.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{is something wrong, my friend?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're blind }
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{there are other ways to see. sit.}
<A>__{blade approaches, uneasy. miracia deals out the playing cards on a rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross formation.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{perhaps you have brought me something an offering for the orishas?}
<A>__{blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. miracia nods, then flips over the first card in the center pile a one eyed jack. she sighs, grave }
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{hold out your hands.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i didn't come here to get my palms read. i need something translated.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the table. miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching her fingertips to her lips.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{sangre. written in blood.}
<A>__{she runs her hands over each line as if it were written in braille. some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind around them rises.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{this is an old tongue, from an old world. it concerns lamagra.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{who is lamagra?}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{the vampire god. this speaks of his return.}
<A>__{miracia's fingers search the parchment again.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{" there will come a day walker."}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"his blood will call the sleeper from beyond the veil of tears."}
<A>__{blade stares at miracia, shaken.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{his blood ?}
<A>__{the old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{the day walker's blood is a disparador a trigger, you see? for lamagra's return. one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a tide of blood."}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(recalling the phrase)}
<D>__{"the blood tide".}
<C>__{miracia}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes. the vampire apocalypse. it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how do i stop it?}
<A>__{miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{the great wheel turns, my friend. the dark is rising. how would you fight a shadow?}
<A>__{miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. the candles have burnt themselves down to nothing.}
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{i am tired. dawn is coming.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{but i just got here }
<C>__{miracia}
<D>__{you've been here longer than you think.}
<A>__{blade rises, looking to the horizon. incredibly, dawn is coming. as he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment fragment out of his hand. he tries to snatch it back, but the fragment is quickly borne away. he watches it disappear into the sky, then turns back miracia is gone. blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be found. camera pulls back, isolating blade amidst the ghostly squalor. from our vantage point, he looks like any other homeless phantom.}
