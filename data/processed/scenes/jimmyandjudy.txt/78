<A>__{buddy is standing outside of a piece of shit trailer. he's the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give jimmy a hug in the previous scene. he's surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best to make jimmy and judy feel at home. jimmy films as buddy gives them a walking tour of the group of trailers by the river. judy's with them as well.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{we got like thirty five trailers here. long as we've got some that's empty you can stay in one. sometimes people come in and we got get you a tent or fuck, everybody's friendly you can always find a bed to crash in.}
<A>__{jimmy's panning around the landscape. people are watching them walk with buddy. it's almost as if they've got some kind of celebrity status because they're with him.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{it don't look like much but we do some pretty good partying around here. ya'll are welcome to stay as long as ya like. fuck it, you can stay forever. there's only two rules. don't mess around with the labs which are down back there...}
<A>__{jimmy's panning again, but buddy grabs hold of the lens.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{woah... no filming that shit. seriously. that's part of rule number one.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{don't even go near there with the camera, and two is no cops, but fuck, seeing what kinda shit you guys got into, i don't think we gotta worry about you calling 'em up for a visit.}
<A>__{buddy laughs at his own joke.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{other than that, ya'll can do whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want. you wanna do some of the stash at the parties, that's cool too. we'd like it if you do it, normally we'd say you gotta sell some too, but rodney says y'all's is a special case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til the heat's off for sure, that could be months or... shit, years for you guys. but no one up here's in a fucking hurry.}
<A>__{jimmy pans around capturing the natural beauty and picturesque scenery of the camp.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{look at you. little bitch from the nut house, and you got yourself one sweet looking bride! i still can't get over the tits on this girl.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{come here sweetheart.}
<A>__{jimmy pans back and catches an image of buddy as he grabs judy and puts his arm around her.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{we're gonna have a party for y'all tonight. you know that? we have parties damn near every night, but this one's gonna be special just for you guys.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{you like that sweety?}
<A>__{buddy's squeezing judy just a bit too tight.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{sure buddy.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(to jimmy)}
<D>__{nice piece of ass you got here. best you keep an eye on it so it don't wander off on ya.}
<A>__{they've arrived at a trailer.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{we're here!}
<A>__{jimmy pans back up at the trailer that's going to be theirs. from the outside, it's a disaster, peeling paint and cracked windows. buddy gets in front of the camera, reaching for it.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{shit! y'all's on your honeymoon. ain't gonna film it yourselves.}
<A>__{buddy pulls the camera from jimmy's hand and points it at jimmy and judy. judy waves. jimmy looks a bit uncomfortable though he tries not to show it.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{that's nice.}
<A>__{shaky amateur camera style as buddy zooms in on judy's chest, closing jimmy out of frame.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{let's go inside.}
<A>__{judy turns.}
<C>__{buddy }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{hold on! hold on!}
