<D>__{judith... oh god, judith. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{tom is near and holds her as she puts her head on his chest.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... but i can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... the same thing would have happened to me... or frank... or joe... and there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...}
<P>__{(self reflective)}
<D>__{i used to try and... always came up short. i don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. i remember this boy i'd see up on the blackfeet reservation. he was sixteen. great kid. strong. he'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. snapped his neck, paralyzed him... after the accident, i'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. his mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. and what was left was nothing but anger... it's like the boy i knew just went away somewhere...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i know where he goes.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i know you do. don't you disappear.}
<P>__{(holds her tighter)}
<D>__{you do whatever you have to, to hold on...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i will tell you one more thing... when pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what i think?... i think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... that's what i think.}
<A>__{grace listens to this. as tom holds her in silence, it's almost as if they were father and daughter...}
