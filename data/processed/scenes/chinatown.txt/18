<L>__{exterior pond gittes and japanese gardener day}
<C>__{gardener}
<P>__{(to gittes)}
<D>__{bad for glass.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(not understanding)}
<D>__{yeah sure. bad for glass.}
<A>__{the gardener nods, and is off, leaving gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming. he looks at the tool the gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. he then spots evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway. he casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise. evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair. she's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, mr. gittes?}
<A>__{gittes is a little taken aback at seeing evelyn. he is annoyed as well. nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{actually, i'm here to see your husband, mrs. mulwray.}
<A>__{he laughs. a little nervously. he waits for a reply. there is none. the chinese butler appears on the veranda.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{would you like something to drink?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what are you having?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{iced tea.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah. fine, thank you.}
<A>__{chinese butler nods, disappears}
