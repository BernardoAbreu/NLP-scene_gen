<A>__{janek works frantically as the nightly storm rolls in. suddenly consoles come alive. the nav computer comes back up but janek has taken half the instruments apart. janek scrambles to restore the components he's removed.}
<C>__{navigation chamber}
<A>__{the war party pursues the sleeper ray in the lead now, watts right behind him david's inert head under her arm. glasse and stillwell bring up the rear. the orrery is transformed no longer a neutral star map, but a flight plan laid in from lv 426 to earth. the sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands gesturing. in watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory: waves of energy dancing under the sleeper's touch. rivers of information flowing. he finishes his work as they enter. ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.}

<A>__{they emerge into the corridor: empty. a moment of confusion.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{pilot's seat. this way.}
<A>__{they move toward the pilot chamber and find it empty too. the seat vacant. the door standing open. as they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor directly behind them silently unravels. the sleeper is revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit. he steps forth. obscure devices clutched in his fists. too late they perceive him. they spin. raise their guns. vanity and foolishness. this is the wrath of an angry god. it seems time slows down. the air roars in their ears. their guns snap and bark impotently. and then the sleeper strikes. the missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. neither solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied in the fabric of space itself. the first missile crushes ray like an invisible fist. the second splashes glasse against the wall like an insect. reflexively stillwell reaches out for watts. wraps himself around her protectively. the blow lands an instant later. stillwell and watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a staggering impact. watts is dazed: stillwell killed. woozy, she sees the sleeper step into the pilot chamber. the door begins to close. watts sees that david's head lies just inside the door. she scrambles for it. too late. the door knits itself into a featureless wall before her reaching hand. watts is alone.}
