<L>__{exterior marsh day}
<A>__{claude and ray beat the bullrushes with switches. amid a flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. wilkins fires first, knocking one out the sky. pike pulls off two rounds, playing clean up.}
<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{ray and claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup truck. nearby, pike drains his flask while wilkins scrapes mud off his boots. the breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{well, that's a pretty good haul. what do you say, mr. pike? ready to call it a day?}
<A>__{pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the face plate. a familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering breeze. ray turns around slowly. his eyes fall on the watch in pike's hand. his daddy's watch. in pike's hand.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, it's getting late. i could sure use a bath.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's a real nice watch you got there, sir. fancy old thing even plays a little tune.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, it's special. they don't make 'em like this anymore.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sure don't. mind if i ask where you got it?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.}
<A>__{claude looks at the watch, then at ray. uh oh.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{must have been some time ago. maybe forty years?}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{something like that, yes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{she give you that scar, too?}
<A>__{pike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under ray's chin.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{like you shot winston hancock?}
<A>__{wilkins turns to see pike holding ray at gunpointerior}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's mr. uppity nigger to you.}
<A>__{ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into pike's face. pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel of his own gun now in ray's hands. confused, wilkins points his gun at ray.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{cool it, ray. you're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{he's right, gibson. put down the gun and we'll work this out.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{shoot him, wilkins!}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't shoot, sir. i can deal with this.}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. see, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. and it's not that i like you or anything, but i've kinda gotten used to having you around.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he's got my daddy's watch, claude. i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock. and that was you, mr. pike.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{he's crazy. don't listen to him, wilkins.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{do you realize what your saying, gibson?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. it meant the world to me.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{goddamn it, wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he shoots me, i swear i will take you with me! i just want to hear you say it.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{is there any truth to what he's saying, pike?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{what difference does it make? natchez was better off without winston hancock! who cares if a couple of no account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? at least the state of mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{forty years of cheap labor! gimme that gun.}
<A>__{claude grabs for the gun.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no, i'm gonna kill him }
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, believe me, i'm gonna kill him!}
<A>__{claude yanks the gun free and points it right in pike's face. wilkins trains his gun on claude. but the moment passes. claude lowers the gun. bewildered, wilkins does the same.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's because you're soft. gimme the gun.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i said you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't call me soft, i hate it when you call me that.}
<A>__{ray mouths the word "soft." claude clenches his jaw, points the gun and pulls the trigger. click. pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot. but as he raises it blam! pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast. shocked, ray and claude look at wilkins, his gun still smoking in his hands. after a significant beat, ray reaches down and gingerly retrieves his daddy's gold pocket watch.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i believe this is mine.}
