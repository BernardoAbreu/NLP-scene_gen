<L>__{exterior roof top continuous}
<A>__{fleury finds a table with a view. tabletop: holes and finger paint stains. al ghazi three feet away. both look in the same direction: two tigers being held back. fleury's studying the housing compound through a video camera, comparing the images on his camera with what he saw posted on the internet.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{you've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet? al ghazi yes.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{look for yourself.}
<A>__{al ghazi takes the camera from fleury. he lines up the same shots we saw posted on leavitt's computer: clearly a match. this is where they shot the video}
<D>__{al ghazi he was here...}
<A>__{another long moment. al ghazi looks at the table, discarded trash: the capri sun containers, the candy wrappers.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{formed the plan up here: saw everything he could hit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{way too pretty a' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit. he came here a couple times.}
<A>__{al ghazi quiet for a long while. then he reciprocates:}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi the man who did this is a saudi this place, this neighborhood... if foreigners were up here, someone would say something.}
<A>__{fleury looks over to the two dozen locals peering out with suspicion at them on the rooftop.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{i see. colonel al ghazi nobody's talking. here, many people love hamza they think of him like bin laden. like your robin hood.}
<A>__{fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. al ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at fleury:}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{a man who thinks of something like this ...while maybe his family played around him... scares me more than i have words to express. shaytan...}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<P>__{(refocusing)}
<D>__{two big answers in two small minutes. imagine if we had a couple days together.}
<A>__{al ghazi pauses.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{i'm sure the general is good guy...and i'm just as sure he's no investigator.}
<A>__{al ghazi stands still, silent. fleury reaches into his pocket. reveals the detonator to al ghazi. al ghazi reaches to take it. fleury holds it for a beat...}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{let me help you.}
<A>__{he hands the detonator to al ghazi. al ghazi now pockets it.}
<B>__{a beat...}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi we break now: too hot to work outdoors. then we will leave for the palace.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{and i imagine that will run until sundown? colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime.}
<A>__{fleury just nods back.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{miss mayes will not attend this evening. men only.}
<A>__{fleury looks over to janet. hurt, yet extremely defiant, she looks ready to attack anything that comes near her.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{you want to tell her that?}
