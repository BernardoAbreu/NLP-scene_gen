<A>__{they are both lying in their beds. anne sleeps, breathing noisily. georges lies with his eyes open, listening attentively to her breathing.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the sun shines in. georges has cooked something simple. they are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{... some banal romance or other about a nobleman and a lower middle class girl who couldn't have each other and who then, out of sheer magnanimity, decide to renounce their love in fact i don't quite remember it any more. in any case, afterwards i was thoroughly distraught, and it took me a bit of time to calm down. in the courtyard of the house where grandma lived, there was a young guy at the window who asked me where i'd been. he was a couple of years older than me, a braggart who of course really impressed me. "to the movies", i said, because i was proud that my grandma had given me the money to go all alone to the cinema.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{"what did you see?" i started to tell him the story of the movie, and as i did, all the emotion came back. i didn't want to cry in front of the boy, but it was impossible; there i was, crying out loud in the courtyard, and i told him the whole drama to the bitter end.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{so? how did he react?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no idea. he probably found it amusing. i don't remember. i don't remember the film either. but i remember the feeling. that i was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when i was actually watching the film, and that i just couldn't stop.}
<A>__{she looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that's cute. why didn't you ever tell me before?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{there are still a few stories you don't know.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{aha...? don't tell me you're going to ruin your image in your old age?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you bet i won't. but what is my image?}
<A>__{she takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. then she looks at him.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{sometimes you're a rotter. but you're nice.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(embarrassed grin)}
<D>__{can i take you for a drink?}
<A>__{she laughs.}
