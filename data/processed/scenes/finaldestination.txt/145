<L>__{extremely wide across the tracks}
<A>__{the train clears frame and is gone... revealing, across the tracks, alex, clear and carter can do nothing but watch billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<A>__{for a beat, there is silence... until, in the distance, sirens can be heard, approaching. as alex stands and carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from billy's body.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to carter)}
<D>__{you should have been nexterior after lewton, you should've been nexterior that's the only pattern. you should be dead.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you're the fuckin' devil.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to clear)}
<D>__{but i saved him. i intervened. just like the plane. that's the design.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{police are coming.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's why it skipped carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; billy.}
<A>__{alex looks at clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{my intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{"intervention?" what are you, god now?!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{of course not! gods aren't afraid to die! gods don't die! we do!}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{you're losin' it. the police will be here. we have to go to the cabin. you can hide there. get your head together.}
<A>__{alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{after billy... it's me. and then you.}
<A>__{clear grabs clear and touches her face.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(to clear)}
<D>__{hey, i won't let it happen, okay.}
<A>__{carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{then, get out of here.}
<A>__{as she moves to alex, clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to carter. she takes alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods. in the distance, a train whistle blows, eerie, as if death was punctuating the moment.}
