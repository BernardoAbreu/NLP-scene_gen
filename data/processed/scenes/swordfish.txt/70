<L>__{interior gabriel's living room night}
<A>__{stanley and gabriel stand in gabriel's primo designed pad, staring at an array of supercomputers. stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels, linked together, in complete awe.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{pretty impressive, huh.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so...}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{here's the deal. i need a worm, stanley. a hydra, actually. a multi headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what kind of cypher?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{vernam encryption.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{a vernam's impossible. its key code is destroyed upon implementation. not to mention being a true 128 bit encryption.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{actually, we're talking 512 bit.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{tell ya what, i will pay you ten million dollars. that should be enough to get your daughter back...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... unless of course it's impossible.}
<A>__{stan thinks about it.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{nothing's impossible.}
<A>__{they shake hands and gabriel heads toward the back of the house. long shot gabriel walking up the stairs toward his room. stan looks over to see ginger staring at him.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{ginger pulls herself up on the desk, spreading her legs on either side of the keyboard.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{c'mon, stan. let's get to work.}
<A>__{she turns on the computers. he backs away.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{it won't bite you, i promise.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i don't know. it's gonna be pretty hard without a gun to my head.}
<A>__{she reaches out and pulls him to her.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{well, let's put a gun to your head.}
<A>__{she kisses him and slowly he responds. she smiles.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{tell me about your worm, stanley.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{you surprised that a girl with real breasts and an i.q. over 70 can give you a hard on?}
<A>__{stan shakes his head.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i thought you were gabriel's.}
<A>__{she looks at him a moment. she smiles at him and slowly bends forward to whisper in his ear. closeup ginger's mouth at stanley's ear.}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(very slowly)}
<D>__{i am not what you think i am.}
<B>__{angle on ginger and stanley}
<A>__{as she leans back. she stares at him a moment then slides off the desk.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{you're a smart guy, stanley. you figure me out.}
<A>__{she hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been drinking, and then grabbing stan by the belt buckle, pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house.}
