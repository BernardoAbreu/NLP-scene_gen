<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(to the bookkeeper, quietly)}
<D>__{the general accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in stans' safe. did you know about that from the beginning?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<P>__{(about to fold)}
<D>__{there are too many people watching me they know i know a lot }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{a lot of it was. i just thought it was sort of an all purpose political fund you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<P>__{(her words are coming faster)}
<D>__{i can't be positive that it was used for the break in but people sure are worried.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{which people?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{the ones who could disburse the money.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{who were they?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{there were a group of them i think five, i don't know their names.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{sloan knew which five, didn't he?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<C>__{bookkeeper's sister}
<P>__{(back with cream and sugar)}
<D>__{here we are.}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{i don't want to say anymore.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(indicating coffee)}
<D>__{it's awfully hot }
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{ and you haven't finished telling me about the money }
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<P>__{(long pause; then in a burst)}
<D>__{ omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two day period six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. i thought it was all legal, i guess i did, til after the break in, when i remembered gordon got so much of it.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(heart starting to pound)}
<D>__{gordon liddy, you mean?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it was all so crazy the day after the break in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his gordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everything don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. you just know that when gordon liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.}
<P>__{(more and more moved now)}
<D>__{...it's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all i care about is hugh sloan. his wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. and he quit. he quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{think sloan's being set up as a fall guy for john mitchell? sometimes it looks that way.}
<A>__{there is a pause. then }
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{if you guys... if you guys could just get john mitchell... that would be beautiful...}
<A>__{and now, as long last, she begins to cry. hold on her tears, then }
