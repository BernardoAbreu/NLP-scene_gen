<D>__{if god would choose a plant to represent him, i think he would choose of all plants the cactus. this one plant has all the blessings he tried but failed to give man. it is true. look. the cactus is humble but not submissive. it grows where no other plant will grow. the sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. not a complainterior in good times or bad it will still flower. it protects itself from danger.}

<D>__{but it harms no other plant. it has patience and solitude and modesty. in mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night. that is saintliness of the highest order i think. ja? from cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of god or stare into the mouth of hell. it is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness. modesty, beauty. toughness and gentleness. of all the plants i think it is closest to god. ja?}
