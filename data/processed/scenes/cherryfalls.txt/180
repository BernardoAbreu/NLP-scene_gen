<L>__{exterior lisa sherman's house}
<A>__{it's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'for sale' sign stands crookedly in the front yard. brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty tools and old auto parts.}
<L>__{exterior front door}
<A>__{brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. he can't. he walks around in a circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face lisa sherman after all these years. he draws the gun from his holster and knocks. no one answers. he knocks again. no one answers, again. a woman, the caretaker, appears from the side of the house.}

<D>__{i can.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{i knew lisa sherman long ago. it's extremely important that i get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{i don't give a fuck what your reasons are. you pay me ten dollars, you can go inside otherwise, get a warrant.}
