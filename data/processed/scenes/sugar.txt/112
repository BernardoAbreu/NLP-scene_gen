<L>__{interior anne's house minutes later}
<A>__{some kind of casual teenage party is in effect. pizza boxes are spread around the living room and everyone (12 15 white kids) are drinking soda from plastic cups. no booze.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{hey everybody, this is miguel. he's from the dominican republic, and now he pitches for the swing.}
<A>__{everyone manages to say "hi miguel" at the same time. game room a little later two guys, randy and travis, play a spirited game of foozeball, while miguel looks on, fascinated.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what's up, man?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{wanna play?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{no. thank you.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{it's like soccer. you play soccer?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{soccer? no. baseball.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well this is called fooze ball. fooze ball.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{foos ball?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{yeah, you got it.}
<A>__{miguel looks for anne, sees her going over some papers with another kid. she sees miguel, waves, then gets back to her conversation.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i used to be a pitcher. in little league. i wasn't very good though.}
<A>__{miguel nods, and another girl, wendy, chimes in.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i heard that the beaches in the dominican republic are really beautiful.}
<A>__{miguel nods again. they stand in silence for an awkward beat, sipping from their red, plastic cups, until...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{hey guys, let's get started. everyone grab a seat.}
<A>__{the teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. miguel sits behind the majority of the group, not sure what's going on. anne stands before them...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm so glad you all came. last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group. so, i think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word. but this year, i want us to work harder. now, i know a lot of you are studying for sats or working on college applications. and all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important. what we do in school or for a job... that's just a small part of who we are. we're only here by the grace of god, so let's get out there and share that grace.}
<A>__{miguel watches, still unsure what's going on. living room a little later anne leads the group in song, while randy plays the piano. miguel watches; he's the only person not singing.}
<C>__{the group}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{one there is above all others, oh, how he loves! his is love beyond a brother's, oh, how he loves! earthly friends may fail or leave us, one day soothe, the next day grieve us; but this friend will ne'er deceive us: oh, how he loves!}
<A>__{miguel observes, a little disappointed, as this is not quite the date he was hoping for.}
