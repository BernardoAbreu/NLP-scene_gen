<C>__{principal claire}
<D>__{ya!!}
<A>__{claire lands on her feet, triumphant. even chun is amazed, as he turns his head, shane spins, and grabs the rocket launcher. close up shane he breaks into a big grin. close up claire she proudly smiles back at him. angle the cute cop he's flummoxed. this chaos is unsolvable. beaten, he reaches for his radio.}
