<DIAL>__{Written by Dan Pyne Current Revisions by Glenn Gers January 6, 2005}
<ACTION>__{CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors. THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt. Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange. He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device. His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball - - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg- style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles - - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table. Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball. He stays still, analyzing. He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal- working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint. Drops in another ball. It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down. Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine. Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid-30s. His wife.}

<ACTION>__{JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm - - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish. They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls off her - slowly coming back to earth. Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face - - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear. She is, after all, having an affair.}
<LOC>__{INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless. He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands, removing the glasses. We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip. Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom. He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk. He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card. He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby. Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal. TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(Doesn't look up)}
<DIAL>__{Yep.}
<ACTION>__{She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle. Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and grabbing his jacket - - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk, liquor spilling. Crawford just walks out past Tina.}
<LOC>__{INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER}
<ACTION>__{The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor. N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site. They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this is not a man who skips a shave. But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:}
<CHAR>__{CRAWFORD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's here.}
<ACTION>__{He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield. His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford doesn't slow or look back.}

<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him. He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor. He is silent.   Very still.}

<ACTION>__{Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late-afternoon light. She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home. Across the street, MR.

In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings. Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and - - freezes, startled. Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer "disarray", he is calm and focused.}

<LOC>__{INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove. He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way to Jennifer. He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open. The doorbell rings.}

Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace and throws them into the flames. They curl and blacken. Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around, satisfied. Waiting.}

<ACTION>__{Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved back to a block away. UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck. ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an L.A.P.D. Detective.}

<CHAR>__{NUNALLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay then.   Here we go.}
<ACTION>__{He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt, concealed under the jacket. He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house. The spectators fall silent.    Radios crackle and hiss as he heads up the driveway.}

<DIAL>__{Then you can "pay more attention" to what I'm saying.}
<ACTION>__{Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room.}
<CHAR>__{CRAWFORD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Happy ending, then.}
<ACTION>__{Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster. Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns - - and step away.   Crawford smiles. Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.}

WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College. He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside.

<ACTION>__{Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor - - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc - - that misses the bowl. Outside, the police car doors open and then slam. Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee-table and across the floor toward him. Crawford doesn't move.     Trying to focus.    His mind working. The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe. The doorbell rings. Crawford looks up.     Meeting Willy's eyes. Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air. And gives Crawford a wink. Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes - - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.}
