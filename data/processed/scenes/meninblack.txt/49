<L>__{interior mib building headquarters day}
<A>__{ slide open on men in black headquarters.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{as of this moment, they don't mean much.}
<A>__{it's unlike anything we've ever seen huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. the workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both humans and aliens. most of the aliens stay in the background, like the upside down guy who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers. kay and edwards step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place. kay leads him down into the complex. first, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human bureaucrat at a desk is checking the documents of a line of aliens who've just arrived. there are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, chatting in half a dozen different alien tongues. edwards slows as they pass, listening to the passport control officer as he addresses an arquillian, a large, humanoid visitor.}
<C>__{passport officer}
<D>__{purpose of trip?}
<C>__{arquillian}
<D>__{diplomatic mission.}
<C>__{passport officer}
<D>__{duration of stay?}
<C>__{arquillian}
<D>__{lunch.}
<C>__{passport officer}
<D>__{carrying any fruits or vegetables?}
<A>__{edwards just stares, fascinated, but kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{let's go. he's a little...grouchy.}
<A>__{kay moves him into the central hall.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{a couple of hours wait after a 17 light year flight would get on anybody's nerves.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{what branch of the government do we report to?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{none. they started asking too many questions.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{so who pays for all this?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out of state visitors. velcro. microwave ovens. liposuction.}
<A>__{at a storage cage, kay turns a key in the lock of a caged in area and throws the door open. inside, there are piles of sophisticated looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(picking something up)}
<D>__{here. a new recording device to replace cd's. so now i gotta buy the white album again?}
<P>__{(something else)}
<D>__{this is amusing. universal translator.}
<A>__{he holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{we're not supposed to have it. i will tell you why. human thought is so primitive it's considered an infectious disease. makes you proud, doesn't it?}
<A>__{edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{don't touch that!}
<A>__{the ball zings out of edwards' hands it flies out into the main complex hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can follow various shots of humans and aliens ducking, dodging, and jumping out of its way. on kay as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd looking metal glove over his right hand... he raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it kay catches the ball, calmly.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{caused the '77 new york blackout. practical joke by the great attractor. he thought it was funny as hell.}
<A>__{they leave the room.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{sorry!}
<A>__{on the main floor, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{observation, the heart of our little endeavor.}
<A>__{the screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{this map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time. some of them we keep under constant surveillance.}
<A>__{he hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of boxes, each with smaller video images.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{everyone on these screens is an alien. in public normal. in private you'll get the idea.}
<A>__{on the screens, we see live images of aliens. aliens who look alien are in spots where they can't be seen. aliens who look human are functioning right out in public including sam donaldson. michael jackson. and tony}
<B>__{robbins.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{meet the twins.}
<A>__{kay gestures to two small, bony creatures with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. they turn around and wave two or three arms each.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{i gotta be honest about something.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{it makes no sense?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{it makes perfect sense. when i was a third grader in philadelphia, they told me i was crazy 'cause i swore that our teacher was from, like, venus or something.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mrs. edelson.}
<A>__{edwards, stunned, looks at kay as 4 eyes boots her onto the screen: mean face, cat glasses. bony fingers. extremely well hidden tail.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.}
<A>__{with their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous console. zed, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to edwards, sizing him up.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what's your jacket size, edwards?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{uh forty regular.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{then let's put it on.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{put what on?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{the last suit you'll ever wear.}
