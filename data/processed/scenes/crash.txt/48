<L>__{interior seagrave apt. night}
<A>__{the seagrave apartment is dirty and depressing, featuring cheap, cigarette scarred leatherette furniture. james watches helen and vaughan steer seagrave into the living room, where two people sit on a couch watching television with the sound turned off: gabrielle, a sharp faced young woman who is rolling a hash joint; and seagrave's wife, vera, a handsome, restless woman of about thirty. vera stands as they come in and rushes over to the shaky seagrave.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{oh, god. what happened? here, lie down.}
<A>__{vera and helen lay the confused seagrave down on the three seat sofa, while vaughan sits next to gabrielle and helps her prepare another hash jointerior james, awkwardly left standing, notices long scars on vera's thighs and legs.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they did the james dean crash. it seemed to go perfectly. but he started to feel nauseous on the way back. i'm sure it's concussion.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{ah, well... we're familiar enough with that, then, aren't we?}
<A>__{james watches gabrielle and vaughan. as she rolls a small piece of resin in a twist of silver foil, vaughan brings a brass lighter out of his hip pocket. gabrielle cooks the resin, and shakes the powder into the open cigarette waiting in the roller machine on her lap. on gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps. she notices james staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her legs. on the sofa beside her is a chromium metal cane and, as she shifts her weight, james sees that the instep of each leg is held in the steel clamp of a surgical support. it now becomes obvious from the over rigid posture of her waist that she is also wearing a back brace of some kind. gabrielle rolls another cigarette out of the machine, but does not offer it to james. instead, vaughan gets up and takes it over to seagrave, who has managed to sit up.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{i'd really like to work out the details of the jayne mansfield crash with you. we could do the decapitation her head embedded in the windshield and the little dead dog thing as well. you know, the chihuahuas in the back seat. i've got it figured out.}
<A>__{seagrave takes the lit joint and draws heavily on it. he holds the smoke in his lungs for a while, studies the grease on his hands before he answers.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you know i will be ready, vaughan. but i will want to wear really big tits out to here so the crowd can see them get cut up and crushed on the dashboard.}
<A>__{james turns to go, leaving helen to her conversation with vera, but vaughan follows him through the door, holding his arm in a powerful grip.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{don't leave yet, ballard. i want you to help me.}
