<L>__{interior elias's house kitchen early morning}
<A>__{through sliders we see a small pool. elias and hull sit over uneaten omelets. both still shaken by the previous scene.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{eddie, man... he was always nice to my daughter.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{how'd a guy like you get into this?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{the way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and i had to move it. soon i was doing more dealing than law. but this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{yeah. and now...?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{the road gets rougher. cocaine's a dying business.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{then what are we doing here?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{people are always going to want to get high. every society has ways to alter consciousness.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{because they can't bear reality.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{we all need our delusions, only the means change: psychedelics, opiates, prayer, orgies, human sacrifice...}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{what's next?}
<A>__{elias puts a finger to his lips.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why aren't you selling it?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i know how to make it and market it. but i need capital. that's the only reason i'm hanging out with an asshole like barbosa.}
<P>__{(feels his hatred of barbosa)}
<D>__{and because i can't get to the big guys.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{who are the big guys?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{gallegos, et cetera.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(reacts to the name)}
<D>__{why can't you get to them?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{what do you care?}
<A>__{hull shrugs: he doesn't.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anyway, designer drugs have a bad name: ice, ecstasy, tar there's a limited market for parkinson's disease. but what about completely safe, almost legal, terrific shit you can go to work on and do your job better than you ever did it straight?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{sounds like a dream.}
<A>__{they hear someone coming.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(closing the subject)}
<D>__{in dreams begin responsibilities.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{tell me about this new shit.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{some other time, john, when we know each other better.}
<P>__{(as miranda enters kitchen)}
<D>__{hey, bunnela.}
<P>__{(she snuggles against him; elias enjoys it)}
<D>__{five times two.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{it's too early. don't bother me.}
<A>__{he hugs her, kisses her, much more openly affectionate than hull was with his own children. hull notices that.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(continuing; head in her father's chest)}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{elias whispers in her ear.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, yeah... ten... who's he?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{that's my friend, john. this is miranda.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{hi, miranda.}
<A>__{miranda gives hull a shy greeting. nancy hurries into the kitchen, handsome, busy, ready for work.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{come on, honey...}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{nancy, this is john.}
<A>__{nancy nods briefly in hull's direction. elias kisses miranda who grabs the back pack her mother proffers, and they go out. when they're gone:}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing; on nancy's chilliness)}
<D>__{that's not about you. it's, she's... judgmental about what i do.}
<A>__{when they're gone, he opens louvered doors onto a washer dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to hull. hull looks inside. white powder. he tastes. real. he hefts the bag.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{that's more than i bought.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{half we owe you. the other half's on consignment. a token of our esteem.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{you're having trouble moving it.}
<A>__{elias doesn't deny it.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{make me your partner. i will help you get your capital.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i don't need a partner. i need a salesman.}
