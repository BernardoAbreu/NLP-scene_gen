<ACTION>__{Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic, minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of... ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can just make out... ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see... The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb- ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt. Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible? CLOSER still to see... ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision, until... ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the}

<ACTION>__{in a cavernous coldly-decorated space. Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and the window... ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind, and the Thief slips... ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its}

The beeping, the green light, go OFF.  The device is removed. Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction- mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling window pane.  A small remote control clicker... ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled}

<ACTION>__{pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place. No trace of entry. Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle, the Thief SCANS... ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix, Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon. The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin- drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE, we enter... ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper- plated commode, and across from these... ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master. A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously... ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes. Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube, pulling out... ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this, fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame. Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor. Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube. Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement canvas... A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown. WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL. The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps... ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating, and... Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place.}
<LOC>__{INT. VENT}
<ACTION>__{Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the narrow space, arriving at... ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100 floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly, the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from the backpack, and simply... LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an instant... ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place, suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the Thief... ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL, until a cord is tugged and... ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...}

<ACTION>__{Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE ANGLE now to see in far distance... ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on... ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit window to see... ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP to... VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the Tower, to... The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta. Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off... We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it... Closes.  Softly.}

<ACTION>__{A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the hurried side of brisk. HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches. Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering... NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle below the words.  He holds his hand up to it... Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...}
<LOC>__{INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum- ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into a seamless array of IMAGES... Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila- tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv- idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed. The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room. The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live. We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo. Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty. Except one.}

It is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously.

<DIAL>__{Planning.}
<ACTION>__{She WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And dumb luck.}
<ACTION>__{She COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm, sobbing...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God, I hate you.}
<ACTION>__{He holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head.}
<CHAR>__{MAC } <CHAR_PAR>__{(softly)}
<DIAL>__{Good.  I hate you, too.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING}
<ACTION>__{WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead... ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag, leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular. As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear his conversation...}
<CHAR>__{MAC } <CHAR_PAR>__{(into phone)}
<DIAL>__{...if I can't have my usual suite, I'll take my business to the Bristol, simple as that.}
<ACTION>__{He sees her now.  Smiles small.}
<CHAR>__{MAC } <CHAR_PAR>__{(into phone)}
<DIAL>__{...why indeed should I be more loyal to you than you've been to me?  Think it over.}
<ACTION>__{SNAPS the phone shut.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You ran your calls.}
<ACTION>__{She did.  She is frankly exhilarated.}
<DIAL>__{GIN All the transactions, all the transfers.  It's a miracle.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why?  The CD erased the trans- actions, all accounts seem in order.  It looks like the thieves were stopped in time.}
<ACTION>__{She sighs.  It is a miracle.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Colonel says police have nothing.  A man in black-tie, a blonde in a gown.  The elevator guards saw faces, but no mug shots to ID.  I think it's over.}
<ACTION>__{Mac's smile.  Bittersweet affection.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Except it never is, really. Quite.  Over.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol, huh?  In...Paris?}
<ACTION>__{Ah.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're not going back to Mr. Cruz, and the nine-to-five?}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not hardly.  I've arranged to be killed in a car crash.  On Taipei. Amazing how little it costs.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well.  You want to watch those pennies.}
<ACTION>__{She takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I could arrange for two.  In that crash.}
<ACTION>__{His smile back. He looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway steps.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, for a bitch.  You can be awfully sweet.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Woman of mystery.  What do you say? I like the Bristol, just fine. mean, it's not the Ritz...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, all night I've been wrestling with something...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not the most flattering way to put it.}
<ACTION>__{He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've changed your travel plans.}
<ACTION>__{They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mine.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?}
<ACTION>__{Got that?}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line.  Like a wire transfer, you're gone.  Vanished.}
<ACTION>__{He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In this bag are passports, tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a good one.  A dress you can slip on in five seconds.}
<ACTION>__{Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this?}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're on a tight connection to the Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mac, wh...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shhh.  You always talk too much.}
<ACTION>__{They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles, now.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Time has come to return the favor. One last time.}
<ACTION>__{Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in.}
<ACTION>__{And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole thing.}
<CHAR>__{GIN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(hushed)}
<DIAL>__{My God.  You're a cop.}
<CHAR>__{MAC } <CHAR_PAR>__{(very softly)}
<DIAL>__{That's my girl.}
<ACTION>__{Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the world.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See, my profession was cover, too.  A notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans...}
<ACTION>__{He sighs.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've turned in...well, couple hundred.  over forty years. Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...}
<ACTION>__{Looking around the tunnel.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thought I might retire.  After you.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And all the...microchips, the diamond machine...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, the chips were returned. The machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real?}
<ACTION>__{Glances at her.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought...everything was real. Stupid girl.}
<ACTION>__{End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless quai.  Trains in transit.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Those were your jobs, so I could have claimed entrapment.  You had to wait.  For mine.}
<ACTION>__{Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Oracle Bone...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, the State Department liked that one.  They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan.}
<ACTION>__{He sighs.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So they're taking credit for letting it go through.  Tho I'm afraid your Colonel may be in for a career disappointment.}
<ACTION>__{She stops walking.  She has to know...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And the 5 billion.}
<ACTION>__{Ah.  That.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I haven't told them.}
<ACTION>__{Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform. Walking slower now.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I said you hadn't revealed the job.  That it wouldn't take place until after the changeover.}
<ACTION>__{Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't look, they're there.}
<ACTION>__{Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well.  Kept my options open.  If I give you up, they don't matter, do they?}
<ACTION>__{Her heart pounding through her chest.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One was retirement.  With four billion dollars.  After all, I know some places where life could be private...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you couldn't do that, huh?}
<ACTION>__{They've stopped.  Just two travellers in a strange land.  waiting for a train.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.}
<ACTION>__{He nods.  Smiling pleasantly.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Creature of habit.  I suppose.}
<ACTION>__{We feel her adrenaline racing.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Keep smiling.  They won't move, until I raise my left arm.}
<ACTION>__{And so she smiles.  As prettily as she can manage.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought.  Well, I've got the CD. I could contact the banks, reverse all the transactions...}
<ACTION>__{A train is COMING.  We HEAR it.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...except maybe.  Leave you with... oh, a hundred million, say.  To tide you over.}
<ACTION>__{SEE the train.  Slowing.  Pulling in.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.}
<ACTION>__{With a SHRIEK of metal.  The train PULLS toward us.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I figured.  What the hell?}
<ACTION>__{What the hell?}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let her keep the lot.}
<ACTION>__{The train STOPS.  The doors OPEN.  People come out, people go in. Pouring around them.  They are alone again.  The subway doors stand open.  Two feet away.  She looks at them...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No rush.  The doors won't close for 60 seconds.}
<ACTION>__{Sixty seconds.  And still smiling...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point it at my temple.}
<ACTION>__{She freezes to stone.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can do it.  If I say you can.}
<ACTION>__{And she...DOES IT.  A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head, Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we... WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close. They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO... Two people. Alone in the universe.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on my face.}
<ACTION>__{She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming, cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands raised...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seems I was wrong.}
<ACTION>__{Gentle smile.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Entrapment.  Is what robbers. Do to cops, huh?}
<ACTION>__{Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down.}
<ACTION>__{Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oughta shoot you in the face.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, you can do it, if I sa...}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No way.  Not anymore.}
<ACTION>__{She sobs.  She can't stand this.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ten seconds, hold on.}
<CHAR>__{GIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{When do I see you?}
<ACTION>__{There is no answer.  There are no words. The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents, and the train... PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a tunnel.  Gone. Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly... Still staring after the train.}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Airport.  Changing at Mongkok Station, we can cut her off.}
<ACTION>__{Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over. We begin to CRANE UP...}
<CHAR>__{MAC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She might lose the wig, be looking brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...}
<CHAR>__{AGENT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think Yaumatei changes for the airport, and it's closer.}
<ACTION>__{Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...}
<CHAR>__{MAC } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{I think you're wrong, but cover it. You got maybe four minutes.}
<ACTION>__{HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{MAC (O.S., calmly)}
<DIAL>__{No problem.  She's trapped.}
<ACTION>__{But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man... Staring after.  What has gone.}
<TRANS>__{FADE TO BLACK:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{.  ROLL END CREDITS.}
