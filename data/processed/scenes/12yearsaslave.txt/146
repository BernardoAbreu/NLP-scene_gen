<L>__{exterior epps's plantation later}
<A>__{epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. he looks up only to see patsey returning to the plantation. epps steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief. as they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry. treach is near as well.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{run off. run off, did you?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{massa epps }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you miserable wench! where you been?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{i been nowhere.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{lies to your misdeeds!}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{the sabbath day, massa. i took me a walk to commune wit da lord.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{bring the lord into yer deceptions? yah godless... shaw's. comin' from shaw's plantation weren't yah?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{...no...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yah took yerself ta pleasure shaw. yah gave baser passion to that unblushin' libertine!}
<A>__{solomon tries to intervene:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{master epps }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{now yah speak? now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find yer tongue.}
<A>__{epps goes to strike solomon, but patsey pulls his arm back.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{do not strike him. i went to massa shaw's plantation!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yah admit it.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{freely. and you know why.}
<A>__{patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress.}
<C>__{patsey }
<D>__{i got this from mistress shaw. mistress epps won't even grant me no soap ta clean with. stink so much i make myself gag. five hundred pounds 'a cotton day in, day out. more than any man here. and 'fo that i will be clean; that all i ax. dis here what i went to shaw's 'fo.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you lie...}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{the lord knows that's all.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you lie!}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{and you blind wit yer own covetousness. i don't lie, massa. if you kill me, i will stick ta that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i will learn you to go to shaw's. treach, go get some line}
<A>__{treach runs quickly to the tool shed. in short order he returns with the rope in hand.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{strip her. strike her bare 'n lash her to the post.}
<A>__{mistress epps has now come from the great house. she gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction. now tied to the post, epps stands behind patsey with his whip.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{yah done this to yerself, pats!}
<A>__{epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no matter his rage, epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow. he looks to mistress epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{do it! strike the life from her.}
<A>__{epps again hoists the whip. it trembles in his hand ahead of the act... but he does not have it in him to deliver such a beating. turning to solomon, thrusting the whip at him:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{beat her.}
<A>__{solomon doesn't move. epps shoves the whip into his hand.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{give her the whip. give it all to her!}
<A>__{patsey, begging to solomon:}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{i'd rather it you, platt.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{strike her, or yah'll get the same!}
<A>__{solomon takes a step back. he unfurls the whip... he begins to whip patsey. lash after lash, patsey squirms before it. epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too distraught to watch. but the mistress... she is not satisfied with solomon's half hearted effort.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{he pantomimes. there ain't barely a welt on her. that's what your niggers make of yah; a fool fer the takin'.}
<A>__{epps's grief is replaced by fury. epps grabs the pistol from treach's holster and draws down on the slaves.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yah will strike her. yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or i will kill every nigger in my sight!}
<A>__{solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life. but from the ground, from patsey:}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{do it, platt. don't stop until i am dead.}
<A>__{what else can he do? solomon begins to whip, to truly whip patsey. her back welts, then tears... patsey screams in agony. solomon strikes again and again... after a full thirty lashes solomon looks to epps, who is not satisfied.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{until i say no more! i ain't said nothing!}
<A>__{solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. by now, as promised, patsey's back has been reduced to little more}
<B>__{than torn meat and blood.}
<A>__{finally, solomon holds low the whip. he can and will do no more.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{strike her! strike her!}
<A>__{solomon will not. epps takes up the whip and whips patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. the painfully loud and angry curses of epps load the air. patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed. the lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground. at length patsey ceases struggling. her head sinks listlessly on the ground. her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan. it would seem that she was dying. solomon, screaming at epps:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{thou devil! sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin!}
<A>__{though epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved pats.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no sin! there is no sin! a man does how he pleases with his property. at the moment, platt, i am of great pleasure. you be goddamn careful i don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further.}
<A>__{by contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight. the birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress. peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere. everywhere else. epps leaves patsey to herself. he says not a word to the mistress as he passes. the mistress herself heads back into the house. solomon unties patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin.}
