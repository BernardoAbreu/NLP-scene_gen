<D>__{...what about the roadblocks?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i will go through the woods.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{don't you suppose there'll be cops in the woods.}

<A>__{lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time, and nina speaks out, unable to let him leave.}

<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you said "we." what about your two scenes?}
