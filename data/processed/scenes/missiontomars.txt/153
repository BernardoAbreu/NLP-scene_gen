<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. it's mars.}
<B>__{suddenly a huge asteroid}
<A>__{tumbles through space towards the planet...}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{on the planet closer view as thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface, heading in a stream out of the solar system...}
<B>__{the asteroid impacts}
<A>__{and a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. oceans boil and vaporize. two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the planet, spinning in flames... mcconnell, luke, and terri involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...}
<B>__{the planet is now dead}
<A>__{as dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. the flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.}
<B>__{the astronauts}
<A>__{stare at this devastation, deeply moved.}
<B>__{in deep space}
<A>__{the stream of martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system. then we zero in on}
<B>__{one particular rocketship}
<A>__{as it peels off and goes in another direction. graphics show a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix of dna. the ship heads towards another blue planet in our solar system...}
<B>__{earth}
<A>__{as it was then. more clouds than now, more ocean, and the landforms all wedged together.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{her voice is soft.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{earth, when it was still pangaea. before the continents separated.}
<B>__{the lone martian ship}
<A>__{makes a fiery streak through earth's atmosphere and plunges into the ocean. instantly the image of the dna double helix grows, filling the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new images... mcconnell, luke, and terri cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as}
<B>__{living forms}
<A>__{flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, crawling, leaping, flying: one celled microscopic organisms, plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, birds, small mammals, larger mammals the entire stunning panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck}
<B>__{faces of the astronauts}
<A>__{until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, colored rings on the floor. the astronauts are left staring at each other across the open space where the column had been.}
<B>__{the martian}
<A>__{now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their circle, taking the fourth position. mcconnell is opposite her glowing form, and terri and luke are at either side. the martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. as they do so, the martian seems to be staring directly into mcconnell's eyes.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. it's the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve. staring at the martian, he understands.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{they're us. we're them...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we're martians...?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that's what she means.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{oh my god. the cambrian explosion.}
<A>__{mcconnell and luke look at her.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{almost six hundred million years ago, there was a sudden expansion of life on earth. the first multi celled plants and animals appeared. no one has ever understood why...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{they seeded earth.}
<A>__{we hear a bell like tone, a single lingering high note, and simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor begins to glow brightly. it is an intense chromium yellow.}
<B>__{the astronauts}
<A>__{step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the circle of colored rings. these shade from yellow, on the outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally reds. inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue, about a meter across. small points of light glitter here, like stars against a midnight sky.}
<B>__{the martian}
<A>__{steps closer to mcconnell. she has picked him out in particular. now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{looks back at her, nods his understanding. for the first time she seems to smile. benevolence, reassurance. then as abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. vanishes. luke and terri look at mcconnell, confused. there is a sudden, static filled crackle from their helmets, nearby on the floor.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{...in, please. can you... me?}
<A>__{terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{phil, we're here! we read you.}
<A>__{even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the relief in phil's voice. and then the desperation.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{thank god! listen, this storm is really }
<P>__{(loud static)}
<D>__{ few more minutes, i can't }
<P>__{(more static)}
<D>__{you've gotta get back to the ship!}
<A>__{and then they hear only static. his signal is lost.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{phil? phil...?}
<A>__{suddenly the bell like tone repeats, at a lower register, with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as}
<B>__{the first orange band}
<A>__{begins to glow brighter. mcconnell turns, looking at this new color, then looks back at luke and terri.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{we are in a ship. this is a ship. and the countdown has already started.}
<A>__{terri looks at luke, alarmed.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{he's right.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{then let's get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{she scoops up luke's helmet, tosses it to him. as he catches it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they came from, and luke follows her. until they both become aware that mcconnell isn't with them. they turn back. he's still rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jim...}
<A>__{mcconnell doesn't turn.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jim, we gotta go.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i'm not coming with you.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{coming back, she sees how calm he is. how certain.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we've got to get home.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that's where i'm going. don't you see? that's what all this is for.}
<P>__{(mcconnell gestures}
<D>__{at the ship around}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{you were right terri. this is an invitation. to follow them. to follow them home.}
<A>__{he looks into their faces. terri is trying to grasp this idea, still incredulous. luke has the beginning of a half smile.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i have to go. this is the mission now. to find out who we are. isn't that why we came here? like maggie said, "to stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one."}
<A>__{luke nods at the memory of maggie's words. terri remembers too. mcconnell's passionate conviction is affecting them both.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{you know, when you think about it i wasn't even supposed to be here all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just... it's just... i just know it's right.}
<A>__{terri looks at luke. luke is smiling. he understands.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i'm okay. i know what i'm doing. but you're running out of time. you've gotta get back to the erv and get off this planet. now please go.}
<A>__{luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i once felt like i was taking your turn. but now i think maybe you're taking mine. guess i'm a little jealous.}
<A>__{they clasp hands for a moment. but in this moment is a lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks for saving my life.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{luke nods, deeply moved. he turns away, picking up his helmet, as terri comes closer, looking at mcconnell, a long unspoken beat. her eyes are glistening.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i wish woody were here to see this. he would've wanted to go too, jim.}
<A>__{terri smiles. she is starting on the road to recovery. she's going to be okay.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{he's here, terri. we wouldn't have made it without him.}
<A>__{terri nods. she digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls something out. she hands it to mcconnell, and his fist closes around it.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{take care, jim.}
<A>__{mcconnell smiles. terri smiles back at him. then she turns, picks up her helmet, and crosses to where luke has paused, looking back.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, jim...?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{have a great ride.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{always do.}
<A>__{luke and terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, then hurry away, into the darkness.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{looks down at what terri gave him. it's woody's neck chain with the little flash gordon rocketship.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{grips this tightly as he looks up.}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
