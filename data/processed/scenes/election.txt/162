<A>__{at the foot of the main walk to the school, tracy and her mother are setting up a card table covered with little pink cakes. jim's ford escort chugs its way through the fog and comes to a stop. looking like a war refugee, jim emerges from his car carrying the gym bag and heads toward school.}

<D>__{good morning, mr. m.}
<A>__{jim stops, turns slowly, regards mother and daughter with a crazed, one eyed, uncomprehending stare.}
<C>__{tracy }
<P>__{(holding one out)}
<D>__{looks like you could use a cupcake!}
<A>__{jim takes it wordlessly. as he heads up the walkway, he eats it in two huge bites, like a feral animal.}
<C>__{tracy }
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{what's wrong with your eye? are you ok?}
