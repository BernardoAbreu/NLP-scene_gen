<L>__{interior frank's office continuous}
<A>__{they walk into an office filled with photos of frank in his fighting days. he was obviously somebody. the walls are also adorned with sparta posters. frank reaches into a mini fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of vitamin water. he hands one to brendan and motions for him to sit down.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you look good, brother. how're the girls?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{good. good. i had another little one. rosie.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i know. johnny c. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. i was gonna call, but then time went by. i don't know. i'm a piece of shit. i should have called.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, brendan. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it's all good. she's good now.}
<A>__{frank looks at his old friend. smiles warmly.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's great to see you, man. so everything's going good?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah. well, i've got a little problem. the guys at the bank want to take my house away. that's kind of why i came to see you, actually.}
<A>__{frank considers what he's hearing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i didn't come here for a loan, frank.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was hoping you'd train me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{train you for what?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i want to get back in the cage.}
<A>__{frank starts smiling. leans back in his seat. then he sees brendan is not smiling with him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're serious?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i just won an event the other night.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ah, you won an event.}
<P>__{(off bruised face)}
<D>__{that's what this is. let me guess, it was in a parking lot. dj from the local radio station. couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. am i right?}
<A>__{brendan smiles.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{ish.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ish. brendan. i love you. i do. but why would i train you? when you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. you never listened to me. you never listened to anyone. these guys are animals. i mean, you're a teacher, right? what're you gonna do? you're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? you're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i've got loads of time. time's not an issue. the parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. i need to keep working the smokers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{tess know about this?}
<P>__{(off brendan's nod)}
<D>__{yeah? `cause the last time you fought, i got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. you remember that?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no. i was unconscious.}
<A>__{the two friends share a laugh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at frank?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it's not gonna happen. come on. whattya say, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do i say? what am i gonna say to you? no? i mean, all my time is wrapped up with marco. you come down, i will throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. but i can't promise you much more than that, brendan.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's all i need.}
<A>__{brendan stands up. shakes frank's hand.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{i appreciate it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{let me know when you're coming down.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{well, i'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{now?}
<A>__{brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as frank shakes his head.}
