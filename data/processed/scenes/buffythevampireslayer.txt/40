<A>__{perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind pike and benny as they continue to walk home. they're really bombed now. they are somewhere in the hills now, and they come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley. a waist high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth. they stand below a thick, green tree.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i will have it running in a week. it's be beauty. it just needs new shocks, you know, break pads, an engine, and some wheels. it'll be totally cherry.}
<A>__{pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the bottle over the side. there is a moment before they hear it shatter.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{when you get your car together, man, let's bail.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you think? split?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{utterly. let's bail this town. it's getting... i don't know. let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{our own world, where we could live and grow beans. hundreds of beans.}
<A>__{benny wavers, catches hold of pike.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna ralf.}
<A>__{he leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{don't worry, benny. i'm here for you.}
<A>__{pike falls over backwards.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm here for you, ralf.}
<A>__{pike passes out. closeup benny still waiting to throw up. the figure approaches slowly from behind him. the figure is a few feet away from him when a hand shoots down from above and grabs benny's face. angle in the tree amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls benny up to face him. amilyn has changed his manner of dress drastically. he wears a motorcycle jacket and sunglasses. his hair is punked out. benny is in shock, as amilyn holds him easily by his shirt collar.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{you wanna go for a ride?}
<A>__{amilyn leans back all the way back, falling back out of the tree and pulling benny with him. we see them fall out past the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it. it is merrick, the man from the mall. he runs to the side of the wall, looks over. the two are already lost in the dark mist. merrick turns around, looks about him. he digs in his pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly. while digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on the railing. stake and cross in hand, he stands by pike looking out at the night. angle the picture it is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her birthday cake. the cake reads, "happy birthday, buffy".}
