<L>__{interior hospital emergency room night}
<A>__{a doctor, comforting molly, accompanies her from one of the emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of swinging doors into a separate waiting area. we see two policemen and two detectives stand up and approach her. sam doesn't want molly to go and begins to follow her, but then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. he turns back just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it. a wrinkled old man approaches sam and joins him on the bench. he begins talking.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{so, what happened to you?}
<A>__{sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you're new, huh? i can tell.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you talking to me?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{relax. it ain't like before, you know. it's a whole new ball a wax.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i'm waiting for my wife. she's in 4c. cardiac wing. she's fighting it.}
<A>__{the man sticks his head into the green sheet covering sam's body. his head disappears. sam is terrified.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{shot, huh? that'll do it every time. poor bastard. well, get used to it. you could be here a long time.}
<P>__{(leaning in close)}
<D>__{i will tell you a secret. doors ain't as bad as you think. zip zap. they ain't nothin' at all. you'll see. you'll catch on.}
<A>__{suddenly there is a loud commotion and we see several physicians operating furiously on an old man lying on the table beside them. it is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he ain't gonna make it. i've seen it a million times. he's a goner. see? here they come. lucky bastard. could have been the other ones. you never know.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{before sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light. suddenly he looks up and freezes. the amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table. they are emitting a powerful light.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hurry, we're losing him.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what'd i tell you? bingo!}
<A>__{the glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help extract it from his body. his physical form changes instantly from a solid object into an ethereal substance. sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit upward. they evaporate through the ceiling.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he's gone.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the light in the room grows dull instantly. nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. sam turns to the old man.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you? what's happening...?}
<A>__{the man isn't there. an orderly approaches the gurney with sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. sam jumps in front of him.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no!}
