<A>__{deserted. no sign of human life. everything trembles with the force of a major earthquake. the wildebeest arrive. destroying the village. grass huts are flattened. the enormous stone oven collapses. crumbling to pieces. scraggy's model t is overturned. with nothing left standing, the wildebeest move on. the village has been completely devastated. surrounded with a heavy cloud of dust. camera pans to the graveyard. grave markers and tombstones lie broken and crushed. countless hoofprints cover the flat ground. the dust begins to settle. the graveyard ground suddenly buckles. moving. a hand shoots out. indiana climbs out of the dirt. he is followed by the others, who also climb out from underground. everyone is unhurt. safe. protected by the ground above. a skeleton has attached itself to betsy. refusing to let go. scraggy, indy and a few of the men run to the overturned model t taxi. they grab hold of the car and turn it back upright. clare looks at the devastated village. betsy stands beside her, struggling to escape from the clutches of the skeleton. clare looks into the distance. watching the departing wildebeest. she is troubled.}
