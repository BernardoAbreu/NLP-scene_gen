<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{jane leaning against the garden wall, trying to think, trying to compose herself. the sun is setting.}
<L>__{interior night. moor house the parlour.}
<A>__{jane carrying a candle, opens the door. st john is at the table working by lamp light. the moon shines brightly in.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men. maybe god is giving me this. and what is there for me here? pain and longing for what can't be. i don't know how long i would survive in india. my frame isn't strong. but i will go with you, if i may go free.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{free?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you and i had better not marry.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{because i am your sister.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{but you'll go with me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{conditionally as your curate.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{jane, i don't need a curate; i need a wife.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i must have my heart and mind free, my own self to turn to. i couldn't become part of you }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{a part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void. how can i, a man not yet thirty take out to india a girl of nineteen, unless she is my wife? don't offer god half a sacrifice. he must have all. and undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union right, even in your eyes.}
<A>__{jane is shocked.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{enough of love?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{yes, quite enough.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{st john, i scorn your idea of love. i scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and i scorn you when you offer it!}
<A>__{st john is mortified. a slow rage begins to boil in him.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i've uttered nothing that deserves scorn.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. my dear cousin, please abandon your scheme of marriage.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{no; and if you reject it, it's not me you deny but god.}
<A>__{jane is stung. st john has turned from her. his face is icy in the moonlight.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do not be angry with me please. it makes me wretched. i want us to be friends.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{we are friends. i hope we can be more.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i cannot come as your wife.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{why this refusal? it makes no sense!}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{if i were to marry you, you'd kill me. you're killing me now.}
<C>__{st john}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{i'd kill you? i am killing you? your words are violent, unfeminine and untrue }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you'd kill me without drawing any blood or receiving on your conscience any stain of crime.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{what nonsense is this?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you'd experience no pain but i tell you it would kill me!}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{because i would inevitably come to conceive love for you, because you are so talented and good, because there is such grandeur in your look. you wouldn't want this strange and torturing love; if i showed it you would find it unbecoming. and my lot would be wretched.}
<C>__{st john}
<P>__{(understanding her)}
<D>__{jane...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you're a good man, but you forget the feelings of little people. we'd better keep out of your way lest you trample us.}
<A>__{st john's anger has faded. he is compassionate. this is far harder to resist.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i wouldn't trample you. you'd walk at my side towards god's altar. he'd be your solace, heaven your reward. we seek to do the greatest work, to open death's gates, to save souls. love god jane, love god.}
<A>__{st john puts his hand on her forehead; christlike. jane is falling under his power.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{give up your heart to him. he is love.}
<A>__{jane falls to her knees. st john's face is angelic.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{if i were sure; if i were certain }
<A>__{she suddenly hears a voice: rochester's; clear, urgent.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{jane! jane! jane!}
<A>__{she springs away from st john, crying:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh god, what is it?}
<A>__{she looks wildly about the room; rushes to the window.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{what have you heard? what can you see?}
<A>__{jane glances at him, seeing him for what he is; a cold, controlling man. she shouts:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am coming!}
<A>__{she runs out, leaving st john aghast, behind her.}
