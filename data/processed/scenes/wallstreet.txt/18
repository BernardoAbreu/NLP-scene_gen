<L>__{interior gekko offices outside reception area day}
<A>__{bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his watch. almost 12. he's lost some two hours of business. natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{five minutes...}
<A>__{bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.}

<A>__{he follows natalie.}
<L>__{interior gordon gekko's office (bud's pov) day}
<A>__{furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, modern art ranging from black field paintings by ad reinhardt to the smashed dishes of julian schnabel. nautilus equipment, hi tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid howard miller world time clock, and a world map... three of gekko's people, young mba's dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out. gordon gekko aka gekko the great as the media calls him, dressed in a custom english suit, paces on the phone with the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50 foot extension cord attached to his blinking 130 line silver plated telephone. on his ears is a headset. he is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from new york exchanges to london, commodities, gold, and currency values. a second secretary and sometimes natalie exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. gekko often shakes his head "no".}

<A>__{alex de betancourt, a tall handsome frenchman, jots a note and follows gordon over to line 3. gekko's dark intent eyes fixing briefly on bud who stands waiting in the corner. he motions him to sit.}

<P>__{(to alex)}
<A>__{bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the wall street journal commemorating gekko's successful deals; they hang like scalps from the walls. gekko's eyes drifting to bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center. a man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(line 4)}
<D>__{look harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. go slow. call geneva and the bahamas for me, will ya? we feint towards it but we wait...}

<P>__{(indicating cigars)}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(tries a smile, awkward)}
<D>__{...got a connection at the airport.}
<A>__{gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state of the art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and starts pumping it up. his aides continue on the phones.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{so what s on your mind kimosabe? why am i listening to you? got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh no, no...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(demonstrating it)}
<D>__{within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. has an lcd readout, and it's cost effective less than one visit to the doctor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i just want to let you know mr. gekko i read all about you at nyu business, and i think you're an incredible genius and i've always dreamed of only one thing to do business with a man like you...}

<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{so whatta you got for me, sport? why are you here?}
<A>__{bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of briefs. gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm. ollie, the big trader, ambles back in, says something to the third aide, a young intelligent looking woman susan turner.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{chart break out on this one here...uh whitewood young industries...low p.e. explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. great cash flow. coupla 5% holders. strong management.}

<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{mr. stevenson in san fransisco.}
<A>__{gekko takes the call, cutting bud off.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{he respond to the offer? what? what the hell's cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? i guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...well christmas is over and business is business.}
<P>__{(simultaneous to ollie)}

<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{sue get the lbo analysis on teldar paper and bring it here...what else?}
<A>__{bud shifting, uncomfortable as gekko finally swivels his attention back to him.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(coming right back)}
<D>__{tarafly...analysts don't like it. i do. the breakup value is twice the market price. the deal finances itself. sell off two divisions, keep...}
<A>__{aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with gekko who looks up at bud with the first sign of interest.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{not bad for a quant, but a dog with different fleas.}
<P>__{(checks his hi tech watch)}
<D>__{come on, tell me something i don't know. it's my birthday, pal, surprise me...}
<A>__{as he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the shredder that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. the sound it makes is soft and menacing. buddy knows its fourth down and long, gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. in frustration, bud blurts it out.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{bluestar airlines.}
<A>__{the camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him.}

<D>__{a comer. 80 medium body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, canada, some florida and caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{...don't like airlines, lousy unions...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{there was a crash last year. they just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. even the plaintiffs don't know.}
<A>__{gekko looks up, remotely interested.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(hesitates, concerned)}
<D>__{i know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. there's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. good for a five point pop.}
<A>__{ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.}
<C>__{ollie}
<D>__{... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1 4 from janson, think i will pull twice that at 18 1 2 outta the california pensions. we got close to half a million shares in the bag.}

<D>__{my home number's on the back...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(smiles, looks at card)}
<D>__{bud fox, i look at a hundred ideas a day. i choose one.}
<A>__{bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, hope to hear from you, sir.}
<A>__{he turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the revelation he has made passing susan who hurries in with a dossier. gekko glances at it. as bud leaves, he overhears:}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ok gang, looks like we're going over 5% in teldar, start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13d, we keep going after everything in sight but don't pay over $22. they're gonna fight, they got myers and thromberg doing their legal, they make nazis look like nice guys...}
