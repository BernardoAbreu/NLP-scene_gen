<L>__{exterior ward, icu, alpine grove, next morning}
<A>__{starks sits by a window i.v.'s in his arm smoking feebly, still severely weak from the jacket, while dr. lorenson observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i will die either way.}
<A>__{lorenson pulls up a chair and sits opposite him.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i can't try to help you unless you let me. [beat] i know about the jacket.}
<A>__{starks waits to see what this means.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i'm sorry for what you were put through, and i'm sorry i couldn't stop it earlier. but i promise you that i will from now on... starks [cutting him off] i don't want you to.}
<A>__{lorenson doesn't understand.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you have no idea what's going on.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{no, i do. that's what i'm saying to you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{listen to me! you don't! the jacket is my only chance in this place.}
<A>__{lorenson just thinks it's another delusion.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{how can you say that in your physical condition? do you realize that it's because you were put in it that you're as...weak as you are now? becker's a man who's not well himself.}
<A>__{starks searches for words that won't sound as crazy as he knows he appears. they don't exist.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you don't understand.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{then help me understand. you know, you're not alone. a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. what you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{this has nothing to do with that. lorenson [exasperated] then what? what? [beat] i can't guess it. you have to help me.}
<A>__{starks fixes his eyes on lorenson. he has nothing to lose but still he treads carefully. the words that follow come almost unwittingly.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{...what you do not know is the only thing you know.}
<C>__{starks }
<D>__{[beat] and what you own is what you do not own... and where you are is where you are not.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] where is that from?}
<A>__{it's as though starks hears his words for the first time.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't know. [frustrated] remember?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{come on. tell me what you do know.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] i've seen a time that's not this time. and i'm only able to see it when i'm in the jacket.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{well, what time is it?}
<C>__{starks}
<A>__{lorenson nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you don't believe me. lorenson [testing him] well, what year do you think it is now? starks [exasperated] i'm not delusional. i know it's 1992. same as every sane person.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{ok fine. tell me about it. tell me about the future. 2004. what does it look like?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{it doesn't look all that different.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{the future doesn't look different?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. not for people like me. [beat] not in the places i come from.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{what about the world?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't see that much of it same as now. i only saw it as part of my own life.}
<A>__{lorenson looks at starks, unintentionally patronizing.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{do you think you're traveling in time? is that it?}
<A>__{starks shakes his head and momentarily challenges lorenson simply with his air of calm resolve.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{not everyone in here is crazy, doc.}
<A>__{lorenson searches for another approach.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] like who? like mackenzie maybe?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{maybe. lorenson [matter of factly] did he tell you he tried to kill his wife?}
<A>__{starks nods.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{mackenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here. all because his wife left him for another man.}
<A>__{starks moves to put his cigarette out and his i.v. almost falls out of his arm. lorenson makes a move to adjust it and starks flinches perceptibly, startling lorenson.}
<D>__{starks [adjusting it himself] maybe that just makes him weak, not crazy. or maybe he is crazy. [beat] still doesn't make me think i am. starks [adjusting it himself] and, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think i am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{why don't you help me?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{because i don't have time.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm about to die unless i do something to stop it.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{and how do you know that?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{because of the future. i know what's going to happen.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{william, that is just another facet of my delusions.}
<A>__{then, starks remembers the only thing that might help him. he pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{and what about your work with eugene the kid? is that another facet of my delusions?}
<A>__{lorenson having prepared to continue is bowled over at the mention of her patient. she loses all color and calm in her features.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{how do you know about eugene?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you told me about him. i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him. so you told me.}
<A>__{lorenson doesn't know what to say.}
<D>__{lorenson [somewhat angrily] how do you know about eugene!? starks [shaking his head in disbelief] you told me. it's like two parts of you talking through me. look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way i could know about him.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{there obviously is, so what don't you just tell me how you found out about him.}
<A>__{starks looks at her convincingly.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{some part of you suspects even if you don't know for sure that what i'm saying is true.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i don't know how you know about eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no! they're not my delusions! look, just leave my business with becker to me!}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{one thing's got nothing to do with the other.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{one's got everything to do with the other. so unless you want my blood on your hands...leave what's between me and becker between me and becker.}
<A>__{lorenson backs off, jarred by starks' assertions and fearful of his debilitating vehemence.}
