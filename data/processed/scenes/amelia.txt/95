<C>__{george}
<D>__{boy, that is the last thing i'd want.}
<A>__{well, then?}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i only thought that if you're serious about this around the world nonsense. it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.}
<C>__{amelia}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{...$36,000. after a generous discount from lockheed.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{may as well be a billion.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{...not to mention at least another 36 to get it modified and ready.}
<A>__{she glances at him. he looks awfully smug.}
<C>__{amelia}

<D>__{...oh, eighty grand. for a suitable ‘flying laboratory.’}
<A>__{her eyes just bug out. no! he nods, slowly. uh huh. and she... ...throws her arms around his neck, kissing him hard enough to startle passersby. it only makes him chuckle.}

<D>__{by the way. that's not the surprise.}
<A>__{it's not? uh uh. and he glances to... ...the window of the gallery they've stopped at. she sees a magnificently carved chest. on a crest in the front: ae. we pan the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder... ...a small cat. in a long frock coat.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{merry christmas.}
<A>__{her tears just come. she's standing on park avenue and she can't do anything about it. he reaches a tender hand... ...and strokes her hair. he is her hero. see it in her eyes.}
