<A>__{it's after school. dade's just unlocking the front door, only to find a secret service agent behind it. and one behind him in the hallway. both point pistols at him.}
<C>__{agent ray}
<D>__{secret service!}
<C>__{agent bob}
<D>__{don't move!}

<C>__{dade}
<D>__{what are you doing, man? get off me!}
<A>__{they lead him into his room and throw him down on the bed. plague is there.}
<C>__{agent bob}
<A>__{just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see them.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{the year was 1988. and this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.}
<A>__{dade has a flashback.}

<C>__{plague}
<D>__{must have been hell, huh? zero cool?}
<P>__{(getting to the point)}
<D>__{a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system. you were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.}
<C>__{gill}
<D>__{however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{gill.}
<A>__{the three secret service agents leave plague and dade alone. plague shuts the door behind them.}
<C>__{plague}
<P>__{(of gill)}
<D>__{loser.}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{i can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. it's quite an impressive virus. dade, i know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. for us, there's no such thing as family and friends. we're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. i'd like to make a treaty with you.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i'm sorry. who are you?}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{i'm the one who understands you. now, can we be allies?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{nah. i don't play well with others.}
<A>__{plague is holding dade's baseball bat. he shrugs, turns around, and smashes dade's stereo to smithereens.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{shit! come on!}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{watch which friends you do play with. a record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. no future. exiled from everyone and everything you love.}
<A>__{plague replaces the baseball bat.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{i will be in touch.}
<A>__{plague leaves.}
<C>__{plague}
