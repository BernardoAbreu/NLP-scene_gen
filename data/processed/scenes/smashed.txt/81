<D>__{hey, i'm kate, alcoholic.}
<C>__{group}
<D>__{hi, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well...that is so not true! i had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. and i was adorable.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd piss my pants, but i was still cute.}
<A>__{people in the crowd laugh a little bit.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{when i first tried getting sober, i figured that as long as i didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. but it didn't.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my marriage fell apart. i got fired from my job. and that shit happened sober! i never read that in any pamphlet...}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{...that isn't what i signed up for.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{um...so, i relapsed. another shitty slogan i've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry you guys, but i hate those slogans. they all sound like bumper stickers. but, i have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when i drink...i become another person. and that person is a pretty big asshole. well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks then that person is awesome.}
<A>__{people knowingly laugh.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i wasn't happy being the "good time girl," though. and honestly, i wasn't very good at it.}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my life is really different than it was a year ago. i live alone. i'm bored a lot more. i have a job that pays a lot less.}

<D>__{i'm thankful for the program for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me.}
<A>__{kate glances at jenny and mr. davies.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{there are people that used to be a part of my life that i miss a lot but...}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{...i'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.}
