<L>__{interior jack's office moments later}
<A>__{jack, floyd gondolli and the colonel sitting.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{. . . so let's talk about the future. so let's talk about what video means to this industry and let's talk about how all of us not one of us but all of us will profit. i've been doing theater work in san francisco and san diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know you're history, floyd.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{no one's doubting your history or your credentials, floyd.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{then why the resistance? i mean: this industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then why help it?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{why not be prepared? the money comes from the colonel, the talent comes from you, jack. i've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids i got out there who are hot fuck action to the max. this is the future. video tape tells the truth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i have a stable of actors and actresses. they're professionals. they're not a bunch of fucking amateurs. they're proven box office and they get people}
<P>__{in theaters (where films should be seen)}
<D>__{and they know how to fuck well }
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{that's right, jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here. the video revolution is upon us and our role is critical. we have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that tell me about the future, tell me about video and amateurs and all that well lemme tell you something now: i will not shoot films on video and no i will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me. period.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{wait a minute, jack. i'm not a complicated man. i like cinema. in particular, i like to see fucking on film. i don't want to win an oscar and i don't want to re invent the wheel i enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth. that's me call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something i enjoy. one other small thing i want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business i'm not trying to hurt you. i'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're repeating ourselves now, floyd.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{jack, i think this is about cost and future }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the future is as bright as we make it it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape if it looks like shit and sounds like shit, it probably is shit }
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i think you're one gin past this conversation }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no . . . no. i'm crystal clear here.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{jack, please understand that this is not an argument . . . this is a fact of }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{. . . what . . . ?}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{this is not an argument, but a }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{what do you mean, jack, c'mon }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are you telling me that you're working with this shit?}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{i think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market jack: two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{true film fans won't watch that shit. it doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make sex look sexy.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{it doesn't have to look good, jack. film is just too damn expensive. the theaters are already planning converting to video projectors.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i haven't heard that.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{it's true.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we've got ten minutes until the new year and i don't want it to start like this so i'm leaving now. we will or we won't continue this conversation some other time.}
<A>__{jack leaves. floyd looks to the colonel. hold.}
