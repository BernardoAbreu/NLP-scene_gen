<L>__{interior stairwell, office building day}
<A>__{will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{...no, i'm here right now.}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{why are you acting so strange?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{because strange shit is going on. i will explain everything. just meet me where i texted you.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{will }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{please. just do it.}
<L>__{exterior roof, office building day}
<A>__{you can see the entire shitty town from up here. the access door opens and kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{will?}
<A>__{will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on the other side of the roof. kate starts toward him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{will takes out his cell phone and dials. kate's phone rings. she answers it, confused.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{we stay on will. we can see kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over will's cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just don't come any closer.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{why not? what's going on?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation, so please be cool.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{will, i swear, if this is }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i wish i was joking, but i'm not. i know it's a lot to swallow, but you gotta take it on face value, because there's a timer attached to this thing and it's counting down.}
<A>__{kate's voice falters }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh my god, will...we'll get help. i will get you help.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i didn't come here for help. i'm taking care of it. i came here because, should things not work out today as i would like them to, i want you to know why i was doing the things i did.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{please, just let me call someone. let me do something. this is crazy!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't disagree with you. it's fucking nuts. but that's not even what this is about.}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you, me and chet, with chet cut out of it?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{will, i can't remember about some stupid picture while you're }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i need you to remember about the picture, and about how i stop by your office every friday, and how i've always hated all your boyfriends, and how the two girls i've ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you see where i'm going with this? i love you kate. i have for a very long time.}
<A>__{kate is barely holding it together.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{will, this is a lot you're putting on me! you just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me. what the fuck is going on?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{a whole lot of shit. i'm sorry to do this to you, but i was afraid i'd never get the chance to tell you. and i know you have feelings for me, too. maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or if the world fucking hates me a brother.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{but what i hope is that you don't really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you'll realize it's the same way i feel for you. does that make any sense?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes. i mean, i've known you forever. it's not an easy thing to figure out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't need an answer now. just think about it. and no matter what you decide, you're too good for assholes like mark and the rest of them.}
<A>__{kate manages a small, stifled laugh.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay. i will process all of this. it's just, the bomb }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's distracting. i know. anyway, i'd love to stay and talk some more, but i can't. i gotta ask you to leave now, because i'm running out of time.}
<A>__{kate nods. will hangs up the phone. she turns back toward the access door, stops. she yells across the roof at will }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{if i had time to think about it...i'd probably tell you that i've always felt very strongly for you. and i've never thought of you as a brother.}
<A>__{will smiles, yells back }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's a huge relief. don't say anything else. i just really don't want to die now.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{try not to. please.}
<A>__{kate turns and continues to the access door.}
