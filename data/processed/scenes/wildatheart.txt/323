<A>__{dearest sailor darling, the first thing youll want to know is im keeping the baby. mama wasnt for it in the beginning but i think shes looking forward to it. im gonna name it pace no matter if its a boy or a girl. pace ripley sounds good, dont it? its kind of hard to believe that pace will be six years old when you get out. i feel like im kind of in prison too, but i know in six months, itll be over and ill have a son or daughter to show for it. our child!! i love you sailor. i dont know how much or what it means though i miss you an awful bunch sometimes i know youre thinking about me cause i can feel it. i miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. mama married santos. it just about drove me crazy. my daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending it like there is no tomorrow. im going to move out as soon as i can. mama and santos said because of the baby theyre lookin at the two of us in a different light whatever that means. johnnie farragut has plumb disappeared. no one knows where. i miss him, but not near as much as i miss you. time dont really fly honey does it? love, your lula p.s. i miss dancing...}
