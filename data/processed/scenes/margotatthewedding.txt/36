<A>__{claude's pov through the window: dick and margot in the back seat of the volvo. malcolm and pauline the front. the ignition turns. claude leaves the window. we hear the car rumble away. claude and ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of them. maisy is cross legged on wizard's dog bed and chews a stalk of celery.}
