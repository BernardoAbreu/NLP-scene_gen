<L>__{exterior san diego sports arena backstage ramp night}
<A>__{the kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel backstage arena door. he rings the buzzer. the door wheezes open to reveal the keeper of the san diego sports arena's backstage list. famous to all those who attempt to enter, this is scotty. he is a wiry, humorless man for whom powerlessness is the theme of his life except for those few hours he controls the list. scotty is only forty but everything about him screams that he's an angry sixty.}

<D>__{hi. i'm william miller and i'm here from creem magazine to interview the band black sabbath.}
<A>__{scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and snaps through three clipboard pages. he moves back to the door and grabs the handle.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{not on the list.}
<A>__{he shuts the door with finality. the kid stands silently for a moment. he looks over his shoulder, at two chattering groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp. they look at him sympathetically, but he turns away. william rings the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of creem from his bag. the door opens.}

<D>__{sir, i'm a journalist, and here's a copy of the magazine.}

<A>__{go to the}
<D>__{top of the ramp with the girls!}
<A>__{slam. william stands there for a moment. unsure of what to do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp. rejected by him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest. bracing himself, william rings again. the door opens slowly this time. scotty stands peering at him.}
