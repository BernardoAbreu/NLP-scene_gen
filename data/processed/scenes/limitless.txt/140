<A>__{lindy races down the hill, pushing past the line of people, and onto the ice... tan coat is clearly desperate he doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her. in a flash, he's on the ice after lindy, running and sliding. people collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending them sprawling... just as he's closing in on lindy... lindy wheels around, grabs a six year old girl under the arms, and hoists her into the air, swinging her legs at tan coat as hard she can! the little girl's skates arc through the air whoosh! and connect, cutting tan coat's face. badly. he sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood. people scream and scatter. lindy keeps her wits about her. she runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with surprising grace. she's gone.}
