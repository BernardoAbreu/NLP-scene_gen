<L>__{exterior deserted alley day}
<A>__{two bad arabs come running down the alley with the basket between them. suddenly, indy's whip flashes out sending both arabs and the basket tumbling. indy steps into view, his .45 trained on the sprawled arabs, and looks at the basket. the top has come flying off and the contents have clattered onto the cobblestone: inside is not marion, but a load of contraband pistols, rifles and ammo. indy is advancing on the trembling bad arabs with an ugly look when suddenly he hears marion scream around the corner.}
