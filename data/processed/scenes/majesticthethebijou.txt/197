<L>__{interior pete's apartment (l.a.) day}
<A>__{the door opens, revealing the super, followed by a sullen pete, carrying his suitcases and hat. he sets them down and goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.}
<C>__{super}
<P>__{(handing him a key)}
<D>__{here's a new key for ya. that mr. kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month. you got one swell friend there.}
<A>__{the super moves to the door and turns back.}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{good to have you back, pete.}
<A>__{he exits as pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin toy fire truck. distractedly, pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thanks...}
<A>__{he sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat. as he does, adele's copy of the constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor. pete picks it up and absently turns it over and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye: to delly,}
<B>__{the girl with all the answers.}
<A>__{love, luke pete closes the book. he thinks for a moment, then glances over at the phone. he picks it up and dials "0."}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{western union, please.}
