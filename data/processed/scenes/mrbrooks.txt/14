<L>__{interior bungalow n night}
<A>__{mr. brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. there's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. mr. brooks's feet glide out of the pantry. now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. move up; the person in the black slacks is marshall. in the middle of the kitchen, the sound is now recognizable. it's the moans of a couple fucking. this disturbs mr. brooks, he hesitates. marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. i want to see what they're doing.}
<A>__{mr. brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. entering a hallway, he reaches into his jacket. when his hand reappears it's inside a ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. he brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the ziplock against his wrist. the two men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. behind it the sounds of the love making are becoming more intense. mr. brooks nudges the door with his foot. it opens enough for he and marshall to see the couple inside. the man and woman from the arthur murray dance class are naked on the bed. as much as mr. brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. he can now hear his heart beating in his ears. he begins to breathe in unison with the couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. when the couple climaxes, when they come, mr. brooks's face goes blank. on the bed the woman rolls off her partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. behind them mr. brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the room. they don't know he's there until he speaks.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{both the man and woman jump with surprise and look. the woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what the fuck?!}
<A>__{then he sees the gun.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey, man, don't...}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{be quiet and sit up.}
<A>__{in an attempt to get away, the woman pushes herself back against the wall. she can't take her eyes off mr. brooks and she can't stop screaming. pop! a hole appears above her left eye. the impact of mr. brooks's high velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. the screaming stops. the man opens his mouth and begins to shake. pop! the bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the girl. mr. brooks looks at what he's done. his nostrils flare at the scent of death. then he moves, he's got work to do. on his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.}
<C>__{marshall }
<P>__{(barks)}
<D>__{whoa, earl, what the fuck is this?!!}
<A>__{mr. brooks snaps a look. the curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the apartments in a four story building on the other side of an alley can see into this room. most of their windows are dark. and there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{these pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, earl. this is a big mistake for you, earl.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(going to the window)}
<D>__{almost like i want to get caught, huh, marshall?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{well, don't fucking do that. i don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed.}
