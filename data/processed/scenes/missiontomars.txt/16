<A>__{slide back, revealing the crew in eva suits, carrying gear. they walk over to... the four man rover the astronauts climb in through the hatch. the last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. we see cote and luke check their screens and press some buttons. luke puts the rover in drive. wider angle, pulling up and away as the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the mars one base camp. the main hab unit looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, inflated bubble greenhouse. there's also an oxygen still, propellant plant, and, on the other side, a couple hundred meters distant, the massive erv (earth return vehicle), which arrived as a separate, unmanned flight. rows of solar panels, arrayed on the ground, and an american flag on a thin pole, about man height, complete the scene.}
