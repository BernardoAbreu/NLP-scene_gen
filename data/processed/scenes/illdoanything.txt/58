<L>__{interior counting room night}
<A>__{where we discover the source of the sound. some twenty card counters on the floor riffling through stacks of cards with erasers. matt and nan stand in the doorway.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{don't worry. my daughter used to throw fits in supermarkets when we first moved here. it's all so perfectly normal. plus i know a great psychiatric children's group.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's what breaks your heart. jeannie's problem is that she's so down on herself.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{well, she's lucky to have a daddy who cares, believe me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't know if lucky's the word. i'm hoping she's asleep when i get home so i won't have to deal with her... i'm actually afraid of my own kid.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{oh, my. i've had exactly that feeling and never said it out loud. see, there are men who talk my language and i'm just cursed that i'm not attracted to them because they are so nice they remind me of myself.}
<A>__{matt laughs. in the b.g., the counting is completed.}
<C>__{group captain}
<D>__{excellents?}
<C>__{girl counter}
<D>__{seven.}
<C>__{group captain}
<D>__{very goods?}
<C>__{boy counter}
<C>__{group captain}
<D>__{fairs?}
<C>__{second boy card counter}
<C>__{group captain}
<D>__{poors?}
<C>__{second girl card counter}
<D>__{just a second...}
<P>__{(finishes counting)}
<A>__{the group captain notes the figure on a sheet, walks to the doorway and hands it to nan, who is still deep into conversation with matt. she begins walking back to the theater without looking at the sheet in her hand.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i felt terrible about the way i blew up at you when i first met you.}
<P>__{(before he can object)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{full shot theater area night burke and others waiting as matt and nan come to a stop some distance away.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i began taking anti depressants when we moved here from washington. i had some small reactions sleeping 14 hours, no libido, i gained 17 pounds in nine days that sort of thing. so they gave me pills to deal with the side effects. and then pills to deal with the side effects i was getting from those pills. all this besides the stuff the nutritionist was giving me. the combination formed some sort of potion so that i keep telling the truth. i don't have a choice. that's why i was so rude to you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{your doctor says this?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{oh, yes. he's excited, but only because he sees glory for himself in it... see, ordinarily i wouldn't say that about my doctor, but i can't help it, it's the truth. he's monitoring me for a while longer before writing it up for this medical journal...}
<A>__{cathy has joined them.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{burke's going crazy waiting for the score.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{coming.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{how are you, anyway?}
<A>__{matt shifts, figuring out his answer.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(a small laugh)}
<D>__{it's a tough one, huh? me too.}
<A>__{nan looks down at the score.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{oh, my. matt, i'd better drive him myself.}
<A>__{she starts for burke.}
<B>__{on burke and others}
<A>__{as nan arrives and hands the studio executives the score, burke looking over their shoulders.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i can fix this... get some narration written. . .}
<P>__{(turning to director)}
<D>__{you'll cut 30 minutes. it will come out like butter.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{we're only 77 minutes now...}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself)}
<D>__{...a 47 minute movie... no, that won't work...}
<C>__{female studio exec}
<D>__{i have to go. i have a nanny problem. priorities, right?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{thanks for the support.}
<A>__{she kisses his cheek and leaves. a beat of silence... burke turns to nan.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{can you help?}
<A>__{exactly the moment nan has been waiting for... she does have a valuable observation to offer at this dark moment.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{yes, i can.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{it's only a movie.}
<A>__{as burke looks at her from the depths of his pain and sees her confidently believing that she has imparted something of value, the movie's marquee lights go off giving us a:}
