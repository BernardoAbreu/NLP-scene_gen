<A>__{carnby leans up against the door, pushing it closed. aline fumbles for her building keys. there's a crash as the creature slams against the other side of the door. carnby strains to keep it closed. the door rattles as the creature crashes into it again. aline finds the right key. she gets it into the lock. suddenly, the creature punches a clawed hand right through the door. the hand is visible as it digs its claws into aline's arm. the claws cut deep gashes into her. she screams in pain. the impact knocks the key out of the lock. aline drops the keys as she clutches her arm. the creature's arm retracts out the hole in the door. it smashes into the door even harder, trying to break through. carnby strains against the door, trying to keep it closed.}

<A>__{aline grabs her keys. she finds the right key, jams the key in the lock, and turns the bolt. there's another crash at the door. but the lock holds.}
<C>__{carnby }
<D>__{is there any way out of here?}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{no! why didn't you ask me that before you pushed me in here?}
<A>__{there's another crash. carnby and aline back away from the door. the door starts to buckle from the impacts. carnby reloads his revolver. he has it ready. but then the crashing stops. aline and carnby listen. everything is quiet. the sound of helicopters can be faintly heard in the distance. carnby listens against the door.}
<C>__{aline }
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{carnby nods to her. aline unlocks the door.}
