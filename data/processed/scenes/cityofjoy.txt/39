<D>__{i remember the first time i saw you, on the day of our marriage. wearing a bright yellow turban. you asked me my name and you said, 'you are a very beautiful girl and i am wondering whether you will find me appealing.'}
<A>__{he strokes her tenderly in return... but now, overwhelmed with despair, she begins to weep.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she doesn't want to say it, doesn't want to wake the children.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{it's all right what?}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{i miss the village. there i could help.}
