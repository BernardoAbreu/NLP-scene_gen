<A>__{sirens wail. passersby stare slackjawed at the driverless batmobile as it tears down the street, passing, darting, dodging buses and cutting off taxis all with a squad of cop cars in hot pursuit.}

<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{brakes squeal. the batmobile stops one yard short of batman and vicki. a moment later batman is at the wheel. sirens build. lights flash. the cop cars are now visible behind them. batman floors the pedal; the batmobile's powerful afterburners kick in; and the hapless cops kill their sirens as batman zooms off into the night at 140 mph.}
