<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm going to st. rose, abby. and i'm taking you with me. i know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. i want to see it born somewhere safe. i have a right to that, abby. whether you like it or not.}
<A>__{abby walks away. the postman rests his head on his pack for a moment. heavy. the click of a gun causes the postman to lift his head and see luke standing there.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thought i recognized you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{general bethlehem said...}
<P>__{(raises the pistol)}

<D>__{i don't give a damn what that asshole said.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the general is a great man.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{the general is a fucking lunatic.}
<A>__{the postman steps forward. stops when the barrel of the pistol is right against his own chest.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you?}

<A>__{the postman turns to watch as ford starts out of camp.}
<C>__{the postman}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you don't understand, do you? you never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it.}
<A>__{luke stares back into the postman's eyes. a frozen beat.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you ready?}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{abby sits on her horse. she's witness to it all. luke is confused and ashamed. the postman mounts his horse and moves to abby's side.}
