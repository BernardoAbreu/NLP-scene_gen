<L>__{interior laura's office. day}
<A>__{a copy of cheryl's notes comes through on laura's fax machine. we hear her familiar limp as she comes over to collect them. she reads the notes with interest.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{we discussed his fantasies. they are mostly masochistic. cheryl (v.o.) (cont'd) again, the idea of being punished. he has never seen female genitalia before and seems quite frightened by the idea.}
<L>__{interior side chapel. day}
<A>__{mark and father brendan are in the little chapel.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm sorry to lay all this on you, father. my worry now is that it's never going to happen. i'm never going to have intercourse with cheryl, or any other woman. maybe intercourse would prove i was an adult. maybe i don't want to cross that line. maybe this was a bad idea.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{do you want to know what i think?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i'd forget the psychobabble. i grew up on a farm. it even takes the animals a few times to get it right. can i suggest you try and enjoy it more? don't worry about the technical stuff. you're a poet. be romantic.}
