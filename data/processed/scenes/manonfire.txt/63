<L>__{exterior ago's mexico city day}
<A>__{creasy waits in the street, stands by the mercedes. he checks his watch, looks around. the minutes do not pass quickly. he looks over as the restaurant door opens and lisa exits with jordan kalfus and his latin wife evelyn.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(sees him)}
<D>__{creasy!}
<P>__{(stepping over)}
<D>__{meet jordan and evelyn.}
<A>__{creasy nods. they study him with interest.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so you're the bodyguard?}
<P>__{(creasy nods again)}
<D>__{you used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune?}
<A>__{jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. creasy nods a final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{does he talk?}
<A>__{as lisa gives her a dirty look, evelyn whispers...}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he's sexy...}
<A>__{jordan looks in the direction creasy looks.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you see any danger out there?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{the fear's worse than the reality.}
<A>__{just a blankness from creasy.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would you take a bullet for your employer, for samuel?}
<A>__{a condescending smile as jordan awaits his answer.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i wasn't hired to guard mr. ramos.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{for pinta then?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jordan!}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{if something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. i have skills in that respect. pinta would benefit by the fact that... i'm a soldier.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what kind of an answer is that?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{the answer is the truth. the question is foolish.}
<A>__{lisa smiles at the answer, kisses jordan on the cheek.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. i promise not to let evelyn spend too much.}
<A>__{evelyn doesn't see it, but creasy does. jordan just lets his fingers trace the top of lisa's ass. as she and evelyn head for the car, creasy is there to open the door.}
<B>__{mercedes}
<A>__{creasy gets behind the wheel. pulls into traffic. as he goes, he checks the rear view mirror. jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away. something odd about it all.}
