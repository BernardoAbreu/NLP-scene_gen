<A>__{john walks past the lunchtime crowd, makes his way to the bar. grabs a stool two...seats away from...carl shepard. john orders a soda, glances over at shepard. their eyes meet. john holds his gaze. a slight nod...}

<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{a hot shot, huh?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nah, just working the job.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{i hear that.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the nightingale murders.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{no kiddin'?}
<C>__{john}

<C>__{john }
<D>__{the past is a funny thing. we've all got skeletons in the closet. you just never know when they're gonna pop up and bite you in the ass, carl.}
<A>__{john slips something on the bar, next to shepard. it is a crime scene photo of shepard's murdered mother. he reels back, totally losing his veil of composure. he is freaked.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. and i'm gonna steal your life away. you went down 30 years ago. you just don't know it yet.}
<A>__{and with that, john gets up, leaving shepard stunned.}
