<L>__{interior veronica's bedroom night}
<A>__{uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in, veronica's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mother's voice continues to filter through the door. it's all been a dream...........}
<C>__{mom }
<D>__{dinner! veronica! dinner!}
<A>__{veronica closes her eyes and holds her heart. she suddenly launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{dear diary, no one can stop j.d. not the f.b.i., the c.i.a., or the p.t.a. that is to say, no one but me. i know where j.d. is coming from and where he is heading. he's wrong, but i'm going to teach him what's right. i'm going to stop j.d....if it's the last thing i do.}
<A>__{veronica leans back in her chair, sweating. she reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette j.d. had given her eariler in the film. she puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer.}
