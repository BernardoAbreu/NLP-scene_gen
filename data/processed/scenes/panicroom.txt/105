<A>__{through the tube, the sleeping man sits up. raises a hand, trying to block the light, which keeps flashing on him. he gets up, out of bed. he comes to the window. in the panic room,}

<A>__{sarah keeps it up, flashing faster. through the tube, they see the man come all the way to his window. he leans against it, cups his hands so he can see better. the flashes continue, right on top of him now. clearly, the man is reading the flashes! he takes a steps back from the window gives them the finger and angrily yanks shut his drapes. a moment later, the light goes out and the room is black. in the panic room, meg and sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated. sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at the ceiling. meg puts a hand in her hair. it was a good idea.}
