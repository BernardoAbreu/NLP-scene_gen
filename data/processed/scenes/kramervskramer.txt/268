<D>__{ted, it's joanna. can you meet me in the lobby?... alone?}

<B>__{on the elevator doors}
<A>__{as they open, ted steps out, looks around.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window. joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. she looks up as ted approaches, a small smile on her face.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(abrupt)}
<D>__{okay, i'm here. now why did you}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{ted, do you love him?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{goddamnit, joanna. what the}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{ted, do you love him?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i love him too... i don't think i ever knew how much until now.}
<A>__{there is a long pause as she looks at ted, unable to speak. finally:}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(a deep breath, then:)}
<D>__{ted, when we got married it was because i was twenty seven years old and i thought i should get married and... when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby... and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{joanna, what the hell is}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{please... please don't stop me. this is the hardest thing i've ever had to do..}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{struck by the urgency in her voice.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{after i left... when i was in california, i began to think, what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child. it got to where i couldn't tell anybody about billy i couldn't stand that look in their faces when i said he wasn't living with me. finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved him... and i did... and i won. only... it was just another "should."}
<P>__{(she begins to break down)}
<D>__{...sitting in that courtroom. hearing everything you did, everything you went through... something happened. i guess it doesn't matter how much i love him, or how much you love him. i guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for billy. i don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... ted, i think billy should stay with you...}

<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{only can i still see him?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no more waiting in coffee shops... i promise.}
<A>__{joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob. ted puts his arms around her and holds her. they do not kiss. then, after a few moments she steps back.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(chin high)}
<D>__{okay... i think i will go talk to my son now.}
