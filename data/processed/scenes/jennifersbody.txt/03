<A>__{the freshly showered patients assemble for breakfast. they grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. needy selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line and sits down, alone.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{personally, i think they're trying to wear us out. keep us sluggish so there won't be an uprising. well, those j.v. tactics won't work against me. i'm a kicker. k i c k e r. it even says so on my chart.}
<A>__{we briefly cut to needy's chart, on some doctor's clipboard. we see her name: anita "needy" lesnicki and a few brief details about first degree murder and grandiose notions. beneath that, we see a triple highlighted warning in bright ink: kicker. a nutritionist with a clipboard approaches needy casually and eyes her breakfast plate.}
<C>__{nutritionist}
<D>__{just one toastem, huh?}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i like toastems.}
<C>__{nutritionist}
<D>__{that's good. but i'm not sure a toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. i'd recommend more complex carbohydrates...}
<A>__{needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden, powerful roundhouse kick to the nutritionist's face.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i'd recommend that you shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{the nutritionist is knocked off her feet as if she's been kicked by a far mightier creature than needy and collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. we see that the bone has snapped. the patients shriek. chaos. as needy is restrained by staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish. needy snorts up a killer loogie and hocks it at the prone nutritionist. the glob nails her in the eye. it takes four staff members to haul needy away as she hollers in protest. the nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her. she spits out a tooth.}
