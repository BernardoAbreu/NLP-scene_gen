<L>__{interior pamela's drawing room night}
<A>__{pamela sits at the table, as disney carries in a tray with a teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. these he places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{milk. the milk goes in first.}
<A>__{he attends to it.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i remember.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{and whiskey. i will have whiskey in mine.}
<A>__{disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. she takes it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.}
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh well, when in rome!}
<A>__{he pours a slug into his tea too.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you've come to change my mind. to beat me into submission.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no, i've come because you misjudge me.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{how do i misjudge you?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you look at me and you see some kind of hollywood king midas.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{you think i've built an empire and that i want to use your mary poppins as just another brick in my kingdom. you think i see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{and don't you?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{if that was all it was would i have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? i'd've have saved myself an ulcer!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure i did. you see, i think life disappoints you, mrs travers. i think it's done that a lot. maybe mary poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{mary poppins isn't real.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{oh, no, that's not true. she's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children adults too. she's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{well, where is she when i need her? hm? i open the door to mary poppins and who should be standing there but walt disney!}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{mrs travers, i am so sorry. i hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. but i let you down and in doing so, i've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been wracking my brains, trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and i }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you see, i have my own mr banks. mine had a moustache.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{ah! not true then that disney created man in his own image?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{but it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. walt takes mouthful of laced tea and coughs a little.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{ever been to kansas city, mrs travers? do you know missouri at all?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{can't say i do and as i have no plans to ever set foot on american soil again i'm afraid i never will.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{it's mighty cold there in the winters. bitter.}
<A>__{walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then gives in. his enthusiasm completely disappears and he's suddenly as ragged and as weary as pamela.}
<C>__{walt }
<P>__{(it pours out)}
<D>__{my dad, elias disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there. thousand papers. twice daily. morning and evening edition. elias, he was a tough businessman. a save a penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother roy. i was eight then eight years old.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like i said, those winters were harsh and old elias didn't believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{honestly, mrs travers, the snow would be up to here }
<A>__{he gestures to his knees.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{you'd push through it like wading through molasses.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{and the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces and sometimes i'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz i must've passed out for a moment i dunno. then school, too cold to figure out an equation. and back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. my mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{best be quick walt, best be quick or poppa's gonna show you the buckle end again boy.}
<A>__{walt smiles at pamela, sips his tea.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{now, i don't tell you all this to make you sad mrs travers, i don't. i love my life it's a miracle. and i loved my daddy, boy i loved him. but, there isn't a day goes by where i don't think of that little boy in the snow and old elias with his fist and strap and i'm just so tired i'm tired of remembering it that way. aren't you tired mrs travers? we all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story? let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's not the children she comes to save. it's their father.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's your father ?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{travers goff.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i don't know what you think you know about me walter }
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i }
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{mrs. travers. it's all about him isn't it? all of this. everything.}
<A>__{pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{forgiveness. it's what i learned from your books.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i don't need to forgive my father. he was a wonderful man.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no, you need to forgive helen goff. life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself.}
<A>__{pamela looks down at the table top.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{give her to me, mrs travers. trust me with your precious mary poppins. i won't disappoint you. i swear that every time a person goes into a movie house from leicester to st louis, they will see george banks being saved. they will love him and his kids, they will weep for his cares, and wring their hands when he loses his job. and when he flies that kite, oh! they will rejoice, they will sing. in every movie house, all over the world, in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come, george banks will be honoured. george banks will be redeemed. george banks and all he stands for will be saved. maybe not in life, but in imagination. because that's what we storytellers do. we restore order with imagination. we instill hope again and again and again. trust me, mrs travers. let me prove it to you. i give you my word.}
