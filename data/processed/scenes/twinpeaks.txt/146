<L>__{128. interior roadhouse night}
<A>__{lots of bikers and the usual gang. on stage a singer sings. as laura comes in she makes eye contact with jacques renault who is behind the bar. laura sits at a table. jacques nods to a couple of burly truckers who come over to laura with drinks. one of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine inside.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{let's go around the world, babe.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{this isn't going to get you to walla walla.}
<A>__{they all take a drink.}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{you do go all the way, don't you, little girl?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{sooner or later.}
<A>__{laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you willing to go all the way? huh? you wanna do it for me. all the way for me means all the way dead.}
<A>__{the trucker turns a couple of shades towards white. donna comes in just as a beautiful song of lost love begins. laura and donna see each other as the truckers toss down bourbons and beer chasers, laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_. donna just stares at her from the other side of the roadhouse.}
<B>__{after the song}
<A>__{donna stands and walks over to laura's table. she reaches down, picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{let's boogie.}
<C>__{trucker}
<P>__{(to donna)}
<D>__{you part of the deal?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(answering for her)}
<D>__{no, she isn't.}
<A>__{laura and donna stare at each other. for donna's benefit, laura turns and gives a big, juicy french kiss to one of the truckers.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(to the trucker)}
<D>__{what was your name again?}
<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{buck.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{buck, that was really nice.}
