<A>__{as the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area, several troopers move into the room. the walls are dank and grey. there is a dripping sound. all around lie remnants of human civilisation. baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture. and here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of corpses. they have been eaten away. most of them are still moving, their heads uninjured. two of the troopers retreat, revulsed. the sound of the gunfire and screaming can be heard from the hall. the big black man walks calmly into the room. roger watches him. he walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. tears roll down his cheeks. some of the creatures are without arms and legs. some have been eaten away about the neck and shoulder. they moan with a gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move. a young black zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one arm, draws close to the black trooper. the big man aims his pistol. it clicks... empty. he quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload. the zombie pulls closer, its mouth wide. roger steps up behind the other trooper and fires into the creatures head with his automatic rifle. the black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load the pistol. roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place where several are piled together. some lie still, others writhe about. two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are eating at parts of other bodies. roger shoots them. they never look up. they don't seem to notice him at all. a loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. roger looks up.}
