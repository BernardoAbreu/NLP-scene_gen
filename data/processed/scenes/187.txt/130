<L>__{interior john quincy adams auditorium night}
<A>__{standing room only. an impassioned crowd.}
<C>__{anglo woman}
<D>__{... i wanna know if this boy was killed and whether it was gang related.}
<A>__{the audience erupts in unanimous support...}
<C>__{anglo woman}
<P>__{(playing to crowd now)}
<D>__{as a mother and a taxpayer, i have a right to know. and if it was gang related then i want tighter security...}
<A>__{at this point she's drowned out by the crowd. on stage the discipline committee, including trevor, childress, hyland and quinn sit at the dais. garcia stands at the podium, waiting for silence. mrs. ford, the assistant principal, a full figured black woman in her mid fifties, stands alongside him, gesturing for the crowd to settle down.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{the death...}
<P>__{(too noisy)}
<D>__{the death of benito chacon is not gang related.}
<C>__{mr. garcia }
<D>__{that's something you heard on the news. it's wrong. it's misinformation.}
<C>__{hispanic man}
<P>__{(shouting out)}
<D>__{who says? how can you be so sure? you're talking about my kid's safety.}
<C>__{mrs. ford}
<D>__{please, everyone just calm down.}
<A>__{audience settles.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{thank you, mrs. ford.}
<P>__{(now)}
<D>__{... the police at this point aren't even sure if it's a case of murder. the reason we're having this meeting tonight is to quash all the rumors floating around out there. okay. here's what we do know. benny chacon ultimately died from a drug overdose, technically it was morphine.}
<P>__{(volume rising again)}
<D>__{which is what heroin breaks down into...}
<C>__{stevie }
<D>__{... dat's bullshit! benny was no junkie! i know who did it!}
<A>__{heads turn... ... ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside one of the doors at the back of the hall... up at the dais, trevor notices her.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{it's not the gangbangers y'gotta worry about. it's the teachers!}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{that's exactly the type of rumor we don't need, mr. littleton.}
<A>__{stevie deliberately stands and points at trevor with vitriol in his eyes...}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{... it was garfield.}
<A>__{the audience grows silent.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<P>__{(losing his patience)}
<D>__{say one more word and you're suspended.}
<C>__{mrs. ford}
<D>__{... sit down, stevie.}
<A>__{trevor doesn't even flinch. childress scrutinizes him with a glance.}
<C>__{stevie}
<P>__{(ranting)}
<D>__{you're a fuckin' murderer, garfield!}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<P>__{(calling for assistance)}
<D>__{victor?}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{... maybe i can't prove it but i know he did it. he fucked up cesar and he killed benny.}
<P>__{(to crowd)}
<D>__{ast 'im!}
<A>__{as victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove stevie...}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{touch me and i will sue yer ass!}
<P>__{(as victor backs off; now to trevor)}
<D>__{yer dead, g! yer a dead man!}
<A>__{with that stevie shoves victor aside and bolts for the door. garcia attempts to regain his composure... trevor glances back to the spot where ellen was standing... but now she's gone.}
