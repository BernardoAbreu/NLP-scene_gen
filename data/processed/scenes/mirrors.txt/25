<D>__{why did they say on tv that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? why did they lie?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{sometimes they make mistakes, michael. it happens...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{grown ups don't make mistakes. only little children do.}
<A>__{slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman. daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her father's car approaching }
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{daddy!}
