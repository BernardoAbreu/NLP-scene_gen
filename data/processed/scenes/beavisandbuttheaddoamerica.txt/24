<L>__{exterior las vegas day}
<B>__{montage song begins.}
<D>__{note: i would like this to be a well known band (red hot chili peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern las vegas lounge act. i think a song like "what am i gonna do with you" by barry white or something obnoxious like "bicostal" by peter allan would be cool. or maybe sinatra's "you make me feel so young" would be best.}
<A>__{the car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.}
