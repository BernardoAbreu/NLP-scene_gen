<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{grace's jeep cuts hard across the desert. grace has a wild, excited look on her face. bobby sits next to her looking somewhat nervous.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{she'll take you out somewhere in the desert. she loves it out there; ridin' through the red rock and the mesas. so do i. i guess we got that in common. she'll ride you out someplace quiet. someplace deserted.}
<T>__{fade to:}
<L>__{exterior desert later day}
<A>__{grace has stopped the jeep on a plateau. bobby sits beneath its shade while grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the heat. vultures swoop above.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{there won't be anyone for miles around. just the two of you and some prairie dogs. that's all. you can sweet talk her a little if you like. makes no difference to me. just put her at ease, make her feel relaxed then do it .}
<A>__{jake's v.o. ends. the scene is now synch with real time.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{are there snakes out here?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{they hear you comin'. they won't bother you. just don't sneak up on 'em.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{doesn't the isolation bother you?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah, but i like the sun. i grew up on a reservation. the sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. jake's the same way. he loves the desert. i guess we're alike that way. that's about the only way.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you love him?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{did you ever?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{depends on what you call love. i grew up on a reservation. a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. that's where they stick indians, bobby. that's where they leave us to die. my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. there's no hope there... jake was my ticket out. mom and me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{is that why you're with him?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i let him think he was courtin' me, but i reeled him in like a fish on a line. i wanted him. i wanted what he could give me, and i would've done anything to get him. is that love?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm guessing no.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah, i guess you're right.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm still here, aren't i? see this?}
<A>__{grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert. the vultures are very much a part of this landscape.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{all this nothing? it doesn't get to jake like it gets to me. he says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you could leave him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know how.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{walk away.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's not that easy. maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. i can't. i don't want to be alone. i need to know i'm going to be taken care of.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you need a meal ticket is what you mean. some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{is that so bad? it's not like i wouldn't try to make him happy. for awhile, anyway. i mean, i would ... do things for him. i guess i'm no good that way. i guess i tried to sucker you along like that. do you hate me for it? i wouldn't blame you if you did. but maybe it's like you said: you just got to do whatever it takes to get out.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{whatever it takes.}
<A>__{grace steps to the edge of the plateau.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i wish i was a bird. i know it's stupid. every child says that. when i was growing up some of the old ones on the reservation believed people could actually change into animals. i wish i could.}
<A>__{we see bobby behind grace. he stares at her standing on the edge of the plateau. he rises and walks towards her slowly, but with deliberation.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{if i was a bird i would fly to florida; to disney world. i always wanted to go there. i'd fly to new york. maybe. i guess new york isn't the best place to be a bird. i'd fly to st. louis, then new orleans, all over texas. then i'd fly to california. i guess by then i'd have seen it all and i could die.}
<A>__{bobby now stands a few feet behind grace. she kicks a rock and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness below.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{they say you don't feel anything. the shock kills you before you hit the ground. i don't know how they would know that. but i heard it's just like flying; straight down into the ground. i guess if it doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.}
<A>__{bobby tenses himself. sweat forms on his brow as he stands directly behind grace with his hands extended before him. they hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward. suddenly grace wheels. startled by bobby she almost falls over the edge. bobby grabs her, her weight still going back. grace's life is literally in his hands. she looks down at the ground far below, then up into bobby's eyes. she shows no fear, but instead wears a curious smirk.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hate's a funny thing. right now i bet you don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck me.}
<A>__{bobby hesitates, then pulls grace close and kisses her with great ardor on the lips.}
