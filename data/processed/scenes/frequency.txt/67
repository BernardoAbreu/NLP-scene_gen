<L>__{exterior buxton warehouse dusk 1969}
<A>__{located off the east river in lower manhattan. the 9th battalion fire trucks are first on the scene. a couple of green & whites are already there, uniform cops keeping a few onlookers at a safe distance. flames shoot out from the 4th and 5th floor windows. starting to lick their way up to the 6th floor and roof. smoke billows out of the windows on the 3rd and 2nd floors. lighter smoke spirals out from the door on the 1st floor. frank, gibson and other firemen under butch's command take stock of the situation and start to deploy. hoses are run from hydrants to the pumper trucks. the ladder is swung into position for an assault on the roof.}

<A>__{frank nods in agreement. directly above them, another bolt of lightning cracks through the darkening sky. a death shudder creeps up frank's spine. and for the first time in his life, frank sullivan is scared shitless. frank stares up at the sky, transfixed. thunder punches the sky with a huge roar. rain starts to fall. and in the distance, as if from inside the burning building, a faint screaming is first heard, and growing louder.}
