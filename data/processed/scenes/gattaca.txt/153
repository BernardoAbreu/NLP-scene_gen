<L>__{exterior beach. night.}
<A>__{jerome and anton walk down a dune together towards the beach not far from gattaca an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black sea. jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end of his thumb. a drop of blood oozes out. he offers the shell to anton but anton does not take it. both men begin to disrobe. the brothers stand beside each other on the sand once again anton still the more athletically built of the two. together, they enter the raging surf. diving through the breaking waves, they begin to swim. in the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by side. they swim a long distance, anton waiting for his brother to tire. but the pace does not slacken. anton pulls up in the water. sensing his brother is no longer beside him, jerome also pulls up. they tread water several yards apart.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(attempting to conceal his distress)}
<D>__{how are you doing this, vincent? how have you done}
<A>__{any of this?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{now is your chance to find out.}
<A>__{jerome swims away a second time. anton is forced to follow once again. angry now, gritting his teeth, anton calls upon the same determination we have witnessed during his constant swimming in the pool. he puts on a spurt, slowly reeling in jerome. anton gradually draws alongside jerome, certain that this effort will demoralize his older brother. but jerome has been foxing waiting for him to catch up. jerome smiles at anton. with almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again. anton is forced to go with him. they swim again for a long distance. it is anton who gradually becomes demoralized his strokes weaken, his will draining away. anton pulls up, exhausted and fearful. jerome also pulls up. however his face displays none of anton's anxiety. they tread water several yards apart. the ocean is choppier now. the view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the peaks of the waves.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(panic starting to show)}
<D>__{vincent, where's the shore? we're too far out. we have to go back!}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{too late for that. we're closer to the other side.}
<A>__{anton looks towards the empty horizon.}
<C>__{anton}
<A>__{what other side? how far do you want to go?!}
<D>__{do you want to drown us both?}
<P>__{(becoming hysterical)}
<D>__{how are we going to get}
<A>__{back?! jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother, a disturbingly serene smile.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(eerily calm)}
<D>__{you wanted to know how i did it. that's how i did it, anton. i never saved anything for the swim back.}
<A>__{anton stares at jerome, aghast. the two men face each other in silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling ocean. jerome turns and heads back towards the shore. anton is left alone with the terrifying realization. the only sound, the wind and the water.}
