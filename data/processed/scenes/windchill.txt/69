<A>__{she exits the stranded car into the frigid cold. the cop waits, facing away, in the spotlight like glare of his idling patrol car's headlights. she walks back toward him, finds him mopping the back of his neck with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{this is all we have.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{some weather we're having...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah, it's really coming down.}
<P>__{(indicating the money)}
<D>__{so what do you say? how `bout a little christmas spirit here?}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<P>__{(still facing away)}
<D>__{you know, this is one bad stretch of road. all kinds of trouble going on up here: kids drag racing. niggers hauling booze across the state lines. lady drivers breaking down, no one ever hears from them again...}
<A>__{her bravado begins to flag. this isn't the kind of police officer she's used to dealing with. she glances worriedly back in the direction of the olds.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{we just want to get out of here, so if you could just }
<A>__{she holds out the money, but he ignores it.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{let me tell you, i've seen a lot of fatalities on this road...}
<A>__{he takes off his hat so he can mop his brow. as he turns, she gets a first good look at his face: handsome but hard, with cruel snake charmer's eyes looking back at her...}
<C>__{highway patrolman }
<D>__{you're lucky i came along when i did. so why don't we get in my car...}
<A>__{she's scared now. she looks past him to where the highway patrol car sits idling in a red plume of exhaust fumes.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(backing away)}
<D>__{i think maybe i just want to go back }
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere!}
<A>__{she startles as if slapped, too horrified to parse his meaning. she continues backing away until she's backed up against the trunk of the olds.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{the cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop. she glances over her shoulder to see what he's looking at: a light on the hilltop, where the burned out ruins stand. and weirder still, there's a figure in silhouette standing nearby. someone watching. the cop darkens, enraged by this unwanted audience. his face contorts, fury building in him until he trembles with it. he rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver, says to her in a low urgent voice:}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{get in the damn patrol car...}
<A>__{she starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him. the highway patrolman's boots crunching behind her. the patrol car's headlights are blinding. she moves towards them, squinting, as if moving down a tunnel of light.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(terrified; beginning to cry)}
<D>__{please... just let us go...}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{hurry up...we've got an audience...}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(begging)}
<D>__{but we didn't do anything! please! we won't tell anybody if you let us }
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{get away from her you bastard!}
<A>__{suddenly the guy appears brandishing a crowbar. he swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolman's head. the cop's head crumples inward. the cop's expression of fury suddenly stutters, like film slipping in the projector as two worlds that should never intersect, do, violently for an instant, the cop's face appears...charred. like a human face projected onto a scorched and melting balloon. the image flickers and on an ear splitting howl we }
