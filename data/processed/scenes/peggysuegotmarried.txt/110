<A>__{peggy turns to face her parents, holding up her homemade pantyhose with a flourish.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{ta da! pantyhose! the death of the garter belt! of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. what do you think?}
<C>__{mr. kelcher}
<D>__{this is your great invention?}
<P>__{(to mrs. kelcher)}
<D>__{would you wear those things?}
<C>__{mrs. kelcher}
<D>__{would they go over my girdle or under?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{instead of a girdle. and light as a feather.}
<C>__{mrs. kelcher.}
<D>__{jack, i think she's got something there.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{and we won't just sell them in department stores. we'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets.}
<C>__{mr. kelcher}
<D>__{that's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you need a partner. there's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, mr. fitzsimmons. i've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.}
<C>__{mrs. kelcher}
<D>__{isn't that awfully forward?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{we've got to move fast. this is an idea whose time has come.}
<C>__{mr. kelcher}
<D>__{you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{wrong, dad. your idea.}
