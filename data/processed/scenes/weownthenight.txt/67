<L>__{interior "hello" phone office}
<A>__{a small office equipped with telephones, headsets, and fold out chairs. lockers line the walls. bobby's on the phone, waiting for someone to answer. reveal: jack and michael are here too, with headphones on, listening in. finally:}
<C>__{accented voice }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{bobby green}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i decided i wanna buy in.}
<C>__{pavel lubyarsky }
<D>__{how much we talkin' `bout here, dude?}
<A>__{bobby looks to the cops. they start mouthing something, but he ignores them:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{fifty k, to start.}
<A>__{mike and jack's hairs stand on end upon hearing this.}
<C>__{pavel lubyarsky}
<D>__{oh, [the] man's gonna be good with that. how `bout tomorrow night?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<C>__{pavel lubyarsky}
<D>__{arright. we'll meet at el caribe, `round midnight?}
<P>__{(with a sly laugh)}
<D>__{that way, you could dance a little, say hi to your girlfriend...}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{okay. i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{bobby hangs up.}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{most expensive phone call i ever made.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{we'll get it back for you.}
<A>__{jack reaches into a nearby locker for something, then approaches bobby and hands him a small black beeper.}
<C>__{michael solo }
<D>__{now listen: from now on, you'll get all your information through this, at an undisclosed location. your contact with us is over after you leave here.}
<A>__{bobby takes the beeper. michael touches his shoulder:}
<C>__{michael solo }
<D>__{just be smart about things. okay? you get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead. an informant dies, they talk about you for a day. a week later, ain't no one remembers your name.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{moral of the story is, don't die. you understand?}
<A>__{angle on bobby as he sobers. nods. then:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you need to promise me something, though. you won't investigate my girlfriend she's, she don't know any better.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{she won't be a target. just make sure she don't open her mouth.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i will take care of it.}
<A>__{michael grabs bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{you know we known you your whole life, kid? good luck.}
