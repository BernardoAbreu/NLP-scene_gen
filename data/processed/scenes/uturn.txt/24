<L>__{interior truck stop diner later}
<A>__{it is a little worn diner type stop one would find on most any open road: counter with stools, laminated menus, a wurlitzer in the corner belching out country tunes. business is slow but it's the only restaurant in town. there is a short order cook in the kitchen, and flo, a hard looking waitress is behind the counter. a couple of regular drivers, ed and boyd, are seated on the stools, boyd is flipping a coin.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{one hundred thirteen degrees. that was back in july of forty seven. that afternoon it dropped down to forty three! true story.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{one time last year i remember it went from 98 to 23 same day. wind, black clouds come out like...}
<A>__{bobby comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the counter. he has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess. he buries his face in the menu.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you got a beer?}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{what kind?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{beck's.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{no beck's. a 1, coors...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{heineken?}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{no, we ain't got no heineken. we got miller.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{genuine draft?}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{no. just plain ol' miller. now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i will fuckin' take it. to go.}
<C>__{short order cook}
<D>__{flo, cheeseburger bleedin'.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{i will be right back with that beer.}
<A>__{flo moves off.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{...and a waitress named flo. christ.}
<A>__{as bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a police radio crackling. he now feels something against his foot. he looks down and sees a cat rubbing against his leg. he gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fucking cat.}
<A>__{in the background, two teenagers sit at a booth. toby looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white t shirt. his hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school. his girl, jenny, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. she is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look. toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom. after he is gone jenny walks to bobby.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hey, mister. you gotta quarter for the juke?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i wanna play a song on the juke. you got a quarter?}
<A>__{bobby looks at jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her. he can't resist putting a little charm into it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what happened to your hand?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i cut it shaving; i know, i gotta be more careful.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{got any requests?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that country shit all sounds the same to me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how about i pick one out for you?}
<A>__{bobby half smiles. jenny plays a song. patsy cline's "your cheatin' heart." jenny takes up a stool next to bobby's.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you like patsy cline? i just love her. how come, i wonder, she don't put out no more new records.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{cause she's dead.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{gee, that's sad. don't that make you sad?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i've had time to get over it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're not from around here, are you? where you from?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oz.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you ain't from oz. oz is in that movie.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're too quick for me.}
<A>__{toby walks back into the room. he looks at jenny. he looks at bobby. he looks at jenny talking to bobby. he loses it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no....no....no i'm seeing but i'm not believin'...stop the wedding. this can't be. hey! what are you doing with my girl?}
<A>__{bobby says nothing, ignoring toby.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i axed you a question.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{aw, toby, we weren't doing nothing. we was just talking.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. (to bobby) now, i'm not going to axe you again, mister. what were you doing with my girl?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i wasn't doing anything.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that's not the way it looked to me. looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{make time? is everybody in this town on drugs?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{honest, toby. i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{stay out of this, jenny. we got man's business to take care of. i ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{then maybe you should've. look, pal, i wasn't making a play for your girl.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you expect me to believe that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mister, i'm calling you out.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what? you want to fight? over her?}
<A>__{bobby looks jenny over.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{toby, you go finish your soda and leave the man alone.}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{you know who i am? toby n. tucker. everyone round here call me tnt. you know why?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{let's see...they're not very imaginative?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{'cause i'm just like dynamite. and when i go off, somebody gets hurt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fine. i was making time with your girl. now i'm scared to death and i learned my lesson. now can you go away?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{not before i settle with you, chickenshit!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{christ, i don't believe this!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{stand up.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i wasn't hitting on your girl!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{stand up, mister, or i will beat you where you sit.}
<A>__{bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with toby now with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either. he sits there.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{toby, you stop it now! can't you see he's got a hurt hand?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{don't you never mind, flo. this is gonna be over real quick.}
<A>__{reluctantly bobby rises, facing off against toby, each clenching their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move. the tension builds. we see it on the faces of jenny, flo and the regulars. just then the record on the juke ends and the needle scratches off. there is the crackle of a police radio as the door to the diner opens and sheriff virgil potter walks in. the tension eases. toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're lucky, mister. don't think it's over. i called you out and i'm gonna see}
<P>__{this through. you hear me? (to jenny)}
<D>__{come on, girl. i got half a mind to make you walk home.}
<A>__{toby takes jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{my lord, that little baby of yours virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{you know how that toby is. thinks every man he sees is after his jenny.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{more like jenny is after every man she sees.}
<C>__{flo }
<D>__{you pay toby no mind. he just likes to show off for his girl. give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. still want that beer?}
<P>__{bobby (tense, seeing the sheriff)}
<D>__{i will take it to go.}
<A>__{bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{how's it with you, sheriff?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{already started out bad. couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over jamilla's grocery store this morning. it was a real shootout.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{the old witch killed 'em both.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{poor thing. is she all right?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{sure, when the sons of bitches tried to steal her wedding ring. that's when she started shooting. can't blame her. the ring was all carlos left her when he died. store's a mess.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{it's the desert. that's what it is. the desert makes everybody crazy. ain't that right, sheriff? people go crazy out here.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{come on, boyd. i've got to make tracks. that yogurt's got to make santa fe before it spoils.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{dr. pepper don't have that problem.}
<A>__{ed and boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit. flo stands near the cash register with bobby's beer.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{i can't open off sale for you, sugar.}
<A>__{bobby pays for the beer ($1.75). flo opens the register.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{let me get your change.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.}
<A>__{the sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{you be careful now, virgil.}
<A>__{just as the words leave flo's mouth the sheriff spills the pot. it shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere. flo runs over to him.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{virgil! now look at what you done! are you all right?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i think i burned my gun hand!}
<A>__{as flo bends to wipe the counter, virgil touches her intimately.}
<C>__{sheriff }
<D>__{how 'bout we put something soft on it}
<P>__{later? (a look)}
<C>__{flo}
<P>__{(quietly) i could put some butter on it,}
<D>__{hon'. (her normal abrasive voice) it'd serve you right, you asshole. put it under some cold water. joe, run get a mop and clean this fuckin' mess up.}
<A>__{while everyone is distracted bobby notices that the register drawer has been left open. he looks around to make sure he is not being watched. slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer. it gets closer and closer. as he is about to grab the money there, the cat the same one he kicked away earlier hisses and claws at his hand. bobby jumps back startled.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{shasta! now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that? sorry about that, mister. let's see, you want $3.25. (gives it to him) you try to have a nice day now, would you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sure, i will try.}
<A>__{with the sheriff occupied, and the mexican jose mopping the floor, bobby exits.}
