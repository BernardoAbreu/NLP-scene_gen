<L>__{int pope's office night}
<A>__{langdon and the others race into the pope's office and find a truly bizarre scene. rocher is near the fireplace, brandishing his sidearm, aimed at the camerlengo, who lays on the floor, writhing in agony. his cassock is torn open, and his bare chest is seared black. a large, square brand is on the floor at rocher's feet. two of the swiss guard act without hesitation they open fire. two bullets slam into rocher's chest and he crumples. father simeon bursts into the room, and as he does the camerlengo rolls over onto one side, points his index finger at simeon, and cries out a single word:}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{illuminatus!}
<C>__{fr. simeon}
<D>__{you bastard! you sanctimonious }
<A>__{he rushes at the camerlengo and chartrand reacts on instinct, putting three bullets in father simeon's back. he falls to the floor, dead. chartrand and the guards dash to the camerlengo, who clutches his chest, convulsing in pain. langdon walks toward him, stunned, as the guards pull the camerlengo's hands away from his wound, revealing the fifth brand. the crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest. langdon looks at rocher in utter disbelief. rocher's still alive, trying to say something, holding out a hand. everyone else in the room is focused on the camerlengo, so langdon bends down, takes the dying man's hand. rocher looks up at him, desperation in his eyes, trying to communicate something but too weak to say more than:}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{for safety.}
<A>__{and his eyes close. langdon withdraws his hand from rocher's, and finds the dying man has pressed something into his palm. a key. langdon looks at it, and it gives him a thought. he turns, looks at the camerlengo, whose chest is exposed. the crossed keys are indeed branded there but they're upside down. langdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the camerlengo as chartrand gets to his feet, on his radio.}
<C>__{chartrand}
<D>__{i need a medevac to st. peter's square, right now!}
<A>__{the camerlengo struggles to a sitting position.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{order the evacuation. we only have nineteen minutes.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{the keys. they're upside down.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{you think it's a sign?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{everything has been a sign, why should this be any different?}
<A>__{he looks at rocher, dead on the floor. back at the branded keys.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{crossed keys the symbol for the papacy, upside down.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{st. peter.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(yes)}
<D>__{the first pope, he was crucified upside down, on vatican hill. right beneath where we're standing.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{"upon this rock i will build my church."...}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{or bring it down upon itself.}
<A>__{he looks back at rocher, and at father simeon, dead on the floor.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{they were conservatives, the former pope was becoming more and more liberal. maybe they loved their church so much they were willing to destroy it.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<P>__{(thinking, repeats)}
<D>__{upon this rock i will build my church.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{st. peter's tomb is the very core of christendom.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the bomb is in st. peter's tomb!}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(almost admiring it)}
<D>__{the ultimate infiltration.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{i can still change the battery if we hurry!}
