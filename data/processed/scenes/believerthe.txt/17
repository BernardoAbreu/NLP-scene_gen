<L>__{interior same five minutes later}
<A>__{danny flushed with triumph stands looking down at the city. across the room mrs. moebius & curtis zampf}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{...i thought we agreed, no anti semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... trash the blacks, fine; but...}
<C>__{mrs. moebius}
<D>__{did you see how they reacted to him?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yes, of course. but that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves nazis. if you want a modern fascism, you don't mention jews.}
<C>__{mrs. moebius}
<D>__{it's a romantic movement, curtis. it always has been.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{lina, the thousand year reich barely lasted a decade.... do you really want to go down that road again? in america of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...}
<A>__{she looks over at danny, now chatting with carla....}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{he's very bright.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{he speaks well. but what do we do with him?}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{let's find out who he is.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{you mean who he really is.}
<A>__{on danny & carla}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you're not in school? what do you do?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i work at the big boy warehouse. in queens. i drive a fork lift.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{where'd you read all that stuff?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i just read it....}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{young man...}
<A>__{he turns. she's beckoning to him. he gives carla a look, then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates. curtis offers him a drink; he declines. carla takes one.}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{lina moebius. and you are...?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{daniel balinterior}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{balint?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's german.}
<C>__{lina }
<D>__{what part of germany are you people from?}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{from the rhineland originally.}
<C>__{lina }
<D>__{are you with the fbi, mr. balint?... or any other law enforcement agency?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i was going to ask you the same thing.}
<A>__{smiles, laughter. everyone seems to relax.}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{so what are you really after, daniel?... do you just want to kill jews, or do you have something larger in mind?}
<A>__{carla watches, silent. danny is aware of both mother and daughter.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{without blood a willingness to spill it there's no real power, no authority.}
<C>__{lina}
<P>__{(pleased by this)}
<D>__{curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we're already marginal. we are saying what no one else has the guts to say. isn't that precisely our appeal?}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{so what jew would you kill first?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{ilio manzetti...former ambassador to france. managing partner at damon, schwarzchild.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(to lina, explaining)}
<D>__{an investment banking house.}
<C>__{mrs. moebius}
<D>__{he's jewish? manzetti?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{totally. the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{how would you kill him?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... but ideally on a new york street at midday, using a small caliber automatic without a silencer.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{why no silencer?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you want it to be an event.}
<A>__{lina stands, takes a sherry. everyone else rises with her.}
<C>__{lina}
<D>__{danny, why don't you come visit us in the country. we have young men with lots of energy and no ideas. maybe you could give them something to think about.... bring your friends, if you like....}
<A>__{as curtis leads him toward the door, danny looks around for carla, hears women's voices arguing in german. frustrated, he goes down the stairs....}
