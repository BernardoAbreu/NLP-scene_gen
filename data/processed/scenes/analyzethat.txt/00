<L>__{interior dimly lit bar night}
<A>__{two men, caesar and marty "ducks," stand at the end of the deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to the exotic dancer grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle of the small stage. body language and charisma tell us that caesar is the boss, "ducks" his lieutenant.}

<D>__{it's peezee. gotta be. he hates your fuckin' guts.}
<C>__{caesar}
<P>__{(brooding)}

<C>__{ducks}
<D>__{who else knew about the money? and how did peezee know they popped tony cisco when we didn't even hear about it 'til last night?}

<C>__{ducks}
<P>__{(pressing)}

<C>__{caesar}
<P>__{(slowly rising to his full height)}
<D>__{i think it was you, ducks.}
<A>__{caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a sawed off shotgun, moves closer to ducks. the exotic dancer splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.}

<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{you gotta be kiddin'!}
<A>__{caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have appeared, holding automatic weapons.}

<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{a dead fuckin' idiot.}
