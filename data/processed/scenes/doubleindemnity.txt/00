<A>__{a 1 los angeles a downtown intersection it is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic. at the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at go. approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a dodge 1938 coupe. it is driven erratically and weaving a little, but not out of control. when the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to stop. car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through. a 2 a light newspaper truck is crossing the intersection at right angles. it swerves and skids to avoid the dodge, which goes on as though nothing had happened. the truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. there is a large sign on the truck: "read the los angeles times". the truck driver's infuriated face stares after the coupe. a 3 the coupe continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building. a 4 the coupe stops. the headlights are turned off. for a second nothing happens, then the car door opens slowly. a man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself. he's a tall man, about thirty five years old. from the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder. he straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket. he leans into the car. he brings out a light weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. he shuts the car door and walks toward the building. a 5 entrance of the building above the closed, double plate glass doors is lettered: "pacific building". to the left of entrance there is a drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. the man comes stiffly up to the doors. (camera has moved up with him). he tries the doors. they are locked. he knocks on the glass. inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. one elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby. the man knocks again. the night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance. he comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half eaten sandwich in the other. he finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door and pulls it open.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{hello there, mr. neff.}
<A>__{neff walks in past him without answering. a 6 interior lobby neff is walking towards elevator. night watchman looks after him, relocks door, follows to elevator. neff enters elevator. a 7 elevator neff stands leaning against wall. he is pale and haggard with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.}

<D>__{working pretty late aren't you, mr. neff?}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(tight lipped)}
<D>__{late enough.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{you look kind of all in at that.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm fine. let's ride.}
<A>__{night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{how's the insurance business, mr. neff?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{they wouldn't ever sell me any. they say i've got something loose in my heart. i say it's rheumatism.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(scarcely listening)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the elevator stops.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<P>__{(surly)}
<D>__{twelve.}
<A>__{the door opens. across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered: pacific all risk insurance company founded 1906 main office. there is a little light beyond the glass doors. neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. he pushes them open. the night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close. a 8 twelfth floor insurance office (note for set designer: our insurance company occupies the entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. on the twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales departments. these all open off a balcony which runs all the way around. from the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, business machines, etc.) neff comes through the double entrance doors from the reception room. the twelfth floor is dark. some light shines up from the eleventh floor. neff takes a few steps then holds on to the balcony railing and looks down. a 9 the eleventh floor from above neff's point of view two colored women are cleaning the offices. one is dry mopping the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, etc. a colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square box. he shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a little tune. a 10 neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, and walks past two or three offices (camera with him) towards a glass door with number twenty seven on it and three names: henry b. anderson, walter neff, louis l. schwartz. neff opens the door. a 11 interior neff's office dark three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records underneath, telephones on all three desks. water cooler with inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. two windows facing toward front of building. venetian blinds. no curtains. waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. the office has not been cleaned. neff enters, switches on desk lamp. he looks across at dicta phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. he leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling fainterior he turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps and falls heavily into a swivel chair. his head goes far back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. for a moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. his good hand flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt. this was quite an effort. he rests for a second, breathing hard. with the help of his good hand he edges his left elbow up on the arm rest of the chair, supports it there and then pulls his jacket wide. a heavy patch of dark blood shows on his shirt. he pushes his chair along the floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against the wound inside his shirt. next, he gets a handful of water and splashes it on his face. the water runs down his chin and drips. he breathes heavily, with closed eyes. he fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks at it. there is blood on it. he wheels himself back to the desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. some are blood stained, a few are clean. he takes one, puts it between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. he takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose. he pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. he presses the button switch on the horn. the sound stops, the record revolves on the cylinder. he begins to speak:}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{office memorandum, walter neff to barton keyes, claims manager. los angeles, july 16th, 1938. dear keyes: i suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it. i don't like the word confession. i just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see, because it was smack up against your nose. you think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager, such a wolf on a phoney claim. well, maybe you are, keyes, but let's take a look at this dietrichson claim, accident and double indemnity. you were pretty good in there for a while, all right. you said it wasn't an accident. check. you said it wasn't suicide. check. you said it was murder. check and double check. you thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. it was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. when it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what i mean. want to know who killed dietrichson? hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, keyes. i killed dietrichson. me, walter neff, insurance agent, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars }
<P>__{(he glances down at his wounded shoulder)}
<D>__{until a little while ago, that is. yes, i killed him. i killed him for money and a woman and i didn't get the money and i didn't get the woman. pretty, isn't it?}
<A>__{he interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. he takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it two or three times, and kills it. he picks up the horn again.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(his voice is now quiet and contained)}
<D>__{it began last may. about the end of may, it was. i had to run out to glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks. on the way back i remembered this auto renewal on los feliz. so i decided to run over there. it was one of those calif. spanish houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago. this one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks that is, if he ever finished paying for it.}
<A>__{as he goes on speaking, slow dissolve to: a 12 dietrichson home los feliz district palm trees line the street, middle class houses, mostly in spanish style. some kids throwing a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns. an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the spanish houses. neff gets out. he carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back of his head. his movements are easy and full of ginger. he inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch and rings the bell.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{it was mid afternoon, and it's funny, i can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that block. i felt like a million. there was no way in all this world i could have known that murder sometimes can smell like honeysuckle...}
<A>__{a 13 exterior dietrichson home entrance door neff rings the bell again and waits. the door opens. a maid, about forty five, rather slatternly, opens the door.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{mr. dietrichson in?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{who wants to see him?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the name is neff. walter neff.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{if you're selling something }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, it's mr. dietrichson i'd like to talk to, and it's not magazine subscriptions.}
<A>__{he pushes past her into the house. a 14 hallway dietrichson home spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. a wrought iron staircase curves down from the second floor. a fringed mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. a large tapestry hangs on the wall. downstairs, the dining room to one side, living room on the other side visible through a wide archway. all of this, architecture, furniture, decorations, etc., is genuine early leo carrillo period. neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door open.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{listen, mr. dietrichson's not in.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how soon do you expect him?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{he'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.}
<A>__{at this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what is it, nettie? who is it?}
<A>__{neff looks up. a 15 upper landing of staircase (from below) phyllis dietrichson stands looking down. she is in her early thirties. she holds a large bath towel around her very appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees. she wears no stockings, no nothing. on her feet a pair of high heeled bedroom slippers with pom poms. on her left ankle a gold anklet.}
<C>__{maid's voice}
<D>__{it's for mr. dietrichson.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(looking down at neff)}
<D>__{i'm mrs. dietrichson. what is it?}
<A>__{a 16 shooting down from upper landing neff looks up, takes his hat off.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how do you do, mrs. dietrichson. i'm walter neff, pacific all risk.}
<A>__{a 17 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{pacific all what?}
<A>__{a 18 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{pacific all risk insurance company. it's about some renewals on the automobiles, mrs. dietrichson. i've been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks. he's never at his office.}
<A>__{a 19 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{is there anything i can do?}
<A>__{a 20 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the insurance ran out on the fifteenth. i'd hate to think of your getting a smashed fender or something while you're not fully covered.}
<A>__{a 21 phyllis she glances over her towel costume.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(with a little smile)}
<D>__{perhaps i know what you mean, mr. neff. i've just been taking a sun bath.}
<A>__{a 22 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no pigeons around, i hope... about those policies, mrs. dietrichson i hate to take up your time }
<A>__{a 23 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that's all right. if you can wait till i put something on, i will be right down. nettie, show mr. neff into the living room.}
<A>__{she turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.] a 24 entrance hall neff watches phyllis out of sight. he speaks to the maid while still looking up.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{where would the living room be?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{in there, but they keep the liquor locked up.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's okay. i always carry my own keys.}
<A>__{he goes through the archway. maid goes off the other way. a 25 living room neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. he looks around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top. neff glances them over: mr. dietrichson, age about fifty one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a rotarian look about him; lola dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. neff walks away from the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the rug. his eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. he carefully straightens it out with his foot. his back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. he turns and looks through the arch.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{the living room was still stuffy from last night's cigars. the windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air. the furniture was kind of corny and old fashioned, but it had a comfortable look, as if people really sat in it. on the piano, in couple of fancy frames, were mr. dietrichson and lola, his daughter by his first wife they had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport, but, to tell you the truth, keyes, i wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then, nor in auto renewals, nor in mr. dietrichson and his daughter lola. i was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me, and i wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us.}
<A>__{a 26 staircase (from neff's point of view) phyllis dietrichson is coming downstairs. first we see her feet, with pom pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle. camera pulls back slowly as she descends, until we see all of her. she is wearing a pale blue summer dress.}
<C>__{phyllis' voice}
<D>__{i wasn't long, was i?}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{not at all, mrs. dietrichson.}
<B>__{camera pulls back with her into the living room.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i hope i've got my face on straight.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's perfect for my money.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(crossing to the mirror over the fireplace)}
<D>__{won't you sit down, mr. neff is the name, isn't it?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{with two f's, like in philadelphia. if you know the story.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what story?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the philadelphia story. what are we talking about?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(she works with her lipstick)}
<D>__{about the insurance. my husband never tells me anything.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's on your two cars, the la salle and the plymouth.}
<A>__{he crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase. she turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we've been handling this insurance for three years for mr. dietrichson...}
<P>__{(his eyes have caught the anklet)}
<D>__{that's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we'd hate to see the policies lapse. of course, we give him thirty days. that's all we're allowed to give.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i guess he's been too busy down at long beach in the oil fields.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{could i catch him home some evening for a few minutes?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i suppose so. but he's never home much before eight.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that would be fine with me.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{you're not connected with the automobile club, are you?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no, the all risk, mrs. dietrichson. why?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{somebody from the automobile club has been trying to get him. do they have a better rate?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{if your husband's a member.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no, he isn't.}
<A>__{phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{well, he'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with. the automobile club is fine. i never knock the other fellow's merchandise, mrs. dietrichson, but i can do just as well for you. i have a very attractive policy here. it wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband.}
<A>__{he consults the policies he is holding.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{for instance, we're writing a new kind of fifty percent retention feature in the collision coverage.}

<D>__{you handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds?}
<A>__{she sits down again, in the same position as before.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{all kinds. fire, earthquake, theft, public liability, group insurance, industrial stuff and so on right down the line.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{accident insurance?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{accident insurance? sure, mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{his eyes fall on the anklet again.}
