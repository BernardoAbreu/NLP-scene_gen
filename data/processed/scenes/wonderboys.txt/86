<A>__{crabtree snaps james' manuscript closed.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you know based on what i've read this is a very exciting piece of material, this big parade.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{love. it's love facade and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i've been doing this a long time, tripp. i feel this kid in my bones.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{only in your bones?}
<A>__{grady smirks, glances at crabtree, but gets a surprise; crabtree offers no snappy come back, no antic wordplay. he just stares out the window, his voice distant.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{no. i think i might be right. i've felt it before...}
<A>__{as crabtree's voice trails off, grady studies him.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{how bad is it for you?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{bad enough. and god knows i don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{competence.}
<A>__{grady and crabtree look at each other a moment, then crabtree smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up james' knapsack, rummaging through the contents.}
<C>__{crabtree }
<D>__{so tell me about you and the chancellor.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what's to tell?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{plenty, i'm sure. but, for what it's worth...}
<A>__{crabtree fishes out the biography of erroll flynn, gives it a look.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{...i like her.}
<A>__{grady peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{me too.}
