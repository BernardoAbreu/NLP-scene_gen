<D>__{all right, thats it! (he leans over and picks up his saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again, grunting. adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall, breathing heavily, looking dazed. lawrence continues to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. he gets pissed off and throws the blade down.) ah, damn it!!}
<A>__{back to adam, still looking dazed. suddenly, a look of realization dawns upon his face. the electrocution has jogged his memory.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(wide eyed) i remember everything now. (lawrence glances over at him.) i remember}
<D>__{how i got here.}
<A>__{flashback to adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones. he walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. he gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red lit hallway to his apartment. he goes inside, closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge. the entire apartment is very rundown, decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as adam described it earlier. there is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty. adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. he sighs, then closes the door. he heads over to his darkroom, closing the door behind him. the lighting is dark red. he puts the camera down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts them down off to the side. he sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. it is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. the man is in fact lawrence. to the left of that one is a shot of lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes. the camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to black, industrial music playing over the shot. cut to adam sleeping in the now pitch black darkroom, his head down on the table. he wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt meant to fall asleep. he looks around, confused, wondering why all the lights out. he gives a great, another problem type of sigh. he stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. he moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. another aggravated sigh. he reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt work. he looks at it, scoffs.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. on alert, he listens. he looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. he opens the creaky door into his also pitch black apartment. he takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{is someone there? (he takes a picture, the flash lighting up the area in front of him.) i can hear you. (he takes another picture, the flash lighting up a living room area. nothing yet. he moves forward more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping}
<P>__{away for light.)}
<A>__{suddenly, from behind him, an evil doll laugh is heard. he startles, spinning around.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(his voice alarmed but confused at the}
<D>__{same time) what the...? (he snaps a picture in its direction and sees the puppet from jigsaws workshop and video sitting in an armchair, continuing its evil laugh.) christ! (he reaches down and finds a baseball bat on the floor, and starts hitting the doll as hard as he can until the laugh starts to fade and then just dies out. ) what the...}
<A>__{he hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind him in a closet. he goes on alert again, holding up the baseball bat and the camera.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{who is that?! whos in there?! (he moves towards the door, shaking but trying to be a tough guy) come on out! ill kill you, you motherfucker! (he opens the door, holds the camera and takes a picture. as soon as the flash goes off we see the red robed pig thing that originally grabbed lawrence quickly}
<P>__{move forward and grab adam.)}
<A>__{suddenly, the cell phone rings. lawrence looks down at it in slight surprise. adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as well. lawrence glances over at adam and then carefully reaches down, picks it up and answers it. the scene will cut back and forth to diana and alison in the room and lawrence on the phone for the duration of the conversation.}

<P>__{(panicked) ally!}
<A>__{cut to a shot of static on tapps tv set, then tapp waking up to the sound of gunfire. he quickly looks over to the window. back to zep and alison, who are still fighting for the gun. zep manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, but she still holds on tight. another shot goes off. cut to a shot of tapp, who hears it, then looks at the tv. he sees the flash from the window on the television. he picks up his handgun and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. back in the apartment, we see diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. zep gets behind diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and the gun upwards. another shot is fired off.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(screams) ally! (adam watches him with wide eyes.)}
<A>__{the shot cuts back into the bedroom.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{mommy, help me!}
<A>__{the struggle moves over and into the dresser. zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. she spins around and with a scream stabs zep in his left leg. he screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. alison quickly goes over and finishes untying diana. cut to the main hall of the residence, where we see tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. he moves cautiously but quickly. he sees zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{freeze!}
<A>__{zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt hit. tapp fires back and skims the top of zeps head. zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. cut back to lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. he sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out oh no. adam watches him, can only imagine what hes hearing. back to the bedroom, tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at zep again, missing. alison finishes untying diana and the book from the room. zep fires at tapp again and misses. tapp fires back, but his gun jams. zep sees alison and diana run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(trying to fix his gun) what the fuck?}
<A>__{zep gets up off the floor more, but just then tapp gives up on his gun and charges at zep, screaming. he tackles zep, knocking him flat on his back. zep pushes his way up but tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. cut back to lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. back to tapp and zep, who get up to their feet. zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over tapps head. the blow stuns tapp and sends him down. zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after alison and diana. he reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.}
<C>__{zep}
<D>__{mrs. gordon? (drops old cartridge out of his gun, pops in a new one) diana?!}
<P>__{(his breathing is fast, desperate. he}
<D>__{clutches the wound on his leg.) im gonna kill your husband now, mrs. gordon.}
<P>__{(he stands up a bit straighter and hobbles}
<D>__{over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. we see tapp groaning, starting to get up. zep glances over and sees tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. he empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming.}
<A>__{back to lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. hes just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. adams eyes widen and he starts to panic.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{lawrence! (a bit of foamy spittle comes out of lawrences mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. adam watches, frightened, unsure. lawrence is out.) lawrence, get up!}
