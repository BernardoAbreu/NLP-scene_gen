<L>__{interior exterior motel room houston, texas day}
<A>__{the town car's looking a little muddy around the rims. charlie and wesley look tired as they wait in a seedy motel room. charlie sits near a window, reading diary entries aloud. wesley kicks back on the bed, fast forwarding through "genghis kunt" and talking back to the screen.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what time're they coming?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's not an exact science, wesley. he said they'll be here... my houston contact has always been very reliable.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{and then we're gonna do her right here. right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're always so coarse... "do her right here." let's just see what happens, okay?}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"i wish that i could find a way; to speak my thoughts on mother's day. there are no words that quite express; my gratitude or happiness. a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; i would not fail to give her this. i'd make her glad the whole day through; by sayin' 'mother', i love you!' p.s. i wish i could say this to my mother's face, but i can't anymore."}
<A>__{wesley rolls his eyes and turns up the volume. finally a car pulls up outside and charlie snaps the book closed. he makes a quick attempt to arrange himself and motions to wesley, who turns off the tape. a woman with greasy blonde hair and skinny legs shown off by a short skirt comes in with another man. charlie looks her over disgustedly as his face falls.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{who are you?!}
<P>__{(to the man)}
<D>__{what the... who the hell is this? man #1 easy, charlie! she's exactly who you said you were looking for.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait, wait a minute. we have a major miscommunication here. this not betty. this is not even close to betty...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what the fuck're you talking about? my name's betty...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{then i'm sorry... wrong betty.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{let's get out of here. we got another long drive ahead of us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... the fuck where i do not know, but i know it's gonna be long.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(gathering his things)}
<D>__{betty would never dress like that. she's not some trailer park slut!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and she doesn't have a sewer for a mouth...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{okay, thank you, goodbye... keep in touch...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... she's got class, and poise. lots of poise...}
<A>__{the man looks at charlie, then at wesley, who shrugs in reply as he steers them out the door.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{will you ease off on the 'poise' shit, you're spooking me here...}
