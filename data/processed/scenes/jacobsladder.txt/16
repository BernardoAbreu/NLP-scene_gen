<L>__{interior mail truck day}
<A>__{angle on the mail truck stuck in traffic. nothing is moving. horns are blaring and drivers are agitated. jacob reaches for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags. to his shock one of the bags appears to move. curious, jacob pokes at it. instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. jacob jumps back, stunned. it is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at an old wino who has been sleeping in the truck. the man's face is covered in strange bumps.}

<D>__{please! i never hurt anybody when i was alive. believe me. i don't belong here.}
<A>__{jacob gives the wino a strange look and then escorts him from the truck. a hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he leads the wino to the sidewalk. jacob pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the wino's hand. the old man crumples it into a ball and turns away. he has a frightened look on his face. jacob returns to the truck shaking his head.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{new york!}
<A>__{he climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. he notices the wino edging fearfully along the side of a building. a horn honks and traffic begins moving. when jacob looks back the wino is no longer there.}
