<D>__{everything fits, p.k. nothing is unexplained. nature is one big chain reaction. everything depends on everything else. from the smallest to the biggest. always in life an idea starts small like a tree.}
<A>__{doc shows pk a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{this tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. but this little vine can choke it and keep it small. most people are like these vines. afraid of new ideas. afraid to let things grow.}
<A>__{doc rips the vine away from the tree.}
