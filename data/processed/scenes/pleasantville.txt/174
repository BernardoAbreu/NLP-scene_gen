<A>__{david lowers the paper.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{it is silent in the soda shop. everyone sits motionless for a moment or two, letting the decree sink in. david just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness. off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was being read. all of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{hey. this thing works.}
<A>__{he hits a button and buddy holly's voice fills the soda shop. rave on blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time.}

<D>__{the little things that you say and do make we want to be with you oo oo ... rave on! it's a crazy feeling ... rave on! it's got me reelin' ...}
<A>__{jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. betty puts an arm around mr. johnson, feeling a little stronger a little safer ... the kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel ashamed. twenty "colored" faces listen as buddy holly tells them rave on. david stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship ...}
