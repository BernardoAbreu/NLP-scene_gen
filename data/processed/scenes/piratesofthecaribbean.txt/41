<L>__{interior fort charles cell block night}
<A>__{the wall of the cells explodes inward. jack pulls himself out from under rubble. moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball. beyond it: freedom. but it is centered on the other cell. the part of jack's cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.}
<C>__{prisioner}
<D>__{praise be!}
<A>__{he and the other two scramble through.}
<C>__{prisoner }
<P>__{(back to jack)}
<D>__{my sympathies, friend you've no manner of luck at all!}
<A>__{the three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view. jack is alone. cannon fire continues, occasional hits shaking the fort. the dog cowers under a long bench, key ring still in his mouth. jack sighs resigned, he picks up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog forward.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's all right, doggie ... come here,}
<A>__{boy. come here, spot. rover. fido? to his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench. jack continues to coax him closer. the key ring is nearly within jack's reach suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. he bristles, growls. he backs away from the door, whining.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{what's the matter, boy?}
<A>__{the dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall taking the keys with him. the door to the cell block bursts open. a pair of pirates step in: koehler and twigg.}
<C>__{twigg}
<D>__{this isn't the armory.}
<A>__{he turns to go, but koehler has spotted jack.}
<C>__{koehler}
<P>__{(dutch accent)}
<D>__{well, well... look what we have here, twigg. it's. captain sparrow.}
<C>__{twigg}
<D>__{huh. last time i saw you, you were all alone on a god forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. i'd heard you'd gotten off, but i didn't believe it.}
<C>__{koehler}
<D>__{did you sprout little wings and flyaway?}
<C>__{twigg}
<D>__{his fortunes aren't improved much.}
<A>__{the two laugh. jack doesn't. he steps forward, close to the bars. this puts him in a spill of moonlight. he is tight with fury.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{worry about your own fortunes. the lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.}
<A>__{koehler and twigg don't like hearing that. koehler lashes out, grabs jack by the throat through the bars. jack clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down where they enter the moonlight, koehler's wrists and hands are skeletal. jack's eyes go wide he is holding a skeleton arm.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you are cursed.}
<A>__{koehler sneers, shoves jack backwards, hard. now out of the moonlight, his hand is normal. jack stares, realizing }
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{the stories are true.}
<A>__{koehler ushers twigg toward the door. looks back.}
<C>__{koehler}
<D>__{you know nothing of hell.}
<A>__{and then they're gone.}
