<L>__{exterior the lab morning}
<A>__{it's eerily quiet in the dawn light.}
<L>__{interior lab}
<A>__{extreme close up of rick's eye as it opens, and searches the room frantically. close up of rick's hand a normal hand straining at the bonds. rick's pov groggily searches the lab, and picks up the blurred image of elijah in the distance. he's on the phone, speaking in hushed tones.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{this is red swan. may i speak to the laughing man?... yes, i will hold.}
<A>__{for a moment, elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune of "freak out," by chic. a man's laughing voice comes on the other end of the line. it laughs throughout the "conversation".}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{laughing man? red swan. i've done it! i found the perfect subject huge ego, shallow personality, almost no moral values... a lawyer? no, better. an actor. yeah, the guy from those hilarious "hey dude" movies! hahahaha }
<A>__{laughing man has stopped laughing. elijah dummies up.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{well, i liked 'em.}
<A>__{laughing man resumes laughing. elijah listens intently.}
<C>__{elijah }
<D>__{right... yes... yes, i see... but that's just it. he's not quite, uh, finished. i need more noxon so i can }
<A>__{laughing man laughs so loudly elijah has to hold the phone away.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{geez, what a grouch.}
<A>__{over on the slab, rick groans. he's waking up. elijah notices.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(to laughing man)}
<D>__{laughing man? i have to go. what about the noxon? two days? great, you can see everything then... yeah, you take it easy too.}
<A>__{elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards rick.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{wakey, wakey. time to meet and greet the new you.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{he flips the slab right side up, and holds up a mirror. rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new form. rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous, bug eyed monster!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!}
