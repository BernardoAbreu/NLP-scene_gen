<L>__{interior mine tunnel night}
<A>__{bret runs past sam and chris. sam fires her shotgun at the first spider that enters the tunnel. her gun clicks dry. she un holsters her pistols and fires.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{cover me!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you going to do?!}
<A>__{chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper support beam. more spiders come into the tunnel. sam fires desperately. chris keeps on hacking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{sam's guns click dry. spiders charge. chris swings the machete hard. the roof collapses onto the attacking spiders. chris and sam leap back. landing in a heap. clouds of dust swirl around them. they are tangled up for an awkward beat. their faces just inches from each other...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hold that thought.}
<A>__{they manage to disengage and move on.}
