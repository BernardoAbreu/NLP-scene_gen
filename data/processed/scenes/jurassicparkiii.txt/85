<L>__{exterior river canyon far wall day}
<A>__{across the canyon, grant moves across the later support. with his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance dropping into the mist. looking up, grant notices a large strut, covered with the same substance. realizing what it could be.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{a bird cage.}
<A>__{then, the sound of eric screaming.}
<L>__{exterior catwalk day}
<A>__{eric watches as a looming shape emerges from the fog a nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward. a full grown pteranodon, standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his thirty foot wings folded bat like at his side. the creature sees eric and fixes him with a demonic glare. eric cries out and dashes back down the teetering catwalk. the pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty foot wings and flies directly at him.}
<B>__{at the other end of the catwalk}
<A>__{hearing eric's screams, paul charges onto the catwalk, searching in the fog.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{eric!}

<B>__{the pteranodon}
<A>__{swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches the terrified boy from the catwalk. paul kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the pteranodon carries eric directly overhead }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{eric!}
<A>__{the flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. paul watches helplessly as eric is carried high across the canyon. paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep eric in sight. billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to keep the dinosaur in view. with a new idea, he races back up the stairs to the observation room. he has a way to save eric. when he reaches the canyon wall, paul turns a corner and runs along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon. grant and amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to catch up with paul.}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{paul! where is he? can you see him?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{i'm trying! that thing took him down this way!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{split up!}
<B>__{the pteranodon}
<A>__{carries eric deeper into the canyon. the creature's wings beat steadily overhead, and the wind is fierce. eric looks down and sees the river far below. the pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at the end of the canyon and drops eric into }
