<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior vip trading room 6:30 am}
<A>__{there are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly with one another. they are oblivious to what is about to happen. eventually, sam, will, jared, and a firm lawyer, come into the room. everyone quiets down a bit.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{alright, hey...(whistles).}
<A>__{they go silent as they notice sam standing at the head of the table. jared and the lawyer are standing off in the corner just to observe. sam looks somber.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, i know yesterday was pretty bad, i wish i could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. now i am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and i will just tell you what the fuck's going on here.}
<A>__{the lawyer looks at jared then they look at sam, he continues.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{i have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. the crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. there is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. they believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income mbs today.}
<A>__{an assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the traders in the room.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{you should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. i'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. i have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. as a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{if the floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale we all get an additional 1.3 million a piece. because of this, if you burn through your allotment by noon, get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers...}
<A>__{sam stops for a second and looks around the room.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{for those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. i don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important. i want you to hit every bite you can find. dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying...and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today. this is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out.}
<A>__{sam looks around the room again, person by person and sees that they indeed know what needs to be done.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{obviously... this is a very unique situation... if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs... i can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm, but i can tell you that i am very proud of the work we have done together here, i have been at this here for 34 years, and i know... from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here, and what you have devoted a portion of your life to. but have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted, we have accomplished much, and our talents have served some greater good...}
<A>__{he looks down at the ground, then back up around the room. then he walks out.}
