<L>__{exterior 124 bluestone rd. night.}
<A>__{paul and sethe sit on the porch together. sethe is sewing. paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sethe.}
<P>__{(she stops and looks)}
<D>__{i was thinking of looking for work around here. what do you think?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{ain't much. river mostly. and hogs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hogs is fine.}
<A>__{paul moves to where sethe is sitting.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't need much, sethe. eat, sleep, sing a little when it strikes me. i don't ask for more to..to live somewhere.}
<A>__{sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds:}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{all right. it's...it's fine with me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your girl denver. seems she's of a different mind.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{don't worry about her. she's a charmed child. nothing ever touch her too bad. from the beginning. everybody i knew dead or gone, but not her.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you got to know something, though this here ain't no better life. it's just not that other one. what i do here all i ever do is keep denver from that other..so if you stay, there's no more talk about sweet home or anything else. i won't let the past in my yard again. getting me and denver through this here life is all that matters. you understand?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dangerous to love anything that much, sethe. best thing is to love everything just a little bit..that way, when it breaks or runs off or gets taken, well maybe you'd have a little love left over for the next one.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{don't be asking me to choose, paul d. there ain't no choice here.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's the whole pointerior i'm not asking you to choose. just want to know if there's some space for me. want to know if it's more than "you can stay", "it's fine"..more like, "i want you here paul".}
<A>__{beat. sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{maybe we should leave things the way they are.}
<A>__{sethe rises to enter the house when paul's words stop her:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how are they?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{we get along.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about inside?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i don't go inside.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sethe, if i'm here with you, with denver, you can go anywhere you want. jump, if you want to, 'cause i will catch you. go as far inside as you need i will hold your ankles. make sure you get back out. i'm not saying this because i need a place to stay. i told you, i'm a walking man, but i been heading in this direction for seven years. when i got here and sat out there on the porch, waiting for you, well, i knew it wasn't the place i was heading toward. it was you. we can make a life girl. a life.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{leave it to me. see how it goes. no promises, if you don't want to make any. just see how it goes, all right?}
<A>__{sethe's heart is twisted. she wants to cry...because she feels hope...and because she feels fear.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{all right. we'll see how it goes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you willing to leave it to me?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{well..some of it.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{some?...well okay...some.}
<A>__{sethe manages a smile.}
