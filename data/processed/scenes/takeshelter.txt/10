<L>__{exterior laforche backyard day}
<A>__{curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow. he keeps an eye on hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard. the dog, red, paces by the back door. he's agitated, but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post. he barks.}
<B>__{thunder strikes.}
<A>__{curtis flinches at the loud boom. he looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead. hannah plays, unaffected by the noise. to get a better view, curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property. chain link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field. a giant storm cell gathers force on the horizon there. red barks incessantly. he winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. curtis flinches again as a bolt of lightning streaks to the ground in the distance. sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops. another crack of thunder. a light rain begins. red snaps his head around and bucks into the air. he gnashes at the rope. curtis collects hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching storm cell. he holds up his hand and studies the falling rain. it's the thick, amber colored liquid. with hannah in his arms, curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of three tornados out in the field. behind them, red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. he thrashes his head, the rope snaps, and the dog flies toward curtis and hannah. curtis turns to see red charging them. he barely has time to set hannah down before red catches him by the forearm. they crash to the ground, tangled together. rain coming down hard now. curtis yells and waves hannah back. red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in curtis' arm. blood streams from the wound. curtis screams in pain.}
