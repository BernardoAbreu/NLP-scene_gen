<L>__{exterior thickness day}
<A>__{reeling, amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick undergrowth. it's danger here, very still and quiet. she tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just makes her more emotional. she's surprised as paul wraps an arm around her to comfort her. but she doesn't fight it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm sorry amanda. i am. and i'm sorry for the things i said about him.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{no, it's...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know you liked ben. i had no right to...}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{its not about him. it's eric. he's alone out here somewhere. our baby is all alone.}
<A>__{saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{i guess i was hoping that with ben around, there'd be someone to keep him safe.}
<A>__{checking in on clients, udesky stops at the edge of the thicket. something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{dr. grant!}
<A>__{he nods for the others to take a look at this. they head over, grant at the rear. as he approaches, billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a backpack. he stops short from what he sees. looking down, we circle across the jungle floor. here we find a strange, hollowed out construction made of sod and branches. maybe six feet around. just now noticing the others' stare, paul looks down into one of the bowls at his feet, a half buried nest. it's filled with football sized eggs, laid in a spiral. and this isn't the only nest. amanda counts twelve in all, laid out in an oddly symmetrical pattern. the last to arrive, grant identifies the species in a horrified instant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{raptors.}
<A>__{and as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of snarls.}
