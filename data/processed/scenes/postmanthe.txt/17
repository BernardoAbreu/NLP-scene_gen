<L>__{exterior village square (idaho) day}
<A>__{a patch of mud. in the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where the postman wraps up a performance of macbeth. he plays it with a mis remembered gusto the people enjoy. children especially are enamored. a heavily muscled man, woody, lingers on the fringe of the crowd watching the postman with inscrutable intensity.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{they said, 'fear not, macbeth, 'til birnam wood comes to dunsinane'!}
<A>__{he looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i said, birnam wood comes to dunsinane!}
<A>__{bill trots on stage. covered with twigs, bill is birnam wood. he brays lustily. the audience laughs in delight. the children clap. only woody seems unaffected. the postman grabs two wooden swords he knows it's going well.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{arm, arm yourselves! if the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here!}
<A>__{shaking off the twigs, bill takes one of the swords in his mouth. the two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack. finally, the postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. out brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. it's a tale told by a moron. full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.}
<P>__{(waves sword)}
<D>__{but blow, wind! come wrack! at least we'll die with the harness off our back!}
<A>__{the audience erupts in applause. but woody stands still as stone. the postman takes a bow. even bill does a cross legged dip. knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes. woody watches his every move. mrs. thompson, one of the town's leaders, steps up. she's accompanied by crotchety old curmudgeon larry.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{the children have never heard shakespeare before.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{they still haven't.}
<A>__{the curmudgeon is still clapping.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thanks. you're very nice.}
<C>__{curmudgeon larry}
<D>__{i'm clapping because you stink.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't think you understand how it works.}
<C>__{curmudgeon larry}
<D>__{when i was young, i tried to be an actor. i was awful. but now i won't die thinking i was the worst one.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm glad i could help.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{larry, stop it.}
<P>__{(to the postman)}
<D>__{you were very good.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{good enough to get something to eat?}
<A>__{before she can answer, a sentry cries...}
<C>__{sentry}
<D>__{holnists! holnists are coming!}
<A>__{all eyes look down the road leading into town. a raiding party of holnist cavalry are on their way in. mrs. thompson sees the postman's concern.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{it's okay. we give them food and supplies. all the towns do. man #1 they hardly kill anyone lately. just take a woman sometimes.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{well, i'd just as soon not give them anything of mine. let's find the back door, bill.}
<A>__{the postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto bill. the forty holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in. they're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. some carry bows, knives, spear guns and swords. on their bare shoulders, branded into the flesh the number "8." out front, always leading by example is, general bethlehem. tough, smart, merciless with style. commander of the united clans of holn. nothing escapes his eye. a little behind him is the mysteriously silent colonel getty, second in command. the postman, finished packing, begins to move from building to building careful not to attract any attention.}
<C>__{bethlehem }
<D>__{what are you doing there?}
<A>__{the postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find bethlehem's not talking to him at all. the general looks down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game of "birnam wood." the children stop, stare at their feet. bethlehem affects a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i said, what are you doing?}
<A>__{meantime, the postman continues his surreptitious escape. the mayor hurries forward to greet bethlehem.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{it's just a game, general bethlehem. something they saw in a play. no harm in it.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{a play?}
<P>__{(to kids)}
<D>__{show me. it's all right, children, show me.}
<A>__{one brave boy finds his voice, barely.}
<C>__{brave boy}
<D>__{arm, arm yourselves! no running from the witches!}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{shakespeare, is it? well, i'm sorry i missed it.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{you should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{really? but you had time for a play?}
<A>__{head down, the postman makes for "the back way." but it's guarded by three daunting holnist soldiers. no getting by them. the postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he came. bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i'm taking three conscripts from each town. they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army until such time as i see fit.}
<P>__{(to mayor)}
<D>__{three men. you suppose you could do that?}
<A>__{the mayor nods in acquiescence. bethlehem looks to a holnist officer. the officer, idaho, steps up and addresses the town.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{all men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.}
<A>__{the holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or unwilling candidates forward. the postman is now walking behind bethlehem. some of the townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of town. three conscripts are hustled before bethlehem. he looks over the first woody. smells him. not much of a decision here.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{acceptable.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{acceptable, captain!}
<A>__{the second a thin teenager. bethlehem feels his arm, turns his head from side to side.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{you'll need to put some meat on, but i like an impressionable mind. acceptable.}
<A>__{the third an innocuous man. or so we think. bethlehem stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the bump on the man's nose.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{mongoloid. unacceptable.}
<A>__{soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. the brave boy that was playing birnam wood allows himself a tiny smile when he sees that the postman might make it.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i want pure blood. someone like...}
<A>__{bethlehem notes the boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots the postman leaving out the front gate.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{that man.}
<A>__{idaho and another soldier are on it. the postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you don't understand...}
<A>__{but idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for explanations they grab him.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{you were required to show yourself.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{but, i'm not with these people. i'm just passing through. i }
<A>__{idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head. everything falls out of focus}
<C>__{idaho }
<D>__{take the mule.}
