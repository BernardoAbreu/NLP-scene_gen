<L>__{interior madolyn's office. day}
<A>__{a clock ticking. madolyn is looking across at ...billy. madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. but no one's more guarded than billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's like confession. isn't it. this sort of thing.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{people make things up in confession. you know that?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i know they do.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{people are liars. they want to be stars of their little films.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{that's an interesting observation.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{do you lie?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{why do you?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm asking if you lie.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{honesty isn't synonymous with truth.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you lie. so, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{so, you had a parent who was a drunk?}
<A>__{madolyn looks up at him, transpierced. tables turned on the psychiatrist. billy smiles at her.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{let's keep this with you.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{there was a cop leaving when i came in.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{how do you know he was a cop?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. you see cops?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{that's part of what i do. although, i don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the academy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you should get a better job...}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{do they all come in and cry...your cops?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{let me tell you something. they signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. most of them. but they watch enough tv so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. no one's more full of shit than a cop. except a cop on tv.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i looked through your file and i see you have a record of assault. what was it like for you in jail?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you want to hear about the showers?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{did something happen to you?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you sit there with a mass murderer, your heart rate jacked, your hand...steady. that's one thing i found out about myself in prison. my hand doesn't shake, ever.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{what do you expect from coming here?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i have to come here.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i know it's not elective...on your part...but, now that you're here, what do you want?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you want the truth?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{valium.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{if you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what's that say about what you do for a living?}
<A>__{madolyn is taken aback. she closes her file.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{look, i think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.}
<A>__{she closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm having panic attacks. you didn't even ask about that. last night i thought i was having a fucking heart attack. i puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, i haven't slept for weeks.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{is this true?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yes. i said something true. i want some fucking pills and you close my file? i thought i was supposed to tell the truth here.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{yes, you are.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{if only fuckin' here.}
<A>__{she retrieves his folder.}
<C>__{billy }
<P>__{(giving into stress)}
<D>__{guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? you send him off to score smack on the fucking street?! (is that what you do, mrs.}
<P>__{fuckin' doctor?)}
<A>__{madolyn stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a small packet of two pills. she hands it over to him. billy looks at it.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{two pills.}
<A>__{she nods. billy reaches out and deliberately places the pills on the desk.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit?}
<A>__{madolyn is taken aback, guilty, astonished.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{you can leave!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what if that was a legitimate threat? (hot shot).}
<A>__{billy leaves. madolyn stares after him.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{fuck...}
