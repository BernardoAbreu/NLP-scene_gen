<L>__{exterior pier 26 early morning}
<A>__{a huge warehouse. sun coming up over the east bay, clarence teal rides up on a harley motorcyle, carrying a large cup of coffee to go. he enters the warehouse.}
<L>__{interior warehouse same}
<A>__{car and boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse.}
<L>__{interior watchman's quarters same}
<A>__{built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. korda is waiting behind the door as clarence enters. he seizes clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around. hot coffee soaks the front of clarence's shirt.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{if you weren't family i'd kill you.}
<A>__{clarence is scared. he offers no defense.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you told antonucci that shit came from me.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{so that we could get the best price. he's got respect for you. he's gonna try to lowball me, mike.}
<A>__{korda tosses clarence down onto the cot.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you fucking idiot! why do you think i use you?... to be a walking advertisement.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mike. i never heard of lamarra flipping on anyone before. he said he had the cops paid off. antonucci never flipped on anyone before. he had the cops paid off.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{what happened, mike.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<A>__{tears start to come to clarence's eyes.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mike.}
<A>__{clarence sincerely feels bad. it's kind of touching in a twisted way. korda moves over to the window to keep from striking clarence again. he looks off across the bay.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{god damn it! i still needed to case that fucking store. it's too risky to show my face now.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i got a couple thousand bucks. you could leave town.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{leave town? they're going to know me in fucking des moines now!...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{they got over ten million in jewels in that place. that's freedom, man. i could go anywhere i want.}
<A>__{clarence watches korda warily. things are beginning to add up in his head.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{did you kill him, mike?}
<A>__{korda turns to clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question. clarence is shaken by that. he starts to whimper again.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mike. i'm really sorry...}
<A>__{we're talking major fear here... korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs clarence's head against his chest.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{it's not your fault you're stupid.}
<A>__{tears of relief from clarence.}
