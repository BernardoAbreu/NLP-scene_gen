<A>__{"cold mountain" by anthony minghella based on the novel "cold mountain" by charles frazier}
<L>__{exterior cold mountain town, north carolina. day}
<A>__{on a black screen: credits. a raucous voice (swimmers) chanting in the cherokee language. a range of mountains slowly emerges: shrouded in a blue mist like a chinese water color. below them, close to a small town, young men, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack. their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack. a ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by inman, who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by swimmer, a young and lithe american indian. inman falls, clutching his nose. the ball bobbles on the ground in front of him. he grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose. his team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge. a pristine cabriolet pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town. it has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams. some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by. the driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister, monroe. and next to him, a self conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter, ada. inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at ada, astonished by her. an angel in this wild place. now swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into english:}
<C>__{swimmers voice }
<D>__{you will be lonely. you will howl like a dog as you walk alone. you will carry dog shit cupped in your hands. you will be smeared with dog shit. your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair...}
<A>__{as the cabriolet passes, swimmer takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. the game resumes. ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing.}
