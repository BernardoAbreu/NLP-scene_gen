<D>__{derek?}
<A>__{d erek looks over to where his pretty wife beth is standing beside the suv, holding their cute 2 year old son kyle in her arms. beth shakes her head with amusement.}

<D>__{you think he's right?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{hell, no. i think he's a hundred percent wrong. we haven't even gotten close to that point yet. hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. you know ganz. he gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. he started making auf wiedersehen noises but i managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil.}

<P>__{(pleased)}

<C>__{gage}
<D>__{remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?}

<C>__{derek}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{about derek charles being an asshole. they all say he's the nicest guy in the firm.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{and he's humble, too. i'm lisa, by the way. lisa sheridan.}

<D>__{actually, they're keeping me on a few more days, so i will probably see you on monday.}

<D>__{to the christmas party. it says "for employees only."}
<C>__{derek}

<A>__{lisa whirls around. beth is standing in the doorway, giving lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse. beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor. lisa is wide eyed, terrified, caught. lisa begins to edge her way around the room.}

<A>__{beth goes out into the hall and lisa springs on her. he two women fight, going up against the bannister. they claw and punch at each other. with renewed strength, lisa forces beth up against the bannister. beth looks over the side and down... fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table. lisa bangs beth against the bannister. a few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain. the bannister rail begins to crack. lisa tries to force beth over, then beth suddenly swings them around, reversing positions the bannister cracks, breaks apart and lisa topples over the side. as she's about to fall, lisa reaches out and grabs the chandelier with both hands. by a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to pull loose from it's ceiling mount. plaster cracks and rips away. lisa swings back and forth, dangling. beth stands on the landing. she looks at terrified lisa, then up at the ceiling mount. it won't take lisa's weight much longer. and both women know it. lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to beth who could pull her to safety.}

<D>__{listen to me. you have to let go right now.}
<A>__{and, trusting, lisa lets go. but so does beth!!! with a look of horror on her face, lisa falls through space. the soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion. down, down, down lisa falls. her arms and legs flop around like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air. the fall seems endless. then... lisa hits the glass dining table with her back. her whole body buckles. the surface of the table ripples. in slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around lisa, framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head. sound returns the sound of breaking glass and it's deafening. the table gives way and lisa lands hard on the marble floor, her skull cracking. her back is probably broken but she's still conscious. ying there, lisa stares up at beth on the landing as glass bounces and tinkles around her. the two enemies lock eyes. beth's face is impassive. lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak. and that's when the chandelier breaks loose. beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges downward and hits lisa in the chest with a radiantly beautiful shower of crystals. it kills her on impact. we come out of slow motion. real time resumes. on the landing, beth stares down at lisa's body, splayed under the chandelier like a broken doll. lisa's eyes are open but they're dead. beth, stoic, just stands there, looking down.}
