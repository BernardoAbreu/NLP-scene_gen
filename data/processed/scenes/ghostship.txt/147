<A>__{greer lies unconscious as epps looks on at him. the door comes open and murphy steps in.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{how's he doing?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{same. any luck?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{no. i will try again later.}
<A>__{a beat as they look on at greer.}

<A>__{murphy and epps sit at the galley table. epps reads the log book murphy found in the radio room.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(reading it)}
<D>__{they're dead in the water that morning. four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. and that evening they issue a general sos.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{possibly false. hence the ima record of being lost at sea. i don't think mutiny's out of the question here.}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(taking a seat)}
<D>__{on a passenger ship in 1953?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{if they knew what they were carrying.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're saying they mutinied for the gold?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{if they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{only something must've gone wrong.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, way wrong.}
<A>__{a beat as they consider it.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{so. i got a question. just from a, you know, purely technical standpointerior we call the coastguard. coastguard shows up. what exactly is the plan?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. about us. about those bodies. about the gold. seems like we oughta be prepared is all.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, well. the truth is one thing. when there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what do you propose?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{for starters, getting that gold off the ship. what they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.}
<A>__{a beat as murphy holds there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{there's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here. besides, it'll be safer where it is.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{with all due respect, skipper.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{part of that up there's mine. i'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.}
<A>__{a beat as murphy looks on.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{tell you what, dodge. once we get back to shore, you can do whatever you want with your share. but until then, the gold stays right where it is.}
<A>__{dodge holds there. he looks to epps a beat, takes a drink of coffee.}
