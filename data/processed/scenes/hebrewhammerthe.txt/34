<A>__{a handful of baaad brothers, decked out in a mixture of african clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of mellow blaxploitation music. 'kwanzaa now!' posters and other pro kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room, machine guns rest idly against sofas, blunts are passed around. we're talking black panthers here. a white accountant counts money at a card table to the side of the room. the black teenager enters breathlessly.}
<C>__{black teenager}
<D>__{hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor.}
<A>__{o.s., one of the baaad brothers inquires.}

<D>__{it's some pimped out hebrew dude in a caddy.}
<A>__{the men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and removing safeties. the front doors bust open, and we dolly into the hammer. all guns are trained on him. from behind the frontline of gunmen, mohammed, clearly the leader of the operation, pushes his way through. he walks towards the hammer. you can feel the tension in the room.}

<D>__{the hebrew hammer! my main kike!}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mohammed ali paula abdul rahim. my main nigga!}

<A>__{he points to the hammer.}

<D>__{well it's okay when we call each other that.}
<A>__{the white accountant thinks it over for a second.}
<C>__{white accountant}
<D>__{oh.}
