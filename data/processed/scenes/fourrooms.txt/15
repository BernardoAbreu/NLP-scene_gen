<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{hours later}
<A>__{athena reads from a huge leatherbound book, the book of shadows, full of potions and spells. four discouraged witches pack their bags. the room has been restored to its worldly under splendor. kiva uses the remote on the tv... so much for witchcraft. the slab of rock remains a slab.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i don't understand what went wrong.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{i say eva pulled one over on us.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{honey eva was wearing the face of someone just fucked good... and the best actress in this world, or any other, can't fake a thing like that!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{exactly if she was fucked so good, how could she save his come?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{it could be done...}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{girls, knock it off.}
<P>__{(she looks up from the book)}
<D>__{maybe... maybe it needed to be the sperm of a virgin male.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
<D>__{he was no virgin!}
<A>__{the witches sadly collect their things. athena, deep in thought, strokes the slab.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{let's leave her here, with the sword, until dawn. i will come back for her before checkout time. i just... feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her.}
<A>__{they all agree. they pick up their bags and head out.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<P>__{(cuddling her cat)}
<D>__{i can't believe we have to carry our own bags out! my mama would have a hissy fit!}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(flirtatiously)}
<D>__{i will carry your bags.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{you're carrying my bags!}
<A>__{they leave the room. jezebel's cat leaps from her arms as she hoists her luggage. eva walks out satisfied, thought perhaps a little sore "ouch," she says, and smiles. athena takes one last look at their goddess slab.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{next year, we try again with virgin sperm.}
<A>__{she closes the door on the honeymoon suite (till next new year's eve!).}
