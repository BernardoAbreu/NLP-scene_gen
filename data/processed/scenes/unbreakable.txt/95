<L>__{interior stadium locker room late morning}
<A>__{david dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into the players locker room. three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. one side of the room has benches and massage tables. the far end of the room has work out equipment. about twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost in their own pre game rituals. david watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and removes his dress shirt. his body is covered in old bruises. he lays down, wincing a bit from the pain. a trainer begins to massage him. david just stares at the battered athlete. his gaze moves across the room. beat. david stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it. he moves through the room of players and trainers. he moves to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone. david comes to a step at the foot of an olympic bench press. racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press. david looks down at the thick silver bar. three large black plates are on either side. six in all. david looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing. beat. he looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. some of the players have headphones on. some are staring into space. a couple are on cell phones... no one notices david dunne as he reaches for a forty five pound black plate off the weight rack. the huge disc slides onto the bar with almost no sound... a matching forty five pound disc goes on the other side... and then david adds another. he matches it on the other side... the bench creaks just the slightest bit as david takes a seat. no one notices the security guard lay back on the bench. david's hands take hold of the shiny bar. he closes his eyes... david's arms become tense. he pushes against the weight. it doesn't move. his face turns deep red. he opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps training. his face and arms are shaking... he keeps staring... focusing. and then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest. the weight hovers over david. he lowers it to his chest for a second time. his arms aren't shaking anymore. he pushes the weights back up. he carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. it touches down with the smallest of clinks. david's fingers uncurl from the bar. david lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.}

<A>__{beat. david sits up in a daze. he finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. some of the players have stood up. everyone stares as david dunne with the same quiet disbelief in their eyes.}
