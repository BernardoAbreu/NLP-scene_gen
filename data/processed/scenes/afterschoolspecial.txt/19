<L>__{interior video casa del russ a.k.a. russ's video magic day}
<A>__{fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and waves to russ, the scraggly owner of this small video rental store. fred passes j.t., mark, wendy, and kelly and a bunch of other customers on his way to the back section of the store.}
<B>__{adult section}
<A>__{fred makes sure russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno section. hurriedly, he pulls out "half cyborg 5: final showdown" from his book bag. but inside the case is the tape for "dirty darla #7." he makes the switch. fred sighs a breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult section...}

<D>__{aaaaaahhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{the customers stop to stare at the scene. fred breaks free, and russ chases after him.}
<C>__{russ}
<D>__{come back here, you bastard!}
<A>__{russ runs after him and dives at fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over. the tape fly everywhere. fred is still screaming. russ starts shouting at fred so that everyone can hear. a crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.}
<C>__{russ }
<D>__{what else you got in here?}
<A>__{russ rips open fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes. fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away. fred cringes as russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of moisty mate firming lotion, q tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves... wendy and kelly are completely grossed out.}
<C>__{russ }
<P>__{(totally confused)}
