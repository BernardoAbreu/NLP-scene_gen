<L>__{interior cafe}
<A>__{as they enter the cafe, the counterman looks up from counting the day's take at the far end.}
<C>__{counterman}
<D>__{too late for service.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{just two cups of java.}
<C>__{counterman}
<P>__{(with a twinkle)}
<D>__{we serve here only moka coffee.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(smiling faintly)}
<D>__{make it moke.}
<A>__{the counterman goes to the urn for the coffee.}
<B>__{susan and steve}
<A>__{a closer angle. they talk in quiet undertones. steve waits for her to speak first; she starts slowly, hesitantly, with difficulty:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...i couldn't go all the way...i failed you...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{will you forgive me?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{have i lost you, steve? have i...?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, maybe i was wrong, too... but there's no doubt, susie, that we have to face some serious things...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(quietly, to the point)}
<D>__{but you didn't do much about it, susie. you walked out, and there i was...solo...and not too good at that.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i just didn't think that i could antagonize him, steve for our sake, i mean.}
<B>__{steve}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{susie, i was there for our sake, too. but what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa! by the way, i think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{this accusation is made lightly, in passing. but susan reacts to it, trying to interject:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{steve, i...}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(overriding her)}
<D>__{but i don't care about that now. he knew what he was doing today. he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage if i would bend to every whim of his, like sidney! i couldn't do that, susie...}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{after a pause, she says:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're saying goodbye, aren't you?}
<B>__{susan and steve}
<A>__{steve flares up.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no! i'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(wrenched)}
<D>__{but, please, steve, please one step at a time! i was born only yesterday!...}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(pausing, softer)}
<D>__{i told your brother i couldn't be his accomplice. i can't be yours either, susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you. i know what type he's my old man all over again!}
<A>__{susan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her coffee cup, which she has not touched. the coat slips from her shoulders...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{steve stoops to pick it up, replaces it on her shoulders.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{this beautiful coat is more than just a coat... i hate it! it's a mink straight jacket!}
<A>__{susan turns to him. she is deflated, lacking all will power.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(drooping)}
<D>__{steve, i feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(not sure of himself)}
<D>__{not what you're doing now. at least don't ask me don't ask him. you're fighting for your life! what do you want to do?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(pausing, woodenly)}
<D>__{you are saying goodbye, aren't you...?}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{he reacts vigorously, protesting:}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{that's fish four days old...! i can't buy it, susie! right out of that mouth i love, like you're a ventriloquist's dummy, your brother is saying goodbye! gee!...you want me to be honest, don't you?!}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{a despairing cry:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, steve, i don't. i don't. not if it kills me i don't!...}
<B>__{susan and steve}
<A>__{it takes her a moment to recover. when she does so, she gets up, leaving the counter.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(without luster)}
<D>__{let's not talk any more...you have to go...}
<A>__{she moves towards the exit into the hallway; he follows.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{d'angelo is waiting for them. silently they come up to join him, very depressed. susan looks towards d'angelo, speaks a little pathetically:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. d'angelo. take care of steve.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i will, miss hunsecker.}
<A>__{he walks a little way down the corridor, again leaving them alone.}
<B>__{susan and steve}
<A>__{she smiles at him, trying to smile, trying to make a joke.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{say something funny...mr. hasenfeffer.}
<A>__{steve steps to her quickly, kisses her. then he turns and swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward glance. he goes past d'angelo, who walks quietly after him towards the exit in background.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{she remains just in the attitude in which he left her.}
