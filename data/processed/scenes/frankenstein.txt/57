<L>__{int victor's garret night}
<A>__{tracking slowly past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we find victor performing an intense chemical analysis. dead tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a slow burning flame. victor smears a glass slide, places it under a microscope.}
<L>__{int gasthof day}
<A>__{victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. henry is across from him:}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{victor. this has got to stop.}
<P>__{(victor glances up)}
<D>__{nobody's seen you in months. you haven't attended a single class.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i've been preoccupied.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we all know how hard you took waldman's death. even krempe is sympathetic. but it is time to move on. it is time to concern yourself with life.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{that is my concern.}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{i'm involved in something just now. i want to finish it in waldman's memory.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{how much longer?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{few months perhaps. i'm gathering the raw materials even now.}
