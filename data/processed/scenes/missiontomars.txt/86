<A>__{woody floats above the repaired hole, scanning the nearby surface of the hull.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{jim, there's a lot of scarring... i'd better check for other punctures while i'm out here.}
<C>__{mcconnell }
<D>__{negative, negative. woody, get back inside. we've gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion.}

<D>__{copy, i'm heading there now.}

<B>__{we move in closer}
<A>__{on one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of the eraser at the end of a pencil. so small, so apparently harmless...}
