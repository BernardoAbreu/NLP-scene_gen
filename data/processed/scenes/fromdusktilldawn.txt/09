<B>__{fort stockton}
<L>__{238 miles from the mexican border interior emma and pete's gravy train day}
<A>__{emma and pete's patrons are made up of regulars, truckers, cowboys and road weary travelers. the camera dollies through the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses. it stops when it gets to a table occupied by the fuller family. the fullers definitely fall into the road weary category. the members of the unit consist of the father, jacob, age 44, an ex preacher, a good man with rough edges, and his two children, kate, age 19, is a young beauty who possesses what can only be described as an apple pie sensuality. she is dressed like a nice christian girl, complete with crucifix. scott, age 16, is a jacob's vietnamese adopted son. scott is a likable, long haired kid who always wears a t shirt with the name of the heavy metal garage band he plays guitar for, "precinct 13." the three of them are wolfing down a late lunch.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we got about two more hours of day light left. that'll get us into el paso, which is right next to the border. we'll stop at a motel }
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{stop? we're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?}
<A>__{scott and kate speak together, obviously repeating something that jacob has said about three hundred times.}
<C>__{scott and kate}
<D>__{we've got a winnebago. we don't need those over priced roach havens. we're self contained.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, okay, maybe i was a little overzealous, but give me a break, i just bought it.}
<A>__{scott and kate continue the impersonation.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{why, just look at all this. you got your kitchen }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ you got your microwave }
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ you got your sink }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ you got your shower }
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ see this, television!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{feel this, real wood paneling. that's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{the truth hurts.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to scott)}
<D>__{it's the bitterest of pills.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you two ought to start a stand up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ain't it the truth.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{why do you want to stop?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm exhausted.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{lie in the back, dad, i will drive us into mexico.}
<A>__{jacob gives scott a look that says, "you aren't touching my new motor home."}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i just bet you would. don't even thin about it. besides, i want to have one night's sleep in an honest to goodness bed. the beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i will be right back. i'm gonna go to the bathroom.}
<A>__{scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the restroom. jacob and kate are left alone. there's an awkward moment of silence before...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dad, when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist. mr.franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. he said when we come home, if you still feel the same way }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's very nice of ted, but i will call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i didn't want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset. but you don't believe in god anymore?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{not enough to be a pastor. look, i know this is hard on you kids. after jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. but i can't do it any longer. my congregation needs spiritual leadership. well, they can't get that from me anymore. my faith is gone. to answer your question, yes, i do believe in jesus. but do i love them? no. after jenny died, i just thought, what's the point?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(pushing him)}
<D>__{it's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. for twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. and then one day you wake up and say fuck him?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i didn't say fuck him. i'm just not connected anymore.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that happens, you'll get it back.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{kate, give your old man a little credit. every person who chooses the service of god as their life's work has something in common. i don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a buddhist monk. many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am i a fool? we've all done it. i'm not going through a lapse. what i've experienced is closer to awakening. i'm not trying to shake your faith. i've just decided not to devote my life to god anymore.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what do you think mom would say?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.}
