<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay stands at the screen door.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{come in, mr. boone.}
<A>__{whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers. he gestures at a wooden armchair across from him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my workshop, my studio. hardly somewhere in which a sweaty workman should feel out of place.}
<A>__{clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and stacked in the corners.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{these are your paintings?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what? oh yes.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{excuse me, but are you famous?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you know what they say. if you have to ask }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm just a hick who cuts lawns. but some of these look familiar.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{they were familiar when i painted them. that one's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. and that's a rembrandt.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{they're just copies then. gotcha.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but before i retired, you might say i had a brief time in the sun. fame, as it were. tell me, do you like motion pictures?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sure, everybody does. when i was a kid i'd go with my sister twice a week. why? were you an actor or something?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in my youth, yes, but never in hollywood. no, i was merely a director here.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah? what were some of your movies?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{this and that. the only ones you maybe have heard of are the "frankenstein" pictures.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{clay sits up, surprised, skeptical and impressed all at once.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{"frankenstein" and "bride of" and "son of" and all the rest?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i made only the first two. the others were done by hacks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{still. you must be rich. making a couple of famous movies like those.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{merely comfortable. here's hanna with our refreshments. can you get the door?}
<A>__{clay jumps up to open the screen door. hanna walks past, refusing to look at him. she sets the tray on a table very hard, ringing the glasses and silverware.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{how are you feeling, mr. jimmy? how is your mind today?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my mind's lovely. and yours?}
<A>__{hanna flares her nostrils at him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you remember what the doctor tells us.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes. i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea. we'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i am not forgetting your last brief chat.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just go. we can manage without you.}
<A>__{hanna stares up at clay.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{he looks plenty big. you won't need my help if anything goes flooey.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and marches out the door. clay returns to his chair and sits down again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{when they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.}
<P>__{(smiles at clay)}
<D>__{please, mr. boone. help yourself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what did she mean by going flooey?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i returned recently from a stay in hospital.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what was wrong?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{nothing serious. a touch of stroke.}
<A>__{clay nods, chugs his tea. when he lowers the glass, he finds the old man watching him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you must excuse me for staring, mr. boone. but you have a marvelous head.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{to an artistic eye, you understand. have you ever modeled?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean, like posed for pictures?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{sat for an artist. been sketched.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{what's to sketch?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you have the most architectural skull. and your nose. very expressive.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{broke is more like it.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but expressively broken. how did it happen?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{football in college.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you went to university?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just a year. i dropped out to join the marines.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. you were a marine.}
<A>__{whale's gaze deepens. he laughs lightly.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i apologize for going on like this. it's the sunday painter in me. of course i can understand your refusal. it's a great deal to ask of someone.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean you really want to draw me?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{indeed. i'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and it's just my head you want? nothing else?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what are you suggesting? you'll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i have no interest in your body, mr. boone. i can assure you of that.}
<A>__{clay takes a moment to size up whale whose innocent, slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right then. sure. i could use the extra dough.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{excellent. we'll have a most interesting time.}
<A>__{whale lifts his glass, takes a small sip of tea.}
