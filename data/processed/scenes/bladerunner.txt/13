<L>__{interior leon's hotel corridor night}
<A>__{the companion ways below deck of a big ship are no more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and outs of this establishment. but deckard finds the door he's looking for. he pauses a moment, listens, then knocks. he inserts the key and with a hand on his gun opens it.}
<L>__{interior leon's room night}
<A>__{an empty room. a cot and not much else. he steps in and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs. for a place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly clean. spartan in fact. the towel by the spotless basin is perfectly folded. deckard runs two fingers over a shelf. no dust. he looks in the waste basket. wadded up candy wrappers. the bed by the window is neatly made. deckard looks under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress. the closet. there's one suit in it. he pats it down. nothing. a show box on the floor. he stoops, takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care fully traces it over the box. assured of its harm lessness, he lifts off the lid. it contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band. deckard removes them, goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on. a touching collection of family snapshots. the kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops. the family dog. junior on the pony squinting in the sun. uncle ben clowning with the kids. the faded polaroid of christmas morning. simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond. a curious collection for the likes of leon and deckard studies them with interest.}
