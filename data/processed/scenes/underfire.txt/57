<A>__{the three sandinistas, pedro, claire, and price emerge. a woman, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. the six crawl so as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to survey the plaza.}

<A>__{half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. otherwise, it is empty. p.o.v. six guardia snipers in the church tower control the plaza. as we watch, they fire off occasional shots in different directions there is no way to cross the plaza. the woman pulls a tray of "contact bombs" from the oven, home made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. pedro grabs one and pretends to bite into it. the sandinistas start to laugh and catch themselves as pedro clowns. claire and price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond; mostly they are on edge. the contact bombs are put in a sack. the woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of them climb down a ladder into a tunnel.}
