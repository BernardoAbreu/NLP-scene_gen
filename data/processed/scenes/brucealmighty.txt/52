<L>__{exterior warehouse day}
<A>__{an old building on the outskirts of town. a faded sign painted on the wall reads, omni presents. bruce's demolished car enters frame. he studies the area and building suspiciously. bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, steps in a puddle. he sinks up to his knee.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{he gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.}
<L>__{interior omni presents day}
<A>__{bruce enters and checks the building directory. it reads:}
<B>__{omni presents unltd.}
<A>__{pers onnel rm. 7 ac coun ting rm. 7 security rm . 7 creativ e rm. 7}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you're looking for room 7.}
<A>__{bruce turns to see a janitor mopping the floor. he looks at bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{want me to even those up for you?}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(feigns a smile)}
<D>__{how would i get to room 7?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{that'd be on the seventh floor. stairs are right over there.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what about the elevator?}
<A>__{he points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{out of order.}
<A>__{bruce heads for the stairs.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{you mind giving me a hand with this floor?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what? yeah, i mind.}
<A>__{he continues on.}
<B>__{seventh floor}
<A>__{the stairwell door opens up to a large room with a single desk at the end of an otherwise empty space. bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending into a hole in the ceiling.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{excuse me. hello. i'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this jointerior..}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{be right with y.a, just fixin' a light. tell me if it's working?}
<A>__{click and an insanely bright white light illuminates, shining down blinding bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yep, seems to be.}
<P>__{(wiping his eyes)}
<D>__{kinda bright, though.}
<A>__{an electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the ladder.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{yeah, it is for most people. they spend their lives in the dark...}
<A>__{as he talks he steps down next to bruce and we see that it is the same janitor.}
<C>__{janitor }
<D>__{. . . thinkin' they can hide from me.}
<A>__{the two stand, angelically illuminated. bruce tries to put everything together.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, the elevator's broken, huh?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{yeah, but i will get around to it.}
<A>__{the janitor claps his hands twice and the light goes off.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you installed a clapper?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{nope. catchy jingle, though.}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{clap on. clap off. clap on, clap off. the clapper.}
<P>__{(claps twice)}
<D>__{you can't get it out of your head.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{okay, but the boss'11 be right out.}
<A>__{the janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit. he extends his hand to bruce.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{you must be bruce. i've been expecting you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, this is hilarious. so you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{nothin' wrong with rollin' up your sleeves, son. people underestimate the benefits of good 'ol manual labor. there's freedom in it. happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end of the day.}
<A>__{he strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{your father knew that. he was a damn good welder.}
<A>__{bruce approaches the desk.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{how do you know my father? and how did you get my pager number?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{oh, i know a lot about you bruce. pretty much everything there is to know. everything you've ever said, done or thought about doin', is right there in that file cabinet.}
<A>__{he points out a single drawer file cabinet.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{wow, a whole drawer. just for me? mind if i take a look?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{it's your life.}
<A>__{bruce pulls the drawer and it flies open, dragging him the full length of the room the janitor casually pulls a file.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{now this last entry was a little disturbing.}
<A>__{he thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer dramatically sucks closed, dragging bruce back. the janitor reads from the file.}
<C>__{janitor}
<P>__{(reads, scanning)}
<D>__{thanks for everything, lord.}
<C>__{janitor }
<D>__{i am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan.. the gloves are off, pal.. smite me oh mighty smiter.}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{i'm not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh. oh, and let's not forget "what kind of a god would let this happen? i mean, have you seen then news lately?"}
<A>__{bruce stands, dazed.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{i'm the creator of the heavens and the earth. i'm the alpha & omega. the first and the last.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sorry, it's not ringing a bell. janitor god i'm god, bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, you're god. well that explains everything1 that's how you know everything about me. that's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly.}
<P>__{(placating)}
<D>__{well, it's really nice to meet you. thanks for the grand canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse.}
<A>__{bruce turns to leave, but finds himself walking right toward god and his desk. he tries again, and again.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay, i don't know how you're doing that, but i really gotta go. this place is obviously rigged in some way. we're on some freaky hidden camera show.}
<P>__{(playing to the "cameras")}
<D>__{...for which i will not sign a release, by the way! but you know what, i'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{everyone with a brain in their head would know that the drawer is being fed through the wall from behind bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a normal back.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay. that's good. that's a good one. bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay, god. how many fingers am i holding out? bruce extends three fingers.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{three. he quickly pulls one finger in.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{two. bruce begins switching fingers rapidly. god doesn't miss a beat.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{four. nine. six. eight. one... one final attempt, bruce holds seven fingers.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay, how about now. he quickly pulls in two fingers.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{seven. .bruce ah hal bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended fingers to god, then immediately notices he has seven fingers on his one hand.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{aaahhhl}
<A>__{he shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers disappear. god approaches bruce.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{you've been doing a lot of complaining about me, bruce. and quite frankly, i'm tired of it...}
<A>__{bruce backs away from god.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you stay away from me! i don't know what your doing. but whatever you're doing is probably actionable!}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{well, that's not very neighborly. i brought you here to offer you a job.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{job? wh at job?}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{my job. you think you can do it better, so here's your chance. when you leave this building you will be endowed with all my powers.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sure, whatever you say, pal.}
<A>__{he turns to go but god stands before him in the janitor uniform, holding the mop.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{all the power of god.}
<A>__{bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and god the janitor has also vanished. a beat, then bruce sprints out of the room.}
