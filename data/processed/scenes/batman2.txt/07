<L>__{exterior entrance to park that moment night}
<A>__{brakes squeal. several squad cars are now massed at the entrance to the park but there's one problem. the city's snow plows don't operate on the park roads and the entrance is blocked off with sawhorses reading "closed to traffic." a huge steep drift prevents them from entering and so all they can do is stand by helplessly, watching as the snowmobiles vanish into the trees. the cops race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct a plan. a couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls of the park. another is at his car, barking into a radio mike:}
<C>__{cop with mike}
<D>__{yeah, you heard me. snowmobiles!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so what do we do? chase 'em on foot??}
<A>__{all eyes turn at the blare of a horn. the cops peer down the long corridor of the cross street and see a strange black vehicle barreling toward them at 90 mph, with no intention of stopping... the batmobile!! cops dive left and right. a split second later... ...a forty foot jet of nova intensity flame erupts from the front of the jet black supercar instantaneously dissolving the drift that blocks the entrance to the park turning the ice and snow on the paths before it into water! the batmobile screams past in the wink of an eye. the cops get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating. one of them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:}
<C>__{cop i}
<D>__{...that was batman.}
<C>__{cop ii}
<D>__{no shit!!}
<A>__{cop ii yanks cop i into the nearest squad car, and the others follow suit. engines rev. as long as the batmobile's cleared a path, they might as well join in the chase...}
