CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog. CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily.}

Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor.}

<ACTION>__{As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly.}

<ACTION>__{Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.}
