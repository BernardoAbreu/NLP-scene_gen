<A>__{a bunch of biker types are cooking up a vat of speed. these guys are big, and badasslooking. after a beat, one of the bikers looks up at the door.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{did you hear something?}
<A>__{the other biker shakes his head, no. the one who asked the question walks over to the door and listens for a beat. nothing. he turns to go back and suddenly the door disintegrates in front of a charging man wearing a "police" windbreaker. this is daniel bateman, a big, young, psychotic cop, who immediately runs over the poor biker who was listening at the door, kicking the guy in the head as he goes by. bateman dives on two more bikers, and viciously head butts one of them. he stuffs the other's head into the meth mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack, three quick times: rap! rap! rap! the guy goes down like lead. bateman looks around and spots a big biker cowering in a corner. the biker is terrified. bateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more cops wearing windbreakers run in, out of breath. they look around at the unconscious bikers.}
<D>__{cop #1 jesus, bateman! why don't you ever wait for us?!}
<A>__{beep! beep! beep! someone's beeper is going off. the three cops look at theirs. nothing. the cowering biker looks at his.}
