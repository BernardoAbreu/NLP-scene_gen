<L>__{interior white dome tent night}
<A>__{high wide angle over mulder and scully, staring up just past camera at the louvered vents at top center of the tent. when a loud metallic noise makes them jump.}
<B>__{agents pov the louvered vents above them}
<A>__{one of the vents is opening automatically, its large metal louvers straining from their flat closed position into an up and down open position. when this is complete, the second louver does the same. the straining sound of galvanized metal on metal.}
<B>__{low angle on mulder and scully}
<A>__{as mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to the mysterious box they're standing next to. something occurs to him. something frightening.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully....?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{yeah...?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{run.}
<A>__{mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. though she doesn't know why. or what's about to happen. tracking fast with them as mulder leads her back toward the door they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(yelling, on the run)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(yelling back)}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{when the louvered vents on all the low grid arranged boxes open in domino like succession out of them pouring thousands and thousands of bees, rapidly filling the atmosphere of the domed space. as if the insects are being shot out of non stop cannons.}
<B>__{high angle}
<A>__{thick streams of bees head right at camera, flying for the open louvers at the top of the dome. as mulder and scully run for it down below.}
<B>__{tracking with mulder and scully}
<A>__{scully's hand slipping from mulder's as she pulls her jacket up over her head. mulder doing the same now, ducking his head inside his own jacket. the agents are slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way toward the door bees clinging to their clothes. but motion seems to be the key. as mulder runs toward camera where the downward blast of air knocks all the bees off him. in the b.g., we see that scully has fallen behind. still running, but losing her way in the process, losing her bearings as the thickening swarm of bees descends.}
<B>__{close on scully}
<A>__{when mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head again. taking scully by the back of her coat and swinging her toward the direction of the door. whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the doorfans. following right behind her as the fans blasting them and the agents continue right out the doors. to:}
