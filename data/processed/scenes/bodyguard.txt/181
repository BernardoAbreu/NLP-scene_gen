<A>__{rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding drive, followed by a black mercedes limousine. behind the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent gathered outside, held back by a large number of police and security guards. a light drizzle is falling. the two cars pull up to the entrance, henry at the wheel of rachel's. frank gets out of the front and opens the back door. devaney and spector help rachel and fletcher out of the car. they are all dressed in black. a few other mourners, including emma, get out of the mercedes. rachel, red eyed and weary, takes fletcher under her arm and goes inside. she does not look at frank.}
