<A>__{an assistant opens the door and a middle aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and joan crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar. she begins to sing a folk song, very sincerely, in a very off key monotone. it's unbearable and depressing. barris glances over at the executive; she's checking her watch again. the song is endless. barris's eyes grow cloudy.}
