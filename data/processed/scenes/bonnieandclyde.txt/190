<A>__{she starts to her feet, then adjusts to his presence. she is a bit panicked. blanche is now a defeated human being. her voice and manner bespeak great weariness, sorrow and still a touch of her old high strung hysteria. but most of that is gone now, like everything else that was really vital in her life.}
