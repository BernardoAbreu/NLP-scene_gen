<L>__{interior storm cellar continuous}
<A>__{the group stoops low as they descend the stairs. beneath wood supports, the dirt is reclaiming it, already a constant trickle of dirty falling from between the boards. in the dim, patrick leads them, walking through a mass of spider infested webs and, just ahead, is the sub basement where they originally found the body.}
<L>__{interior sub basement continuous}
<A>__{throwing debris aside, they come next through a small door at the bottom of the stairs and enter the sub basement. nearby is the elevator shaft, a gaping hole in the ruins but recognizable as such. the ceiling above them is nearly collapsed, and over most of the room, the accumulated debris and ruin from above has simply fallen through. and what remains of the ceiling is still shifting, groaning, coming apart. patrick shines his flashlight down to the ground, until:}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he's found the hole that was bones' hastily dug grave, but there's nothing in it now but swarming white maggots.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{is it there?}
<A>__{she gets down on her hands and knees as patrick shines the light, but after a few frantic moments of digging, it's clear:}
<C>__{pearl }
<D>__{it's gone. he got it.}
<A>__{just then the sound of tremendous strain and creaking of wood. and the ceiling starts to give way. they all scramble for shelter, and then it gives way completely completely blocking their way out. they're trapped.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no!!!!!!}
<A>__{they all look in every direction for some glimpse of hope of a way out. there is none. then they hear behind them: a resonant "ding!" turning their pov where moments before there was a gaping, ruined elevator shaft, there is now a fully functioning elevator just as it was in 1979, the doors opening to them in eerie slo mo. pearl starts towards the open car. the others trying to hold her back.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{it's alright. let me.}
<A>__{she walks closer, peering into the dark recesses of the elevator. maybe again a flash of visible movement inside. closer ever closer, until pearl, almost entranced, steps in. and once inside, there's no one, or no thing, there. pearl is about to tell them "it's okay..." when suddenly the doors of the elevator slide slam shut.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{mama!!!!!}
<A>__{then they hear the elevator chain start to move and the elevator starts to rise. cinnabar screaming louder.}
