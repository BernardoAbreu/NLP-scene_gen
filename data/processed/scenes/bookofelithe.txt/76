<A>__{they keep on along the road. a shallow uphill incline. they follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop and take in the view before them. the pacific ocean. straddled by the golden gate bridge the once great structure has partially collapsed from decades of neglect and disrepair. the span sags and hangs low over the ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured. on the other side of the bay, san francisco or the little that remains of it. the city has been almost totally destroyed entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings still standing looking on the verge of collapse. solara looks at it all in horrified awe. eli, unperturbed, keeps on moving, still clutching his side.}
