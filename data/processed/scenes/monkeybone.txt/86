<L>__{exterior hallway a moment later}
<A>__{julie helps a punchdrunk, staggering stu to the stairway.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{how was it? i don't recall.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it was great, baby. let's get you to the er.}
<A>__{as they pass, buster lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind his gate. hold on the dog's satisfied expression as stu bone loses his balance and topples down the stairs o.s.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior dungeon night}
<A>__{rasputin, atilla, jack the ripper and stephen king are engrossed in their weekly parcheesi game. stu is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his fate.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm not like the rest of you. i'm just a regular guy! i'm not a "nightmare maker."}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{neither are we. we got our bodies hijacked just like you. the guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers!}
<C>__{attila}
<D>__{like me. i was a mess sergeant in the mongol horde. i never wanted to be the scourge of asia. i just wanted a new recipe for yak!}
<C>__{jack the ripper}
<D>__{i was jack the haberdasher.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{but how? did you all have sidekicks? figments? ...monkeys??}
<C>__{stephen king}
<D>__{hey, i got screwed over by my own dog. go through hell to get that e ticket, and who winds up in my body? that darn cujo.}
<A>__{typhoid mary runs past, giggling, pursued by a huffing hitchcock.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{he's sure got a thing for those icy blondes.}
<A>__{kazoos sound. the rat guard appears to announce:}
<C>__{rat guard}
<D>__{miley. you got a visitor.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{...kitty?!?}
<A>__{at the sight of stu behind bars, she breaks down crying.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, stu. i wanted to tell you what was going on. i really, really liked you.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{kitty...my situation is really not important. the thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{you're such a beautiful man. look at you stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{listen to me! is there any way i can warn her what monkeybone is up to??}
<C>__{rat guard}
<D>__{time's up! break it up, you two.}
<A>__{the rat guard pushes stu back with a prod. kitty reaches out...}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{no! give me a moment. just to look at him. oh, stu. oh, my sweet, sweet stu.}
<A>__{as she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead panel opens and a deluge of crud from the morpheum lands directly on stu.}
<C>__{rat guard}
<D>__{feeding time!}
<A>__{kitty bawls inconsolably as the rat guard leads her away.}
