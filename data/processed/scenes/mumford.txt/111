<L>__{interior skip's workshop day}
<A>__{mumford and skip enter the large, windowless workspace. what at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. many different disciplines interface here: the body section: the first thing one notices some incredibly life like, anatomically correct, sculpture mannequins both male and female. you half expect them to breathe. from there, a full wall of forms descends from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a huge variety of inflatable sex dolls. the cyber section: a dizzying array of computers and screens, some showing wire form outlines of body parts in repeated motion. above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs. the body parts section: medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, limbs. hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia. the form casting shop: all the machinery you need to make rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer designed. all these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high tech work surfaces. skip watches mumford move about in awe, picking up the odd item.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{pretty creepy, huh? are you totally disgusted?}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{("no")}
<D>__{skip, you're a visionary. that can be a burden.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{this doesn't seem a little... perverse?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{there are a lot of lonely people in the world. somebody's gonna figure this out someday.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's not going to be me. i'm giving it up.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's all your fault. in the last 48 hours, i've completely lost interest.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what'd i do?}
<A>__{skip looks at mumford, a wide grin on his face.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{lily.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lily...}
<P>__{(gets it)}
<D>__{...skip, that's great! you and lily.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{oh, she doesn't know about it yet. right now, of the two of us, i'm the only one in love. but i'm very stoked.}
<A>__{skip settles in front of the body parts section, framed by an array of limbs and sex toys. there's an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc, how i can be of help to you?}
<A>__{skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button. the pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place. it's amazingly life like, but it makes a mechanical whirring sound. skip fumbles to turn it off.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{sorry...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to mumford.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i'm here for you, doc.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{skip, you know that it's improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i guess that makes sense.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes, yes it does...}
<A>__{mumford sinks into silence. he begins to wander the room.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you've fallen in love with one of your patients?}
<A>__{mumford nods. skip is desperate to say something useful. suddenly, he has an alarming thought.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc!... it's not me, is it?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{mumford understands and can't stop a laugh.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{no, skip, it's not you. but i like you a lot.}
<A>__{skip is relieved. he has another thought and brightens.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc, what about this? you're not really a licensed psychologist!}
<A>__{mumford turns to meet skip's gaze. skip realizes the ramifications of what he's just said.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{hmm. i guess that doesn't help... i see where you're going here. it's a mess.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yep.}
