<L>__{interior another room, dymshitz's office suite night}
<A>__{german modern paintings stacked untidily. dymshitz, carrying a vodka bottle and his glass, shows steve the paintings. steve, too, has a glass.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! i put that to him, he couldn't answer. why didn't he go and direct in america, like that italian, toscanini.}
<A>__{dymshitz pours vodkas, raises his glass, drinks. so does steve. now, their moods swing with the drink. dymshitz drinks; then sits, sinks into his own world.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<P>__{(lost for a moment)}
<D>__{perhaps... perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important, things like an orchestra, a school. that's his country. maybe he has an old mother who can't be left alone. maybe he has brothers, sisters... you can't...}
<A>__{a forlorn look at steve. his eyes are misty, he is visibly drunk.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(a wry smile)}
<D>__{colonel. he had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{anyway, major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? why?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but what... before that turns rotten... what if they surround the space with barbed wire, colonel?}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<P>__{(suddenly exploding)}
<D>__{don't talk about things you know nothing about. he was in a dictatorship!}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, i heard all about that.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{in a dictatorship, art belongs to the party. if you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{this is what i'm saying. he must have had party contacts.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{there are good party members who help, and there are dirty non party members who inform on you. of course, they gave him privileges.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{and suddenly, steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. they honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what museum?}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{i'm sorry. museum? not... i said orchestra. sorry. believe me.}
<P>__{(another sudden}
<D>__{change of mood to}
<P>__{earnest, intimate)}
<D>__{help me, steve. you say you answer for someone from high up. i, too, have orders from high up. very high up. we want furtwangler. i will give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. i need him, steve.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no can do.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{let furtwangler go. please.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i have a duty.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{duty? i am sorry, duty? duty fucking duty. trouble is, you americans want everybody to live like you. we liberated berlin, major steve, not you. our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture.}
<A>__{dymshitz bursts out laughing. stung, steve advances on him, almost as if he's about to attack him physically. he stops, sways a little, then, after a moment, drops down in a chair near to dymshitz. they drink. intimate:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, colonel. no deal. no fucking deal.}
<C>__{dymshitz}
<D>__{then you're going to kill me.}
