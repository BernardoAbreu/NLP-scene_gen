<A>__{long shot angled through gate in barbed wire fence. the ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the sierras. green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around the house, which stands in a clump of trees. the wind has pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is still thunder. the gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. it is closed. on the fence post a board is tacked. neatly lettered on the board is the name:}
<C>__{ed wyatt}
<A>__{from o.s. comes the sound of horses moving restlessly and the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the saddle. footsteps approach. a man's head and shoulders, back to camera, comes into scene. he unloops the strand of bailing wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his face. he is lednov. his cheek and jowls have a dark growth of beard. he wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's grey hat. the clothes forster was wearing. as he moves back to his horse, camera pulls back and pans around. his companions, mccall and peters, also wear black leather jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. they are mounted on matched roans. the horses are winded, lathered and dirty. it is obvious they have ridden hard. lednov strides forward and as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. brutally he jerks on the reins. the horse rears. he snatches his hat from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. mccall rides over and grabs the reins. lednov scrambles into the saddle.}
