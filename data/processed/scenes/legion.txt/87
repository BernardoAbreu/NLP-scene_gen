<A>__{he pulls back from michael, raising the mace sching! long deadly sharp spikes bursts from all its sides...as if it wasn't bad ass enough. and the fight begins. it's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems under gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior weapon. with the aid of his wings, gabriel moves with staggering speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. the place is getting absolutely shot to hell. michael leaps from table top to table top as gabriel brings the mace brutally down splintering everything it touches. michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top spins to fire. gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of michael's mp5. the gun explodes in michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter. gabriel swoops in fast. michael kicks him in the chest, sending him fluttering back. michael thrusts himself to his feet. gabriel recovers, jabs again. michael grabs a hold of bob's ceiling mounted tv for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike. michael kicks gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him. michael dives at gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches. gabriel is rattled back by the assault. he clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it. michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall. michael smashes down on gabriel's wrist, cracking the bones. a swift kick to the chest and gabriel is thrust crashing back, losing his grip on the weapon. michael takes a running leap onto gabriel's back. gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw michael off. they hit the ceiling, but michael hangs on. choking the life out of gabriel.}
