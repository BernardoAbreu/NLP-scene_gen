<L>__{exterior supply room day}
<B>__{medium shot featuring leva}
<A>__{he is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail. but he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial.}
<L>__{exterior roof of barracks day}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{as before, pandemonium but controlled and efficient. the men are hoarse from shouting, red eyed, puffing from excitement and exertion. two jap planes swoop past and the full throated umbrella of fire lets loose. lieutenant ross clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the bar and loading clips. the men greet him with a concerted cheer.}
<B>__{two shot lieutenant ross and warden}
<A>__{ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps warden on the shoulder.}
<C>__{dhom's voice}
<D>__{here they come, men!}
<A>__{sound of jap planes comes up ear splitting loud. ross drops down behind a chimney, swings his bar, fires. camera moves to include karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the machine gun. two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the tripod. two jap planes pass in b.g. of shot, zoom off into the sky.}
<C>__{karelsen}
<P>__{(disgustedly)}
<D>__{nuts! led him too tar.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{as the men on the roof reload. in the distance the jap planes have turned and are heading back for the roof.}

<B>__{close shot flash choate}
<A>__{singing as he fires.}
<B>__{close shot karelsen}
<A>__{firing the machine gun. he yanks the tripod away from his helpers, picks up the gun, stands and swings it after the plane. the recoil staggers him half way across the roof and deposits him on his rear.}
<B>__{close shot jap pilot}
<A>__{he jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove, throws up his arms helplessly.}
<B>__{long shot open field shooting from roof}
<A>__{the jap plane bursts into flame and crashes.}
<B>__{full shot on roof}
<A>__{the men rise as one with an uproarious cheer. they rush to karelsen, pick him up. warden lets go with another of his rebel yells.}

<C>__{karelsen}
<P>__{(spits over roof)}

<P>__{(pointing after second of the planes)}
<D>__{hey! that last one was one of ours! that was an american plane!}
