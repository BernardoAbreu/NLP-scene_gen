<C>__{jay}
<D>__{when the fuck did this happen?!}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{well, after x men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. miramax optioned bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{miramax? i thought they only made classy flicks like the piano and the crying game?}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{yeah, well once they made she's all that, everything went to hell. so you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? didn't holden mcneil and banky edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie!}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{well boys, i'm no lawyer, but i think holden and banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. i mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and quiet robert.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it ain't me and quiet robert. it's a pair of stupid ass superheroes that run around saying "snitchy nitchies" or something.}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{i believe it "snootchie boochies." regardless you're getting screwed. if i was you guys, i'd confront holden mcneil and ask him for my movie check.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shit yeah. we gotsa get paid.}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{and on that note, we cue the music.}
