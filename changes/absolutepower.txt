ABSOLUTE POWER

<LOC>__{int. washington museum - day}
The saddest eyes you ever saw.
We are looking at an El Greco drawing. It is a study for
one of his paintings.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
brilliantly.
Most of the students are around 20. A couple of suburban
housewives are there too.
And one older man.
This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
successful company executive.
As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
nothing: He has pilot's eyes.
We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --
Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.
Luther. It's not good enough for him. He looks at his
work a moment, shakes his head.
<CHAR>__{girl student} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Don't give up.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I never do.
<CHAR>__{girl student} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 May I?
She's indicated his sketchbook. He nods. She starts
thumbing through.
The sketchbook as the pages turn.
Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good. The
hands are better. Very skillful.
The GIRL hands it back. Impressed.
<CHAR>__{girl student} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You work with your hands, don't
 you?
CLOSEUP - LUTHER
An enigmatic smile. Now, from that --
<LOC>__{ext. red's bar - day}
A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
houses neat and well tended.
Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.
<LOC>__{int. red's bar - day}
Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (as they nod to
 each other)
 Redhead.
<CHAR>__{red} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Luther.
 (as Luther hands
 him a videotape)
 Your life would be a whole lot
 simpler if you could learn to
 operate a V.C.R.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 My only failing.
As he turns --
<LOC>__{ext. neighborhood - luther's house - day}
A street of small row houses. Clean, well tended.
Luther walks toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
carries half a dozen small shopping bags, from the
market, the hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.
<LOC>__{ext. luther's house - day}
A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
door.
<LOC>__{int. luther's house - kitchen - day}
as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
away --
<LOC>__{int. luther's house - dining area - night}
Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
down.
A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.
Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.
Luther studies the photo a moment. Then he turns, looks
out the window.
POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON
is visible. Lovely. Peaceful.
LUTHER
Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
hands and eyes and faces --
-- we are looking at something totally different: a
mansion.
HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.
KEEP HOLDING.
PULL BACK to reveal --
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.
But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
power.
We're in rolling hill country. The mansion is dark.
Totally deserted. Silence.
Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
to a stop. Again, silence...
HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away. There
is a small field between the car and the estate. Now --
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion/int. luther's car - night}
A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --
-- it's Luther, and he's been a professional thief his
entire life. He's a three-time loser, but his last
sentence was so long ago and his skills are now so vast,
so refined, that it is unlikely he will ever get caught
again.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - grounds - night}
The grounds as Luther glides through it. He wears a
backpack.
The night is cool.
He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.
One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
He makes no sound at all.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - front door - night}
Thick wood with reinforced steel.
Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - foyer - night}
The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:
forty, thirty-nine, thirty --
CUT TO:
LUTHER
-- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
than six inches long --
-- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
in the foyer next to the front door.
The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --
CUT TO:
SECURITY DETECTOR
Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --
CUT TO:
SCREWDRIVER
Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
the security panel away.
The BEEPING sound is constant --
-- and getting louder.
A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.
CUT TO:
SECURITY DETECTOR
Eighteen, seventeen --
CUT TO:
LUTHER
probing with the wires into the heart of the security
panel.
The BEEPING is LOUDER still.
The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work
and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe
with the wires and --
CUT TO:
SECURITY DETECTOR
Eleven, ten --
CUT TO:
LUTHER
and he's got it attached!
COMPUTER
Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers
-- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out
clearly.
CUT TO:
SECURITY DETECTOR
Four, three, two --
CUT TO:
FACE OF TINY COMPUTER
as five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 --
The BEEPING sound dies.
CUT TO:
LUTHER
A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security
detector go from red to a warm looking green.
Safe.
He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again,
unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work
quickly, precisely.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - foyer - night}
The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.
It's as if he hadn't been there at all...
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - staircase - night}
Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
looked in the moonlight.
A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
late one, when the madness had him and things were
sliding away. Very sad.
Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --
-- then surprisingly he raises his hand, and for just an
instant traces the lines of the painting in the air, as
if trying to figure out how the magic was done, as if
getting ready for his next museum session --
-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
third floor.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - third-floor landing - night}
Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
overpowering sense of being alone --
-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
moves on.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - hallway - night}
Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.
The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
girl, the next one of the same child at three.
We watch the child grow up in these photos. At ten she
is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.
Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl
you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.
These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy
Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a
shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.
CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH
Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling
happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
here. Now --
PULL BACK to reveal --
A glorious and expensive white wedding dress. Christy
holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.
KEEP PULLING BACK.
And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.
Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.
Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head. Now he
moves on.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - master bedroom - night}
Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
bed.
A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
the other, several more photos of the happy couple --
-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
thick leather handle.
Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.
Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
he's studying the mirror itself.
He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.
Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
the large mirror, clicks once --
-- and the mirror swings silently open.
A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
mirror had been.
Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
held in his hand.
The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.
Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
room --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - vault - night}
It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
we'll get around to.
Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.
He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
table.
Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
slender boxes --
The first box as Luther opens it.
Jewelry.
Into the duffel it goes.
Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel. And
still more. As he continues to do this --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
friendly green.
Now, from somewhere, a distant sound. LAUGHTER? Was it
laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.
Into the duffel they go.
He takes a breath, glances around. Perfect.
Coins. Antique ones. They disappear into the duffel.
Stamp books. Gone into the swelling duffel.
Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER. Not so
perfect.
<LOC>__{int. master bedroom - night}
He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
people. A man and a woman.
Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
-- Luther is alone in the darkness.
A burst of LAUGHTER now. Growing nearer still.
Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...
Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.
HOLD.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside
the open bedroom door.
Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a
WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.
The Woman closes the bedroom door.
Darkness again.
And now the LAUGHING sound increases. GIGGLING, really.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED
but it is there. He is starting to perspire.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
it's over.
Luther blinks, confused, looks around --
-- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.
The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.
Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.
Just a few feet away, just outside the door.
Where things are clearly starting to heat up.
Luther moves to the armchair, sits. There is nothing to
do now but wait. He settles in.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
They are staring at each other.
We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.
This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
black dress. An expensive necklace.
One more thing: she is staggering drunk.
The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.
Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
is.
Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers. He
fills them, gives one to her.
They touch glasses. Down the hatch. Tight laughter.
He looks at her.
She looks at him. There's a lot of sexual tension in the
air.
But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
She spots this.
<CHAR>__{christy} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (drunk)
 It's okay -- I told him I was
 sick -- anyway, he's gone --
 relax...
He nods then, more at ease. And he blows her a kiss.
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him.
Her body moving very slowly.
He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches. Now --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the
room --
What she's looking at: the side table with the remote
that opens the vault.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
The table and the remote waiting there.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, mouth dry...
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him;
he takes her by the hand --
-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed
together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get
fancy, spin her with one arm --
-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose
balance, separate.
They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages
to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in
the drawer of the nightstand --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther. A genuine sigh of relief --
-- which suddenly dies --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with
the necklace in her hand.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into
his tumbler, chugging it down and now...
The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther dead in the water because --
CHRISTY'S
pointing the goddam thing at him --
-- and as she CLICKS it --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught
in the headlights --
-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find
out why.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned
the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the
clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.
Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies
press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her
breasts --
-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to
say, "naughty, naughty" --
-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The
dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She
is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a
smile.
She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have
always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And
Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her
back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples.
Christy moans.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes.
But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more
insistent.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at
Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket,
reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his
shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a
moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her
panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near
the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at
themselves.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces
are just a couple of feet away --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - closeup - christy - night}
as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she
is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes
close and --
CLOSE ON RICHMOND
as his eyes are open --
-- the look on his drunken face is scary.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - christy and richmond}
IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT
looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and
looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at
her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied
bed.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their
first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
like that, her eyes shut tight --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut,
they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
awful look from before is back, only worse, and then
without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --
-- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and
Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond
smiles at her sweetly.
Christy. Shaking her head.
Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly
gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.
Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.
Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
handsome man.
Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant
young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger,
reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.
It's a sweet moment.
They smile.
Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts
and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and
she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,
right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.
Christy sits there stunned.
<CHAR>__{christy} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (slurred)
 You fucking bastard.
And on that --
Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up.
Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as
she is on her feet --
Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, silently applauding.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Richmond, the air momentarily out of him, falling
drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just a moment and
clearly in pain, but he is a big man and he is strong and
he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both are laboring on
the floor and Christy kicks him again and again --
-- but he will not release her ankle. Each kick only
inflames his drunken rage.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (very slurred --)
 You little whore --
And now they both try and stand.
Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it
quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he
is on his feet he begins to strangle her.
Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her
fingers scratching deeply --
-- but he will not let go.
She twists and jerks her body --
-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
throat --
-- and spreads his legs for better balance.
The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches
around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
slashes his right arm.
Now he lets go. And stares, stunned, at his bleeding
arm.
Then he crunches her flush in the mouth, a brutal blow,
and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she
weren't so scared, maybe it would have stopped her, but
it doesn't -- because somehow she manages to maintain
balance --
-- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.
It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless. He
lies on his back, holding his crotch.
But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face,
stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her
hand.
And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --
-- and she drops to her knees beside him --
-- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --
-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --
-- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --
-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
above her head, the point aimed at his heart --
-- and Richmond screams one time --
-- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed
men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway,
GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before
the opener reaches Richmond's heart...
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --
-- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack,
mouth open --
-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
prepared him for this --
-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body
loses strength, he tries to look away, can't --
-- and this is what he sees --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Christy, fighting for another instant of life --
-- no chance --
-- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes
roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the
rug, she collapses like a rag doll --
-- and blood is everywhere.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther. Back in regular motion now. Pale, barely able
to breathe.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
The two well-dressed men in business suits.
BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks
like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating.
But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He
puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.
TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful
shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He
puts his gun away, goes to Christy.
Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but
now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages
to pick up the bloody letter opener.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Kill her?
Collin, by the body, nods.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 No choice in the matter.
His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.
Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
passes out cold.
Burton and Collin look at each other now.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Jesus, Tim, what did we do?
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (echoing Burton)
 No choice in the matter.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but
so is something new: anger. And on that --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door.
Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart.
Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.
Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin. It's
very clear from the outset: these three are not
friendly.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (to Burton and Collin)
 Do you realize what a shitstorm
 we're in?
 (beat)
 Go on -- tell me.
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Nothing to tell. He screamed.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 And you heard no sounds of
 violence 'til then?
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (beat)
 Nothing we haven't heard before.
Richmond, on the bed, out. Russell studies his face as
Burton moves toward the telephone.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Maybe I should call the police
 now.
CLOSEUP - RUSSELL
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (soft)
 Bill? Why don't you think about
 that?
 (beat -- starting to
 move toward him)
 Take a second and just think about
 that.
 (closing in on Burton,
 furious)
 Think... real... fucking... hard.
BURTON
He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (backing away)
 Probably not a good idea.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (taking charge)
 Okay -- here's what happened
 tonight -- poor Christy came home
 alone and interrupted a burglary.
 That sound logical?
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther in the closet. He nods.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Burton and Collin nod, too.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 We're going to have to sanitize

 (shaking Richmond)
 Alan, did you have sex with her?
Richmond, eyes barely open.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 ... Don'... 'member...
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Bill, you're going to have to
 examine her.

<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (she takes nothing
 from nobody)
 I just made you one.
End of discussion.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night (later)}
A clock on the side table beside the three clickers.
There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.
The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as
before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has
been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.
Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.
Everyone wears gloves.
Everything that is incriminating is gone --
-- except the letter opener, which has been put in a
clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump
it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I'll take that.
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (surprised)
 It's got their prints on it.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (she holds out her
 hand)
 Thanks for sharing.
Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell
puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table
when suddenly --
Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying
out --
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Gloria -- I killed her --
Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down --
-- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering
and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall,
uses the bed table to try to steady himself.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, stunned, staring.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from
her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight.
Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him
from the room --
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 It's all going to be fine, Alan.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 ... But she's dead...
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 ... I'll take care of everything
 just like I always do.
 (to Burton and Collin)
 Gentlemen?
She gestures to leave.
Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large
plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and
backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --
Collin stops dead. He stares across at the bed table.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
Luther, holding his breath.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - burton and collin - night}
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Shit.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 What?
In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs
Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm
and leaves.
Burton flicks the light out, closes the door.
The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks
beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.
<LOC>__{ext. mansion - front door - night}
It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond
outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.
Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is
last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he
follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly --
it makes a loud, solid sound.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - luther - night}
The sound is barely audible. He has been looking at his
watch --
The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The
second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top.
Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.
The WATCH face: the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - driveway - night}
Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the
cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell
free to open the back door.
Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it,
moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the
road.
The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries
to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond
comfortably stretched out on the back seat.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he
moves into action.
-- He points the clicker at the door --
-- the door starts to swing open --
-- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the
bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door
starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the
clicker back inside.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - armchair - night}
as the clicker lands -- dead-solid perfect --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand,
carrying his backpack --
-- he slows as he circles the body of Christy Sullivan,
looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO...
The bed table. First, Luther opens the drawer and
pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind
the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener!
In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it.
He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that
has a view of the front of the house. He looks out,
grimaces.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - driveway - night}
The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping
Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the
door. He and Burton move to the front doors.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window
slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around
the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers --
-- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the
window.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan driveway - towncar - night}
Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton
and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond
lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat.
Russell --
-- a moment of relief. She breathes deep. And as
Russell starts to open her purse --
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - knotted rope - night}
as it snakes down the brick mansion -- it reaches the
ground.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Luther, putting his backpack on securely.
The window -- Luther glances out and down.
HIS POV - GROUND OUTSIDE SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
Forty feet below. And it's dark.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of
the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn
backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a
moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and
the backpack wedged against the corner of the window --
-- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan driveway/int. towncar - night}
Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes
true -- the fucking letter opener isn't in her purse and
as she screams again --
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan master bedroom - window - night}
Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the
window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the
rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he
is in serious trouble and...
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - driveway - night}
The Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come
barrelling out.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again,
starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - foyer - night}
Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the
lead.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear
COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --
-- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s
and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten,
so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly
flying.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - driveway - night}
Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house
and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her
life might be over.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan mansion - staircase - night}
Burton and Collin, racing up the second floor staircase
toward the top.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
Luther, halfway down.

The bedroom door, flying open.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the
rest of the way, hits the ground running.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Burton, racing toward the window, Collin goes to the
night table.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - night}
Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Burton, staring out the window and Luther is gone.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Shit!
Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is
gone.
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Shit!
And without another word, they bolt out the door.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - grounds - night}
Luther, crashing through the field. He is in wonderful
shape --
-- for a man his age.
And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan driveway - night}
The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove
compartment, and then he is racing off into the night
after Burton who is a few steps ahead.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan driveway/int. towncar - night}
Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond
is in a half-slumber.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan mansion - grounds - night}
Luther, bursting out of the underbrush --
-- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him --
-- one hundred yards of open field. He runs on.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - burton and collin - night}
as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he
took from the glove compartment.
Thermal goggles.
They put them on, on the fly and...
THERMAL POV
The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF
VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL
IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - open area - luther - night}
Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through
the open field and...
Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but
they are moving faster --
-- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --
-- but Collin can fly.
And he begins to leave Burton behind.
Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that
spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and
his breath coming in gasps and...
Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just
ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --
THERMAL POV
What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of
the open and then disappearing into the woods.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - open area - night}
The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into
overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses
the open area.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - woods - night}
Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM
now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances
back --
-- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it
rocks him, drops him to his knees --
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - open area - night}
Collin and he could be jet propelled.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - woods - night}
Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running
again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging
through the trees now.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - near woods - night}
Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway --
Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too --
Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible --
Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end.
THERMAL POV
The figure up ahead is approaching a car.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - luther's car - night}
Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his
backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - woods - night}
Burton. Pulling up, gasping terribly. He sinks to one
knee.
Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the
least sign of tiring --
-- and now there is a sound: a CAR MOTOR STARTING.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - luther's car - night}
Luther in his car, wheels spinning.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - woods - night}
Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit
anything when you're running like this.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds/int. luther's car - night}
Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - woods - night}
Collin. Slowing.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - luther's car - night}
The car. A swirl of dust.
The dust clears.
The car rounds a corner, is gone.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan grounds - night}
Collin. He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles --
-- and surprisingly, he smiles.
Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady.
He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (still the smile)
 I got his license number.
Now on that --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
Russell -- back in the bedroom, with Burton and Collin
who are moving around constantly, checking the place out.
Things are just amazingly tense.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (close to losing it)
 Gee, guys, maybe it was the

 Asshole --
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 -- take it easy, Miss Russell --
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (trying for calm)
 -- everybody shut up, all right?
He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror. He
crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug.
The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Oh boy...
Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror.
The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan vault - night}
All three going inside, looking around. The chair, the
looted shelves. The truth thuds home.
Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (dead)
 A two-way mirror.
Silently, they move out into the bedroom.
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - night}
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 -- I better get cracking on that
 license number --
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 bunch of money -- I'll tell you
 what he's going to do.
 (beat)
 He's going to run like hell.
And on that --
<LOC>__{int. washington museum - day}
The saddest eyes you ever saw.
It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old
stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are
there too. So are the suburban housewives.
Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --
-- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
the room.
Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
calm and peaceful.
The guard checks the room again.
Edgy, Luther still works away.
The guard leaves.
Luther gets set to do the same.
<LOC>__{int. red's bar - day}
Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee. It's before
the place has opened for the day.
Luther comes in the back. Red slides the videocassette
over, Luther pockets it.

 Jordan beat us at the buzzer.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Bad night.
And as he turns, goes --
<LOC>__{ext. jogging park - parking area - day}
A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above
the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of
runners.
The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a
narrow walk toward the joggers.
She's in her mid-thirties. A good face. And there's
something familiar about her.
<LOC>__{ext. jogging park - day}
Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path,
studying the runners. Now he registers something: and
smiles.
The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along.
She runs well.
Luther. An imperceptible straightening of his clothes.
The jogger. We realize who she is: the little girl in
the photo on Luther's dining room table. All grown up.
Now her face registers something: his presence. Her
eyes go down to the path, she increases her speed.
Luther. Waving, calling out.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Kate.
 (as she runs on)
 Kate.
She slows, hesitates, stops.
Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge
of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind
them. Runners pass by.
Beat.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Probably too late for me to take
 it up.
She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 The jogging.
<CHAR>__{kate } <CHAR_PAR>__{(young woman)}
 Ahh.
Beat.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Dumb way to start this, I guess.
Beat.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Wanted to talk to you.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 About?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Believe it or not, the weather.
 (as she waits)
 Nights are starting to get cold.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 That happens this time of year.
Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I was thinking of maybe
 relocating. Someplace with a
 kinder climate.
 (nothing shows on
 her face)
 I just wanted to check it out with
 you first...
 (still nothing)
 ... you're the only family I've
 got.
And on that --
Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Luther, you don't have me.
The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you
can't tell from his face.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Kate --
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 -- you know what it's like being
 the only kid in show and tell who
 got to talk about visiting day?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 This move -- I'm talking
 permanent, you understand.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 We don't see each other anyway --
 we haven't seen each other since
 Mom died and that's a year.
 (a step toward him)
 Look, you chose your life. You
 had that right. You were never
 around for me. Fine. But I have
 no plans to be around for you.
And now she stops, turns away toward the path --
-- Luther can say nothing, watches her --
-- then she spins back --
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (louder now)

And on those words --
<LOC>__{int. sullivan master bedroom - day}
Christy Sullivan's body.
We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot
of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The
place is covered with black fingerprint powder.
SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief
Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he
had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright,
funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at
him.
He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is
the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies
Christy; sadly shakes his head.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 Wait -- it gets worse --

 all the blood patterns indicate
 that. But she was looking toward

<LOC>__{ext. luther's safe house apt. building - day}
A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than
we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.
An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's
slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears
a battered hat. As he goes inside --
<LOC>__{int. building - foyer/mail area - day}
The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name
"Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of
it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer,
heads toward the elevator.

The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading
toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys --
-- there are three locks on the door... he takes out
keys --
<LOC>__{int. luther's safe house apartment - day}
Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his
hat toward a long sofa --
-- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what
he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished,
modern and clean.
Now he moves quickly --
-- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full
backpack from the robbery --
-- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very
large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the
dial --
<LOC>__{int. luther's safe house apartment - day (later)}

cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has

Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...
<LOC>__{int. morgue - day}
An old man silently weeping.
This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era. A
self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few
enemies.
At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.
We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.
He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
desolate, stares at her once joyous face.
PULL BACK to reveal --

<CHAR>__{walter sullivan } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
 (to Seth, softly)
 I'd been married to my Rebecca for
 forty-seven years and when she
 died, I decided I never wanted
 that pain again. One thing I knew
 about Christy: she was going to
 outlive me.
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I think that's enough for today.
Takes Walter's arm.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (beat)
 I have to ask about the vault.
And on that -- Walter. Holds to Sandy for a moment, then
lets go.
<CHAR>__{walter sullivan} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You mean the contents of the vault
 of course --
 (turns to Sandy)
 -- Sandy, you go on, I'm all
 right.
 (as Sandy looks at
 him a moment)
 Really. Go to the reception --
 obviously I can't make it, but I'm
 sure everyone will understand.
Sandy nods, exits. Seth and Walter are alone.
Beat. Then --
<CHAR>__{walter sullivan} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I know it's not the contents --
 (as Seth embarrassed,
 stands there)
 You mean the chair. You have to
 ask about the chair.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (soft)
 Yessir, I do.
<CHAR>__{walter sullivan} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 But why? Are they connected?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I think someone sat in it -- and I
 think that someone may have been
 involved in the murder.
 (beat)
 You were my father's hero, Mr.
 Sullivan, I promise you this won't
 make my highlight reel.
CLOSEUP - WALTER
Humiliated.
<CHAR>__{walter sullivan} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I'd hoped I could satisfy her...
 but you know... she had needs and
 she didn't want to go behind my
 back... she suggested the chair...
 she hoped I might get to like
 sitting there...
 (beat)
 ... I didn't...
 (takes a breath)
 I've tried for eighty years to
 live a decent life. I've given a
 billion dollars to charity. If
 this comes to trial, none of that
 will be remembered -- I'll just go
 out as the joke of the world.
Seth. He closes his notebook.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I understand, sir; I'll do what I
 can.
<CHAR>__{walter sullivan} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (beat)
 Will you listen to me whine?
 Please forgive me, Mr. Frank.
 Just do your job.

 And I'll do mine.
Walter slowly moves to the door. Seth watches him.
Sadly...
<LOC>__{ext. white house - magic hour}
A gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place. The sun is
setting. It all looks magical.
<LOC>__{int. white house - north portico - night}
A room filled with well-dressed men and women. Formal
attire. The rich and the famous. But the only one we
recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with
several other men. Now, someone says his name.
<CHAR>__{man } <CHAR_PAR>__{(o.s.)}
 Sandy.
 (as Sandy turns)
 Is there anything I can do?
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Mr. President.
And on those words -- The 44th President of the United
States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He
is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is,
also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in
American history, three years into a brilliant first
term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.
His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen
him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of
a dark Towncar.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Take a walk with me.
He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman
moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is
GLORIA RUSSELL.
Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are
their names and they are the best the Secret Service has
to offer.
<LOC>__{int. white house - corridor - night}
The group, as they leave the room, come to a wide
corridor.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Tell me about Walter -- how is he?
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Eighty and alone, Mr. President.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He understands officially my hands
 are tied?
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Mr. President, he's touched at
 your concern.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Any news of the killer?
 (as Sandy indicates
 "no")
 Well, why isn't there? Who's in
 charge of the case?
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Top man -- eight years homicide
 work in New York. But I
 understand how you feel -- it's
 hard to be patient.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (terribly upset)
 No one understands how I feel --
 I'm supposed to have all this
 power but I can't help my oldest
 friend -- you know and I know that
 more than any man alive Walter
 Sullivan put me here -- and now
 when he most needs me, he must
 feel abandoned.
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
On fire --
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 -- I'll hold a press conference --
 and I'll have Walter come -- and I
 will embrace him before the world.
Sandy. Listening. Moved.
<CHAR>__{sandy lord} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He'll treasure that, Mr.
 President. What a generous
 gesture. Thank you. Thank you.
And he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes
Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in
pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks
embarrassed.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (quick smile)
 Damn tennis elbow is killing me.
And on that --
<LOC>__{int. hallway outside oval office - night}
Richmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling
now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton
and Collin hurrying to keep up.
<LOC>__{int. oval office - night}
Burton opens the door for them, closes it once they're
inside.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (throws off his jacket,
 turns on Russell)
 This thing's worse, Gloria. I
 need to see a doctor.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 The country would have to be
 informed, Mr. President.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 What happened to my right to
 privacy?
 (rolls up his sleeve,
 studies his cut)
 I think she nicked a tendon.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Burton says it's a flesh wound --
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (to Burton)
 -- when did you become such an
 expert, Bill? -- Ever been
 wounded? --
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (quietly)
 Yes, sir. Many times.
The fireplace. Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares
at the flames.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Are you serious about that press
 conference, Alan?
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Of course I am -- Walter's been
 like a father to me.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home
 for it?
Richmond, turning from the fire now, quietly.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I think Mrs. Richmond's mission to
 help the poor in Asia should not
 be interrupted.
 (takes a breath,
 starts to button
 his shirt)
 We know anything yet?
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 We checked his license plate -- he
 stole the car from a police
 impoundment lot.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 We're not dealing with a fool
 here.
 (gestures toward his
 jacket, as Russell
 helps him into it)
 Has he initiated contact?
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Burton doesn't think he will.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I agree.
 (checking himself
 in a mirror)
 Sorry about my behavior -- won't
 happen again; think of it as a
 blip on the screen. And as far as
 I'm concerned, so is he.
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He could be a little more than
 that, Alan -- he saw.
Richmond. Big.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He saw nothing -- a drunk woman
 who liked rough sex too much. And
 he's a burglar. Who's going to
 believe him?
 (beat)
 After all, it's not as if he had
 evidence or anything...
And on those words --
<LOC>__{int. luther's safe house apartment - letter opener -}
NIGHT
Luther holds it. It's the middle of the night. Luther
turns the weapon over and over in his big hands...

Burton is alone in his car, exiting the gate and driving
home. He turns onto the main road.
<LOC>__{ext. street near white house/int. burton's car - night}

Burton reaches into his pocket, takes out a MICRO-
CASSETTE RECORDER, flicks it ON.
<CHAR>__{richmond } <CHAR_PAR>__{(v.o.)}

 I think she nicked a tendon.
Burton clicks the cassette off, puts it back into his

<LOC>__{int. kate's apartment - tiny kitchen - day}
A stove with one burner on high. A tea kettle is over
the flame.
It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She
is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and
Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her
apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington
Post.
She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the
kitchen --
INSERT - WASHINGTON POST
Huge headlines -- as big as you can get without a war.
WALTER SULLIVAN'S WIFE MURDERED
BACK TO SCENE
Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then
starts to turn her attention to another section of the
paper --
-- she doesn't get that far.
Kate: she has seen something she didn't catch before --
The front page again. And the headline is still there --
-- but there is a smaller headline beneath it:
 Jewel Thief Sought
Kate sits down hard. Trying for control. Entering a
nightmare. She stares at the paper.
The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter
smiling on his wedding day, of Christy.
But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline:
 Jewel Thief Sought
She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes --
in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate
does not move.
<LOC>__{ext. valerie's middle class neighborhood - day}

Kids riding bicycles. Very Norman Rockwell.
<LOC>__{int. valerie's basement - day}
A bald man. There is the sound of a CLICK. We realize
after a moment that the bald man is Luther.
Another SHOT of Luther looking very different -- full
beard. Again, a CLICK.
Luther again -- elegant beard this time. CLICK.
PULL BACK to reveal --
We are in the basement game room of one of the suburban
homes.
But our attention is on a whole string of Polaroids of
Luther.
Two people are present: Luther and VALERIE. Valerie is
very small, and doesn't miss much.
She has been photographing him, and as the last photo
slides out of the camera, she blows on it, puts it
alongside the others.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (as they study the
 pictures)
 You always did disappear good,
 Luther.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You mean I've got a weak face.
 Thanks, Val.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You're lucky is all -- some of my
 customers, they stand out no

An order form book. Valerie licks a pencil with her
tongue.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 How many passports you need?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (thinks)
 Four should cover it.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (writes this down)
 Now you'll want different looks,
 and matching international
 driver's licenses -- I'll throw in
 some dummy credit cards, seeing
 it's you. How the rugs I made you
 holding up?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 They're good. Beards and
 mustaches, too.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (pleased)
 I try to give value for money.
 Leaving the country permanent?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 It may come to that.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Matter where you've been? -- I
 hate doing those goddam Asian
 passport stamps.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Europe's fine. Maybe the
 Caribbean for winters. When can I
 pick up?
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Usually takes some time, but for
 you, I'll rush it.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Thanks, Val. I've always been
 able to count on you.
Valerie puts the order book down, studies him.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 What?
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I don't want to know what you're
 into, but leaving forever...
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Finish it.
<CHAR>__{valerie} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I never figured you for a runner
 -- thirty percent of my runners
 kill themselves within five years.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (kisses her forehead)
 Five years doesn't sound so bad to
 me just now.
And as he heads out --
<LOC>__{int. police headquarters - criminal lab - day}
Seth and Laura in the good-sized criminal lab. Loaded
with up-to-date equipment.
Seth has drawn a picture of the crime scene. Words like
"Bedroom Door," "Exit Window," "Vault," "Bed," "Victim"
are written neatly to scale. He holds a sheaf of papers.
It's late afternoon and things are already getting
crazed. NOISE in the b.g. throughout.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 See if any of this makes sense.
Seth mimes opening the "bedroom door," stepping inside,
closing it. He makes a click with his tongue.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I am Christy Sullivan and I walk
 in and surprise a burglar.
Seth moves to the "vault door," mimes closing that, makes
a grunt.

 Now you're the burglar coming out
 of the vault and being surprised.

 strangle her when you could just
 shoot?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 That's nothing -- why do I bother
 to have her strip and then put her
 clothes back on?
<CHAR>__{laura} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 There I can help you -- see,
 before you were a burglar you were
 a dry cleaner and you still love
 beautiful clothes.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 And I dress her because?
<CHAR>__{laura} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 She was a good customer and you
 didn't want her embarrassed when
 the police came.
CLOSEUP - SETH
Frustrated.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 She had a point-21 blood alcohol
 level. -- she was too drunk to
 drive. I've checked every cab and
 limo company in the area and not
 one of them knows anything.
 Someone drove her home. Goddamit,
 who? And why haven't they come
 forward?
<CHAR>__{laura} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Maybe whoever drove her home
 killed her.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You saying the burglar drove her

 Part of the job.
Seth and Laura. Seth's lost his train of thought. Then --
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Oh yeah -- remember that bullet
 hole in the wall? Had the lab dig
 out the slug -- guess what -- no
 slug -- why does the burglar take
 the time to do that?
<CHAR>__{laura} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Different from the one in her
 body?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (getting more and
 more upset)
 Oh I like that a lot -- two
 different guns means two different
 burglars. Two guys broke in? And
 they both went out the window?
 Bullshit.
 (big)
 And oh, by the way, why does he --
 or they -- go out the window in
 the first place when he -- or they

 What did you have in mind?
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You know how close he and Sullivan
 are?
 (as Seth nods)
 The minute anything breaks, if
 you'd call me, I'd tell the
 President. That way, he'd be the
 first to alert Mr. Sullivan -- it
 would mean a lot to him. And any
 red tape you want cut -- done.

 Here are my numbers.

 meetings.
Luther and Seth as they sit. Seth smiles, looks at
Luther.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (beat)
 Luther? Why was this so hard?
Luther. Now he's surprised. He kind of smiles.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You want me to help solve your
 case?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Just looking for insight. How
 would you -- scratch that -- how
 would one go about it? What kind
 of person do you think I should be
 looking for?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (like a shot)
 Older fella. Like me.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (now he smiles)
 Because?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Need patience. The secret is just
 research, research, research --
 from everything I've read.
Seth. This hasn't gone at all the way he thought -- and
he's starting to get fascinated.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Research for what?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Well, from what I can tell on the
 tube, it's not a small house.
 (as Seth nods)
 There had to be an architect,
 right? You'd be able to tell
 which one from public records in
 the library. And once you know
 the office, you could break in and
 find the plans and Xerox them, get
 them back before morning.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Not just steal them?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Seth -- breaking in isn't hard --
 what's hard is breaking in so no
 one knows you've been there. Now,
 after the architect, next you'd
 want the contractor's office --
 and the security company's office.
 (beat)
 You know the skill involved
 breaking the security of a
 security company?
 (shakes his head)
 I wonder how those guys do it?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Why go to all that trouble?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Papers said he kept the money in a
 vault, yes?
 (as Seth nods)
 Well, I'm guessing there was
 probably some secret way to open
 it --
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (casually)

<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (fascinated)

<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 remote --
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (shaking his head)
 -- amazing --
 (beat)
 -- must have been a lot of money
 inside.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (sipping casually;
 a pause)
 Five million.
And on those words --
Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course
nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Why's that funny?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 The way you said it -- as if you
 were trying to surprise me.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (smiles)
 I was trying to surprise you.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (smiles back)
 There you go.
Seth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Would the burglar use a disguise?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Seth, you've got to get with the
 program you expect to catch this
 guy -- most likely it is a guy, am
 I right? Some kind of weird
 loner?
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Maybe like you.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (couldn't agree more)
 I'm the perfect prototype.
 (sipping away)
 But you see any face often enough,
 you'll start putting things
 together. That's why these top
 guys disguise themselves. I read
 a great article a couple of years
 back -- damn, I wish I could
 remember where -- anyway, it was
 about these makeup experts some of
 them use -- wigmakers, people like
 that.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (flipping a page)
 Go on about the wigmakers.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (glancing at his watch)
 I'd love that but I'm late as it
 is -- got to get my pacemaker
 checked.
 (he likes Seth)
 -- all this excitement, you
 understand.
<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 A) You don't have a pacemaker, and
 B) I'll be back tomorrow.

A place we've seen briefly before. Dark. Moonlight
through the windows.
The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR.
Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one
largish room, books all over. The home of someone who
doesn't care a whole lot about their home.

Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still
water, sparkling water, carrot sticks.

He closes the door, moves back into the room --

A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a
fingertip, moves on through the silence.
<LOC>__{int. kate's apartment - bedroom - night}
Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around --
-- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law
books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The
mandatory lamp.
And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture.
The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman
with a kind face.
Half a dozen more shots as Kate grew up, the mother grew
older. Mother and daughter, mother and daughter.
Nothing unusual here at all.
So why is Luther so sad?

 That is wrong. That is not

Luther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is
heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed --
-- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning
for Walter Sullivan to join him.
Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself
-- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out
wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward.
Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving
the stool, walking close to the television.
Richmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces
Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace.
<CHAR>__{richmond } <CHAR_PAR>__{(v.o.)}
 Dear friend, old friend, we shall

Sullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod.
<CHAR>__{richmond } <CHAR_PAR>__{(v.o.)}
 Who can explain the ways of
 chance? If we had never met, I
 would not be President. If
 Christine had not taken ill, she

 always been like a father to me.
 I would give the world to lessen
 your pain.
<LOC>__{ext. middleton county courthouse - day}
The press corps. Subdued, saddened.
Richmond and Walter. They turn, face the cameras. The

Seventy very excited people we've never seen before.
They stare around at their surroundings -- they are in
the White House. On a guided tour.
A bright late morning of what's going to be a beautiful
day. A guide leads the people through a doorway. They
troop happily along.
Luther is with them; he seems happy too.
<LOC>__{int. white house - north portico area - day}
The guide leads the people through. They look around,
chat with their friends, follow the guide out.
Luther follows the guide out too.
HOLD ON the room.
All is as it was.
Except a large envelope has been dropped on a side table.
MOVE IN ON the envelope --
-- it's addressed to Gloria Russell.
<LOC>__{int. white house - gloria russell's office - day}
Gloria Russell. Terrified.
Her doors are closed, Russell is at her desk. Burton

Russell. She studies Burton. Then --
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Gee, Bill, that could be construed

 me as an enemy?
Burton stands there, massively powerful. His voice, when
he speaks, is his usual voice: polite, considerate.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Miss Russell, I should have called
 the police that night. But I was
 weak. You convinced me to stay

Russell. Silence.

Kate has risen now -- and in the silence it's clear that
even though they are both standing still, they are both
circling.

 Lieutenant -- I don't know the man

 I went off to live by ourselves.
 We don't make contact. He doesn't
 care about me. I've seen him all

<CHAR>__{seth} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Seth, silently watching Kate. She turns sharply away.
He gestures for her to follow.

 He sure took off in a hurry. What

Luther's bed table --

Call it a montage, call it a collage, call it what you
will, we are looking at dozens of photographs --

Many of them we saw in her apartment -- only here, as in
the photo over the mantle, Luther is there with Kate and
her mom.
We are looking at a shrine!
And there are newer photos too -- Kate at her college
graduation, Kate at her law school graduation, Kate and
her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, Kate
alone on the steps of Middleton County Courthouse --

She looks wonderful and alive in all of them --
Kate. She looks dead now. All energy gone. She sits

 I'd come home and I'd sense he'd
 been in my apartment, checking the
 fridge, shaking his head because
 he never thought I ate right...
 It's crazy but I just knew Daddy

And now she loses it, starts crying silently.
Seth kneels alongside her, gives her a handkerchief.

They are empty and, according to a sign, are due for
demolition. All the windows of the brownstones are
closed -- except one. On an upper story.
<LOC>__{int. brownstone - day}
Inside the window. Michael McCarty, who we last met at
Walter Sullivan's, is there. He looks out.
HIS POV
The glass building and the struggling workmen and, on the
ground floor, a few tables are set outside, with large
umbrellas alongside each.
There is a sign: CAFE ALONZO.
<LOC>__{int. brownstone - day}
McCarty. Beside him is a leather case. He opens it.
The case. A very high-powered rifle. McCarty begins to
expertly assemble it, taut and businesslike.
<LOC>__{int. police headquarters debriefing room - day}
Seth, taut and businesslike, stands by a blown-up map of
the Cafe Alonzo area. The restaurant is circled -- and
around it are marked places for policemen to wait -- Seth
is giving instructions to those policemen now --
-- fifty of them. And no one's smiling.
<LOC>__{int. kate's apartment - day}
Kate. Dressed and ready. Lying on her bed. Afternoon
now. She gets up, makes it halfway to the front door --
-- can't do it -- she turns, goes back to bed, lies down
again, frozen.
<LOC>__{ext. cafe alonzo building - day}
The cursing workmen. The glass panel is so damn
cumbersome they are having a miserable time.
<LOC>__{ext. cafe alonzo - day}
An elderly couple sits at one of the half dozen outdoor
tables.
The place is empty.

Burton, getting out of his car at Seth's Police
Headquarters.
Seth, finishing instructing a dozen motorcycle cops.
Burton moves up behind Seth, waits quietly. As Seth is

McCarty, staring out the window of the brownstone, the
rifle pointed -- very relaxed, he pulls the trigger --
the RIFLE'S not loaded yet -- and the STACCATO "CLICK" is
all we hear.
<LOC>__{int. cafe alonzo building - lobby}
Seth and Burton moving quickly into the lobby of the
glass office building that adjoins the Cafe Alonzo -- the

Seth and Burton. They've both seen a lot -- which
doesn't mean they're not tense. Burton takes out some
Tums, offers them to Seth. Seth shakes his head, brings
out Tums of his own.

Starting down.
<LOC>__{ext. cafe alonzo building - day}
The three workmen and they hate their job. One of them
glances down.
<LOC>__{ext. cafe alonzo - day}
Empty.
Now, from the workmens' angle, a woman moves to one of
the tables. It's Kate. They don't pay much attention.
<LOC>__{ext. cafe alonzo - day}
Kate. She hesitates, then decides on the front table.
She takes a breath. Sits. Motionless.

McCarty as before, with his weapon. He pulls the trigger
again and again, there is the "CLICK" -- now he flicks
away a grain of dust from the barrel --
-- then he puts the weapon down, reaches out and --
ONE BULLET. It's supersonic ammo. McCarty picks it up,
blows on it gently. He might be holding a child.

Burton and Seth. They can see Kate sitting alone in the

Collin. He holds a very high-powered weapon. It looks
like it could kill from a thousand yards away.
Where he is -- and it's not a thousand yards away -- he's
in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than
McCarty.
Collin, loading his weapon. His movements are skilled.
His concentration is total.
<LOC>__{int. brownstone - day}
McCarty, glancing out at the office building area. The
three workmen on the scaffolding are fighting to right
the glass panel. One of them grabs a rope connected to a

Collin. Blows on his weapon slightly.

Kate, and it's a question of how much longer she can take
it. Her trembling is almost out of control -- she
glances around again and --

Luther Whitney himself, and he looks splendid in his new
raincoat and hat --

toward the cafe, walking with his usual grace -- Luther
always seems to glide.

A black police lieutenant, shouting for his men to spread
out.
Burton, turning, turning, trying to make sense of it all.
Three police sergeants on MOTORCYCLES, GUNNING through
the crowd.
Kate, standing now, looking down -- and then she sees it
-- on the ground where Luther was: a new raincoat and a
new hat and --
Seth, and it's all gone wrong and it's all going crazy
and there is noise and there are shouts and there are
whistles.
The black police lieutenant, breaking into a run, chasing

A beautiful necklace. Antique mostly likely. And
tasteful -- we hear the sound of an ORCHESTRA PLAYING
WALTZES.
PULL BACK to reveal Gloria Russell, looking just
splendid, the necklace around her throat, entering a
large and very impressive White House dinner-dance.
Clearly an important affair of state.
We've never seen Russell quite like this -- relaxed,
secure in her femininity. She nods distantly to Burton
and Collin who are, as always, close the President. For

A kick in the teeth --

Luther, slipping inside. Some stairs are just across.

Luther stepping into the main part of the dark house. He
stops. No noise at all except that of someone BREATHING
DEEPLY, coming from an open bedroom door.
Luther passes by -- for an instant we can see that Burton
is asleep, an empty bottle by his head.

lead article reports that a siege has been successfully
broken --
-- Burton, bloody and wounded, is being carried to an
ambulance. A hero. Across the top these words have been
written:
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, YOU GUTLESS FUCK?
Burton stares. Steaming.
<LOC>__{int. collin's house - bathroom - morning}
Collin, yawning, going into his bathroom --
-- across his mirror is taped a large white piece of
paper, across which is written in thick black marker --
"If you could shoot for shit, we'd be out of this."
Collin angrily rips it down.
<LOC>__{ext. downtown newsstand - morning}
A bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers.
The newspapers. Washington, New York, Philadelphia --
and they're all different front pages, of course, but one
photo in all of them is the same --
-- every one of them is running the mug shot of Luther.
And the sense of the stories is the same too:
 HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
 CUT TO:
COMMUTERS
crowded around, making their purchases. Some of them are
young, some of them are half asleep. One of them is in
his 60's and very wide awake --
-- it's Luther --
-- as he buys a paper, looks at the headline --
fascinated.
<LOC>__{int. burton's office}
Still early morning -- Collin is going through Burton's
desk hurriedly --

 What are you doing?
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 Needed a pen.

Russell in the doorway now, glaring at them.

 You're both assholes, now move --
And on that --
<LOC>__{int. oval office - day}
The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the
letter opener.
PULL BACK to reveal --
The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He
studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently
watching him, their hatred of each other clear.
The smell of death's in the room.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (holding the note now,
 his voice is, when he
 speaks, calm; to Burton)
 Any idea who could have forged it?
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 I talked to Seth Frank --
 apparently Whitney learned how in
 prison.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Very gifted man.
The window as he walks to it, looks out.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 And are we close to stopping him?
<CHAR>__{russell} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 We're working round the clock.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Good to know that.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He'll make a mistake.
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Good to know that too.
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND
With more meaning than the words convey --
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 There is one other thing you'll
 want to take care of.
The other three, looking at Richmond.
<CHAR>__{burton} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You're sure you want to do that?
<CHAR>__{richmond} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

 She's a young prosecutor,

Kate Whitney, getting into the elevator. Off to work.
She pushes for the lobby.
The doors close and the elevator starts down.
<LOC>__{int. elevator - day}
Kate checks her purse to see if she has everything.
INSERT - ELEVATOR BUTTON
The "L" is lit --
-- but when the elevator gets there, it does not stop but
goes straight on down to the basement.
<LOC>__{int. elevator - kate - day}
That's strange. She instinctively moves to the rear of
the car.
ODD SOUNDS from the basement. Kate's just the least bit
tense.
<LOC>__{int. elevator in basement - day}
The ODD SOUNDS are LOUDER.
And the doors don't open when they should.
<LOC>__{int. elevator - kate - day}
and now she's starting to get a little scared.
<LOC>__{int. basement - elevator doors - day}
The doors sliding open and the Super standing there with

Kate nods, smiles back, relieved.
<LOC>__{ext. kate's apartment building - day}
Kate, leaving her building, going toward her car, getting
in.
Down the block is a police car. Two surveillance cops
inside. Kate starts to drive -- and so do they.
Kate turns a corner --
-- and so do they --
-- and as they do, they pass Luther, parked on the
corner. Watching. Satisfied, he drives off in another
direction.
<LOC>__{ext. outer city road (washington) - day}
Luther, heading out of the city. The sun is higher in
the sky.

Several cars. Traffic is moving slowly. Luther
continues to drive.
<LOC>__{ext. kate's office building - day}
Kate, coming out of her office building, hurrying along
the sidewalk. Lunch hour.
She goes past some brownstones -- the two cops walk
behind --
-- the window of one of the brownstones is open, shadowy
movement from inside --
-- Kate hurries past, not paying attention... Cops don't
either.
<LOC>__{ext. brownstone - day}
Now a figure begins to appear in the window --
The figure holds something long and thin, like a rifle
barrel --
-- it's a large woman with a long mop -- as she shakes
it --
Afternoon and the sun is strong.
<LOC>__{ext. sullivan master bedroom - day}
Sunlight, streaming in an open bedroom window. Whose
bedroom, though?
Two maids are cleaning it --
-- and now we realize where we are: Walter Sullivan's
bedroom, but it's all been changed, different rug,
different fabrics, different furnishings.
The maids work silently and well. A final sweep of a
dust rag here, a last tug at the bedspread there.
Done. They go to the door, take a last look around.
Perfect.
They go.
HOLD ON the empty room.
Keep HOLDING.
Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps
out, clicker in hand.
The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it
back inside --
-- the door starts to close --
-- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he
took the night of the robbery.
And as he moves silently toward the door.

The elevator stops suddenly on the second floor --

Kate nods, smiles back --

Luther, out of his car now, running like crazy through
the park. Ahead is a sign saying: "JOGGING PATH."
<LOC>__{ext. jogging park - parking area - day}
Not many other cars so she gets a space in front,
overlooking the river, and as she stops, takes out her
keys --
BURTON AND COLLIN
Collin at the wheel, ROARING in behind her, rear-ending
her hard.

<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (terrified)
 ... Kate...?
-- no response -- it's impossible to tell if she's
alive --
-- in the distance now, the sound of an AMBULANCE.
<LOC>__{ext. washington hospital emergency entrance - evening}
The AMBULANCE, SIREN SCREAMING.
PULL BACK to reveal --
Early evening now, getting dark, and the ambulance
braking in front of the emergency room of a large city
hospital --
-- as doctors and attendants with gurneys come pouring
out --
<LOC>__{int. washington hospital - kate's room - night}
A private room. Later. Kate is bandaged and attached to
a bunch of equipment --
-- but however faintly her breathing, it's still
breathing and it's steady. She's alone for the moment in
the semi-darkened room.
<LOC>__{int. hospital corridor - night}
Empty. A doctor comes walking along -- it's Collin.
<LOC>__{int. hospital - kate's room - night}
Kate in her room, sleeping. Another doctor is with her
now, checking her charts.
<LOC>__{int. hospital corridor - night}
Collin. He sees what's going on, stops, pulls out a
small notebook, pretends to read it, all the while
glancing toward Kate's room with the one doctor still
there --
-- now from around the corner, NOISE, COMING CLOSER --
SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROACHING, perhaps more.
Collin turns away from the sound, curses, then stops --
-- The doctor is done with Kate's charts.
From around the corner now, the group coming closer
still.
Kate's doorway as the doctor exits and Collin enters --
they pass each other --
<LOC>__{int. hospital - kate's room - night}
-- Collin moves a step further into the room --
-- and now there is something in his hand --
-- a hypodermic needle.
Kate. Out of it. Lying there, eyes closed.
Collin, the needle ready, moving silently toward the bed.
Kate is barely breathing.
And now suddenly Collin is barely breathing --
-- because the other doctor's arms have viced around
Collin's neck, forcing the air out of him.
Collin, stunned, trying to struggle --
The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet
are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the
bed as the struggle goes on --
-- and Collin's in fabulous shape. He's young and power-
ful and he's been in terrible situations before and he
knows how to fight and he's been taught to defend himself
and --
-- tough shit --
-- the doctor -- it's Luther -- relentlessly increases
the pressure against Collin's throat --
-- Collin can't even gasp now --
-- his feet can't kick anymore --
-- his body starts to go limp --
-- his eyes start to slide up into his head --
-- silence in the room --
-- it's almost over --
-- which is when suddenly Luther lets go.
Collin, eyes flickering open as Luther lays him down on
the floor. All this next is whispered.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Scream. Go on. Which do you want
 most, for me to kill you or life
 in jail forever?
He has gone across the room to the bed. Collin tries to
move, can't.
The hypodermic needle as Luther picks it up carefully,
starts back to Collin.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 Going to guess this wasn't to pep

 didn't...
Luther. Kneeling by Collin now.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 That's because you didn't know
 your crime, prick.

Collin tries to cry out, but Luther covers his mouth.
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (kneeling close, almost
 whispering into Collin's
 ear)
 I didn't mind you tried to shoot
 me at the restaurant -- I wouldn't

Collin. Terrified.
<CHAR>__{collin} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Luther, bending over him. Luther pushes the plunger.

Collin dying now. His breathing is getting strange, his
body starting to stiffen. And on that --

Kate, eyes barely open. From her position Luther is
simply kneeling, nothing else is visible...

Kate. She closes her eyes.

Georgetown mansion. Later in the evening. The car
starts to move. Walter looks frail and very old now.
And somehow smaller.

 nothing)
 They were drunk -- at first he

 You fucking well do, don't shake

-- Seth indicates Kate.
Luther crosses his fingers.
Seth says something we can't make out.
Luther nods.
Seth glances a final time at Kate, then leaves them.
Luther moves to Kate, studies her face.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (eyes still closed)
 ... was that Seth...?
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 He was just checking in. When
 you're up to it, he said we might
 come over for dinner. He
 mentioned --
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (eyes half open)
 I know, he lives alone --
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (smiles)
 Watch it now.
He arranges her sheets.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 ... you don't have to fuss...
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 You were forever catching colds.
She nods, drifts and we --
 CUT TO:
MOON
starting to fall out of the sky now.
LUTHER
stands by the window, looking out. Soon, dawn. He
stretches, crosses to her.
<CHAR>__{kate} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 ... am I going to be all
 right?....
<CHAR>__{luther} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
 (long pause)
 We'll be fine.
Kate nods, drifts.
Luther watches her.
Then he goes to his chair --
-- reaches down --
-- pulls out his sketchbook.
He turns the pages.
Drawings of Kate.
He turns to a new page. Starts drawing her again. He's
really getting good.
HOLD ON Luther and Kate.
 FINAL FADE OUT:
