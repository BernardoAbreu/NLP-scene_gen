<L>__{exterior jud and louis}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{last name's crandall, little missy.}
<A>__{louis looks at him sharply as ellie rejoins them.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{that's where i buried my dog spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14. dug it good and deep. by the time i finished, i had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. soil's stony up here.}
<A>__{ellie looks awed. louis looks a little awed, too. jud sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is still looking at ellen.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{do you know what this place is, ellie? oh, i know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. do you know what a graveyard really is?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{well...i guess not.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{it's a place where the dead speak, missy.}
<A>__{he sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. he ruffles her hair reassuringly.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{no not right out loud. their stones speak...or their markers. even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a magic marker, it speaks. ain't that so, louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i think it is so, ellie.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what if you can't read what's written on there anymore?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{yes }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{to remember.}
<C>__{jud }
<D>__{yes. to remember. this ain't a scary place, ellie. it's a place of rest and speaking. can you remember that?}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{they start to walk slowly back toward the arch.}
