<A>__{hana walks between the cabins. stuart steps out of the shade. he is drawn, older than last seen.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{my leave is canceled. i can't meet you later.}
<A>__{hana frowns, helpless. as if to emphasize this, a staff nurse comes by, carrying a bowl and a withering look.}
<L>__{58. interior beach cabin. day.}
<A>__{hana enters, approaches the patient. she's circumspect.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{excuse me }

<C>__{hana}
<D>__{can i ask my friend, can he come in? just for a few minutes?}
<C>__{the patient}

<C>__{hana}
<D>__{he's going back to the front this evening. i can't see him otherwise.}
<C>__{the patient}
<D>__{just go off. i will be quite all right.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{no, i can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us every other cabin is crammed. this is as private as we'll get.}
<C>__{the patient}
<D>__{well then yes. of course.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{thank you. thank you.}
<A>__{she hurries out, returns with stuart. they stand awkwardly.}

<C>__{the patient}
<D>__{i'm going to sing. if i sing i shan't hear anything.}
<A>__{and with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of yes! we have no bananas. he changes language each verse. the couple stand, formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.}
<C>__{hana}
<P>__{(touching his lip)}
<D>__{you've got a mustache.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{a bit of one.}
<C>__{hana}

<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i had a hotel room.}
<C>__{hana}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i thought that was for when we were very very old?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i'm feeling old.}
<A>__{they embrace, fiercely, hardly making a sound, or moving. the patient}
<B>__{roars the song.}
