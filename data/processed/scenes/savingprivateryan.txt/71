<L>__{exterior bridge night}
<A>__{dark. quiet. the distant guns are silent for once. waiting. reiben, upham, jackson, ryan and miller have tightened their perimeter. miller is in a trance. the others glance at him nervously. they eat in silence. k rations. some bread. a last supper. then, from out of nowhere, miller speaks:}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{english teacher, addley, pennsylvania.}
<A>__{slowly, miller's men turn to him.}
<C>__{upham}

<D>__{i teach english at addley high school in addley, pennsylvania.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, i will be goddamned, i knew it.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{like hell, you did.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{captain, what about our deal?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i changed my mind.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{what deal?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i coach the baseball team, too.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{no kiddin'?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{what deal?}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{they all sit in silence.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you know that cruise ship wade's grandfather was on?}
<A>__{they all nod, except ryan who doesn't know what miller's talking about.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i wonder if his cabin is still available?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{that's not where i am. miller no? where are you?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm in a dressing room with mrs. rachel troubowitz, our super's wife. she's an easy forty four, double e, but i've convinced her she's a thirty eight d and i'm watching her try and squeeze herself into a side stay, silk ribboned, three panel girdle with s helf lift brassiere.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{she's having a devil of a time, getting into that thing.}
<A>__{they all share reiben's dream for a moment. then jackson smiles.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{me? i'm walking with my hound, lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon. i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey...}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{jackson, how many times i got to tell you, you're from tennessee.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i am, but i like imported whiskey. so there i am and i hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. that ole' boy comes right out of the brush, i got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. i aim, i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here. then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.}
<A>__{upham smiles.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i don't know, i kind of like wade's idea about the cruise ship. i've never been to tahiti.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{what about you, captain?}
<A>__{miller smiles. he knows exactly where he is.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{say what, cap'n?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you see, i've got the best house in all of addley. it's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. the garage windows face left field. the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them. the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens. two hundred twenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows. it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship. i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass, i know we're one step closer to winning it all.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{don't that get kind of expensive, cap'n?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it's worth it.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{to each, his own.}
<A>__{they're all silent for a moment. then miller turns to ryan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how about you, james?}
<A>__{ryan sighs.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm home, playing basketball with my brothers, it's evenin' time, we're trying' to get in a few more points before it's too dark to see the ball. that's where i am.}
<A>__{they all nod. miller tears off a piece of bread and passes it to ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on. they all eat in silence.}
