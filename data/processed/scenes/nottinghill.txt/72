<A>__{william is with rosie by the door just about to say goodbye.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{maybe we'll meet again some time.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. that would be... great.}
<A>__{she kisses him gently on the cheek. he opens the door she walks out. he shuts the door quietly and heads back into the living room...}
<L>__{interior max and bella's living room night}
<A>__{max and bella wait excitedly.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{she's perfect, perfect.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{and?}
<A>__{william makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i think you have forgotten...}
<P>__{(he looks at them)}
<D>__{what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love, who'll love you the chances are... always miniscule. look at me not counting the american i've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's not fair.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{still loves you though.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{in a depressingly asexual way.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i never fancied you much actually...}
<A>__{they all roar with laughter.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i mean i loved you you were terribly funny. but all that kissing my ears...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh no this is just getting worse. i am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{do you want to stay?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{why not all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman.}
<A>__{music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.}
