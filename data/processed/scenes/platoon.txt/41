<L>__{interior the barracks night}
<A>__{in comparison to the darkness of the hooch, a highly lit atmosphere, attracting bugs ... dusty gear lying around a disordered hooch, loud and finger snapping country western music playing from a tape deck, a well known tune, circa 1967. bunny, the 18 year old angel face, totters drunk with a colt 45 beer in hand, over to junior, the badass black kid with the zits, who just lies there on his cot sweating, doing nothing.}
<C>__{bunny}
<P>__{(listening to the music)}

<D>__{only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you and then maybe.}
<A>__{lt. wolfe wanders down the aisle, beer in hand, slightly lonely, bypassing fu sheng, the hawaiin and tony, a mustached hairy browed italian kid from boston, who are playing some kind of dice game. they hardly acknowledge the lieutenant who stops by rodriguez, the mexican american kid who is on his cot in his neatly arranged area writing a letter home with a pencil, forming his words with his mouth, as always minding his own business. religious objects comprise his few decorations.}
<C>__{lieutenant wolfe}
<P>__{(amiable)}
<D>__{how you doing rodriguez?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{good sir.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{need anything?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{no sir.}
<A>__{wolfe winks at him, continues on to the poker game going on in the center of the barracks, the main action. barnes, sgts.o'neill and warren, the quiet sullen black, sanderson and sal play as ace, the tiny radio kid, and morehouse look on; all of them drinking beer and bourbon chasers from a bottle.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<P>__{(to o'neill)}
<D>__{how's it going red?}
<P>__{(using his nickname)}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{shit, cocksucker's got all the cards tonight.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<P>__{(to barnes)}
<D>__{looks like you're doing all right sergeant.}
<A>__{barnes, raking in the chips, is the big winner, a light bead of sweat on his forehead and a somewhat glassy look to the eye the only indication he is drunk his shirt peeled off revealing a muscular, scarred body.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{yeah, and i ain't even cheating yet.}
<C>__{sanderson}
<P>__{(the big blond kid)}
<D>__{have some kentucky windage lieutenant.}
<P>__{(passes him the bottle of bourbon)}
<A>__{wolfe takes a nip.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{play lieutenant?}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{nah, i wouldn't want to get raped by you guys ...}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{what are you saving up to be lieutenant jewish?}
<A>__{laughes. wolfe forces a smile, glad to move on. there is a continual worried rodent air about him, an anxiety, a desire to fill the vacuum in his leadership with a false masculinity.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{catch you men later. enjoy yourselves.}
<A>__{as he goes, o'neill shakes his head after him.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{sorry ass motherfucker ain't he. you think he gonna make it barnes?}
<A>__{barnes plays a card, glances, a minute movement of his head.}
<C>__{o'neill }
<D>__{yeah that's what i figger. some dudes you jes' look in their faces and you know they just ain't gonna make it.}
<A>__{barnes looks with some irony at o'neill. the country western tune has reached a crescendo whine which now mixes into:}
