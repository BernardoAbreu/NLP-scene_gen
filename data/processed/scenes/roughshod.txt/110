<T>__{dissolve out:}
<L>__{exterior hilltop dusk dissolve in:}
<A>__{long shot. clay, in close foreground, stands, leaning on his rifle. the sun has set and the valley below is in shadow. there is the silence of dusk. no wind stirs the trees. there is some light outlining the high mountains treeless crags and domes and spires. clay turns.}
<B>__{reverse shot}
<A>__{down the hill in the forest, is the wagon. beyond it the horses stand. steve is stretched out on his stomach studying his magazine. helen is sitting on a tarp playing solitaire. clay starts down the hill toward the camp. med. shot up angle clay walks through the trees. as he comes around a big yellow pine, he stops suddenly and looks down.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{angled down past clay. mary lies on the carpet of pine needles, her head pillowed on her arms, her dress pulled taut across her chest. she is looking up through the trees at the fading sky.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{clay stares down at mary. she does not look at him. she is aware of his presence, but she doesn't show it. in the soft light of dusk she is very lovely. clay is conscious of her lovliness. he would like to drop down beside her.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{mary. she turns her face to look at him. camera angle widens. clay stands above her, looking down. for a moment their eyes meet. clay starts away. camera holds on mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{where you goin'? over to the other side of the street?}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled past mary, who rises slowly. clay looks back, hesitates, then crosses to where the horses are tethered and starts saddling his mare. mary moves down toward him through the trees.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{clay tightens the cinch. mary moves up to stand beside him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{are we leaving?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's too light yet.}
<A>__{he swings into the saddle, pulls the rifle out of the scabbard and lays it across the pommel.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{better go on back and get some more sleep. you'll need it later on.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{you're not going out to look for them?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no, i'm not. all i want 'em to do is keep ahead of us a long way ahead. so i'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.}
<A>__{he touches the mare with his spurs and trots down the hill. he disappears around a bend in the trail.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{mary, in the f.g., is staring after clay. helen is watching her. steve has risen and walks up behind her. he smiles at her.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. don't worry about him.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{oh, i wasn't worrying.}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.}
<A>__{she starts down toward the wagon, steve walking beside her and camera trucking with them through the forest.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you were worryin'.}
<A>__{mary glances over.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. you can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and you've got me all figured out?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they have passed helen, playing solitaire on the canvas, and have reached the place where the grub box stands. steve spreads a tarp for her.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will fix us somethin' to eat.}
<A>__{mary sits down. steve opens the grub box and takes out some plates, tinned food and hardtack.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{like when you were standin' there looking after clay. i knew right off what you were thinking. because i've been watching you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you were supposed to be reading words.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i was doin' both. here.}
<A>__{he hands her a plate of food, takes another and goes over to helen.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{helen looks up from her card game, takes the plate with a smile.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thanks, steve.}
<A>__{he grins at her, turns and comes back to mary who is watching him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{better not let clay catch you waitin' on us.}
<A>__{steve sits on the edge of the grub box and picks up his plate.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{don't pay any attention to him. that's his way and i've found he's sure easy to get along with. i don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and i guess i had it comin'.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but you're his brother.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he'll treat his wife just as good. maybe better. ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?}
<A>__{mary shakes her head.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yes sir, clay's nice to be around.}
<P>__{(the clincher)}
<D>__{he don't chew much and when he does he spits outside.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{you make him sound wonderful... go on. tell mary more about him.}
<A>__{steve looks over at her, embarrassed, a little hurt by her tone. he rises, takes mary's empty plate and his own and goes over to the little spring to wash them. mary looks sharply at helen. helen shrugs. mary rises and follows steve over to the spring.}
<B>__{med. close on spring}
<A>__{steve kneels by the little pool, washing the plates in the run off. mary stops above him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she was only teasin'.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(offhand)}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{let me do that.}
<A>__{she kneels beside him. steve looks over at her.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i like to do things for you. didn't you know?}
<A>__{she looks down at the water bubbling up into the little moss lined pool.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i know now.}
