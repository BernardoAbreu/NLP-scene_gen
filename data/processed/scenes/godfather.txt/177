<A>__{high angle on don tommassino's villa we hear girlish laughter; the little alpha is driving erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost hitting th inner court wall. appolonia is laughing, driving. michael pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive. outside the walls, we notice shepherds with luparas, walking guard duty. the car stops and a laughing michael gets out.}
