<L>__{exterior paris day}
<A>__{crane down from a view of paris on a misty day. cool, gray and beautiful. a taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. all around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business. the door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in christian louboutin high heels swing out.}
<L>__{interior gare de l'est, paris day}
<A>__{we follow the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station. men turn and stare. cara mason (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. she wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the international herald tribune in the other.}
<L>__{interior brasserie, gare de l'est day}
<A>__{a young waiter wiping down the bar stops to watch cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart. an older waiter approaches her. they exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{she's waiting for someone.}
<C>__{younger waiter}
<D>__{probably waiting for me.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{the door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work.}
<A>__{a messenger clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around. he consults a photograph. his eyes land on cara. he walks over and holds out a document sized envelope.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{c'est vous, mademoiselle?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{oui.}
<A>__{as the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. there is a ticket for the orient express and a handwritten letter... she spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads...}
<C>__{alexander's voice }
<P>__{(english accent)}
<D>__{they are following you cara.}
<A>__{she looks up. takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her...}
<D>__{alexander's voice (v.o.) (cont'd) they think you'll lead them to me. but if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away...}
<A>__{cara scans the rest of the letter. camera glides down to see the signature at the bottom: "love, alexander." we barely have time to read this before cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it. the young waiter hurries over, alarmed.}
<C>__{younger waiter}
<D>__{mademoiselle! je vous en prie }
<A>__{cara is already gathering her things and walking away.}
<L>__{interior gare de l'est station moments later}

<D>__{take the 4:25 orient express to venice. en route select a man my approximate height and weight...}
<A>__{her eyes scan the platform.}
<D>__{alexander's voice (v.o.) (cont'd) have faith cara. i will be with you soon.}
<A>__{cara's pov men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "the orient express." she pauses only long enough to assess and discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight... her gaze comes to rest on a well dressed french man. medium height, medium build. standing alone. examining his ticket. cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train. adjusts her hair and dress. satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the well dressed french man like a cat stalking prey. the camera admiringly follows her silky approach. the french man hears the click of her heels and looks up. his mouth falls open... his wife arrives and shuts it for him.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{what are you doing vincent? our train car is over here!}
<A>__{with a regretful backward glance at cara, he allows himself to be dragged away. frustrated, cara turns and casts about for another possibility. she spots a tousle haired man seated on a bench.}
<C>__{conducter }
<D>__{all aboard! all aboard the 4:25 is departing!}
<A>__{tousle hair gathers his bags to get on the train. encouraged, cara moves to cut him off. as tousle hair stands up reveal... he's six foot seven. cara stops short, irritated. the man behind her boarding the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't notice. bam he walks straight into her.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sorry! excuse me. pardone moi.}
<A>__{frank taylor (30's, amiable) is a cheerful american tourist. open face, completely lacking in guile. frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around cara and boards the train. cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. frank is a man of average size, average build... she peers over her glasses at him. and her expression slowly changes. she follows him onto the train.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{a good looking englishman loitering further down the platform, reading the herald tribune. or rather, not reading it. he's been watching cara. he lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.}

<A>__{the gleaming orient express pulls out of the station and gets underway.}
<L>__{interior orient express afternoon}
<A>__{the train is moving. the thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels, the subtlety of the lalique mirrors and the softly lit lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury. frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. he's wrapped up in a dog eared paperback spy novel. so wrapped up that he barely notices cara sit down opposite him. she crosses her legs. he glances up. slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off. then the headscarf tied around her neck. follow her sensual movements in tight close up. the effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip tease. frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled. she takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes. she goes to remove her mock turtleneck sweater. the zipper seems to give her trouble. without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and leans toward frank.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i think i'm going to need your help.}
<A>__{frank is barely able to respond.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{my zipper...}
<P>__{(off his blank look)}
<D>__{it's stuck.}
<A>__{frank finally moves into action. he sets his book down and leans closer. awkwardly he reaches towards cara's beautiful neck. he attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. but the zipper resists.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm afraid of hurting you.}
<A>__{she slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{don't be afraid.}
<A>__{the train car sways slightly and throws frank off balance. he tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives with a tearing sound. frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm... sorry.}
<A>__{cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe i should let you do this }
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{don't give up so quickly.}
<A>__{reluctantly, frank continues with the zipper. the tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch. first her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered. the zipper keeps going downward. no sign of anything underneath. frank is practically sweating. finally he uncovers fabric. he finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat. cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{and settles back into her seat, cat like. he stares at her for several moments, at a loss for words.}

<D>__{i'm a mysterious woman on a train. you tell me what my story is.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay... you'd be a diplomatic attache or... let's see... a girl from east germany whose father's been kidnapped by soviet agents. they're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. there's usually a microchip involved.}

<P>__{(severely)}
<D>__{what started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious. after a year in the training program at goldman sachs, he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living. that, in turn, involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling: money laundering.}

<A>__{she stares into his eyes for a beat. finally looking at her without a trace of deception. she believes. they hear voices on the stairs below. frank holds up a finger to her wait. frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built in bookshelf. it swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor. frank removes the fitted floor boards. there is a sophisticated bio metric lock just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie. frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open.}

<A>__{ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back. for the briefest of moments, frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect. frank gives him a little smile. cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat. close on ackerman: his eyes narrow. he knows. for a moment he doesn't move. then, in spite of himself, a small smile creeps over his face too.}
