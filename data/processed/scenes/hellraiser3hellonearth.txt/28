<L>__{interior carduccis antiques day}
<A>__{joey and terri enter the store. the store is different, its selection of merchandise reduced. the 50's and 60's junk hardware is still there, along with some of the more mundane victoriana, but it seems more "normal" none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there. also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old, interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd. there seems to be no one in attendance.}
<B>__{angle on girls}
<A>__{ as they walk through the store.}
<C>__{mama}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{can i help?}
<A>__{the voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the counter as mama carducci moves into view from beneath it. mama, an ancient and slightly eccentric italian american woman eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a customer in decades. not aggressive, just surprised.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yes. thank you. we were wondering ... terri, show her the box.}
<A>__{terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{no. sorry. not interested. not for my customers. have you tried ...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no. no, you don't understand. we're not selling it. it came from here. we want ...}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{everything sold as is. no guarantees. no returns.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no. we want ...}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{i took back everything bought on a whim, i'd have no business. i ...}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break.}
<A>__{a sudden silence. both mama and joey stare at terri in surprise. mama looks back at joey.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{quite a mouth. so what's the problem? you tell me. you i like.}
<A>__{joey smiles. terri raises her eyes to heaven. mama waits.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{thank you. this came off a ... statue? a pillar. we wondered if you knew anything about the piece. about where it came from.}
<A>__{mama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{oh ... yeah. yeah. that thing. ugly. real ugly. i sold that?}
<A>__{mama's eyes scan the store.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{never mind. i'm glad it's gone. made the store feel strange. who'd make such a thing?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{fine. fine. but can you tell us anything about it?}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{it was part of a job lot. some loony bin they shut down. unclaimed stuff.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what else came with it? anything still here?}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{sure. just papers, photos. stuff nobody'd ever want.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{can we see?}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{you gonna buy?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{right at the back there. middle shelves. coupla folders. nice stuff. i'd do you a good price.}
