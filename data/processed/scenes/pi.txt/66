<D>__{three, seven, two...}
<A>__{he smashes the old computer apart. he tosses his step stool through the mainframe. then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard covering the glass panes. nothing doing, so he yanks the entire window wide open. sunlight floods the room and throws max into the}
<B>__{blinding white void}
<A>__{where max looks around starry eyed. the pain is gone. everything is new to max even his hands. the stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag. max continues to recite the number his voice becomes tender and peaceful. as he starts to become part of the void, his voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close. then he hears devi.}
