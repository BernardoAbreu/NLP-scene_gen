<A>__{the convoy is entering rougher country. the narrow mountain road we've seen earlier ascends ahead. to the side of the road are tall boulders. suddenly, indy shoots out from between two rocks and rides directly for the truck. the armed nazis in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas hides their view. but gobler, belzig and the gunner in the rear staff car have a brief line on him. belzig points and the gunner fires away and indy, the bullets kicking up sand near indy's horse. the armed guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see what's happening. indy has been riding alongside. now he stands on the horse and leaps to the cab. in a second, he has flipped the armed guard out of the truck. he slides into the cab and begins grappling with the truck driver. the truck driver tries to hit the brakes, but indy kicks his foot away and floors the gas pedal. the truck doubles its speed and shoots onto the steep mountain road.}
