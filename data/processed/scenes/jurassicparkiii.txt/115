<A>__{grant and the kirbys are still inside.}
<L>__{exterior the river underwater night}
<A>__{the cage sinks. the closest to the door, paul manages to get out. the other three aren't as lucky. the cage rotates as it descends and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping them inside. in the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars. debris and equipment float around them. paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. spinosaurus pushes past the boat. if anyone is going to save his family, it has to be him. and so he dives. pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy structure, just enough so amanda, eric and grant can get out. paul himself isn't so lucky. spinosaurus grabs the cage and paul, throwing both straight up out of the water. paul flies twenty feet away, further from the shore.}

<A>__{spinosaurus is going after the heroic mr. kirby, who dives, swimming underwater. he's trying to lead it away from his family.}

<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{up! up!}
<A>__{he points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages off the large boats. now well accustomed to fleeing on command, amanda sends eric up first, climbing the scaffolding like a jungle gym. all the while, they're trying to spot paul. grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as spinosaurus returns from the water, slamming into the base of the crane. the whole assembly shudders, threatening to rip into the water.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{where's dad?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{just hold on.}
<A>__{try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. so instead it rams it, shakes it, trying to knock them off. eric slips, but amanda catches him. about to shed his bag to climb higher, grant finds one last hope. it's the resonation chamber model. a beat before he decides: it may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice. he blows through it, the same eerie pitch we heard before. on the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard the raptors give. he keeps it up, repeating over and over. spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused how this sound could be coming from a non raptor. but then keeps smashing. we can hear the mounting bolts strain. soon the whole crane will tip. but not before a matching cry is heard in the jungle. grant stops, not certain he heard it. but there it is again. he keeps blowing. the crane is close to tipping when a single raptor appears from the darkness, chirp barking at the spinosaur, who simply bats away. but then more raptors come. and even more. soon there are dozens gathering, circling. grant stops signaling. all three survivors watch with horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter which side wins. looking at his adversaries, spinosaurus roars. and suddenly the raptors attack. spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they just keep coming. they climb up his back, slicing, into him with their razor sharp claws.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{jump! swim for the far shore!}
<A>__{all three drop from the crane arm into the water. meanwhile, the fight continues. spinosaurus rallies, shaking off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. their hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone. spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally collapses, dead. the raptors continue to shred it to ribbons. then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors swimming away. but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. it goes back to its meal.}
