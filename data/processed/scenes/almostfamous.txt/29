<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{dressing room activity swirls around him, as william simply listens. he holds a small microphone. his stoic look gives away little of the full body rush he's experiencing. as the other band members drift across frame, russell hammond, a true rock and roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready for the show. to the kid, every word is reckless gem.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{... and it's okay, because rock and roll is a lifestyle... and a way of thinking and it's not about money and "popularity!"}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{some money would be nice.}
<A>__{jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into his scalp poor man's mousse.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{ but it's a voice that says here i am... and fuck you if you can't understand me.}
<A>__{russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth from his guitar case. the kid notices all these close up details of rock.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{and one of those people is gonna save the world and that means that rock and roll can save the world all of us together.}
<A>__{the kid's eyes dance. he checks to make sure he's getting the recording. he listens intently.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{and the chicks are great.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but we didn't do it for that! we are here because we needed to fuckin be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from troy, michigan, which we did... but what it all comes down to is that thing. the indefinable thing, when people catch something from your music, the thing you put into it. i'm talking about... what am i talking about?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(elegantly)}
<D>__{the buzz?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{the buzz! and the chicks, the whatever, is an off shoot of the buzz. and like you saying you liked "fever dog?" that is the fucking buzz, man. all we get are these fucking old ass interviewers who don't understand, don't listen, don't appreciate why we are here, which is the fuckin' buzz.}
<A>__{william nods, holds his microphone steady. russell tunes his guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks. jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{the next album will be even better. more texture.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but... it's not what you put in, is it? it's what you leave out. listen to... listen to marvin gaye...}
<A>__{russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of music.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{a song like "what's going on." that single "woo" at the end of the second verse you know that woo that single "woo."}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{i know that, "woo."}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(he does it)}
<D>__{that's what you remember. the silly things, the little things... there's only one, and it makes the song. it's what you leave out. that's rock and roll.}
<A>__{william nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed. activity surrounds him.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{we used to talk more about this stuff.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{okay. see, this is maybe the most honest we've ever been in an interview because you know our music.}
<A>__{you're}
<D>__{the first press guy we've made friends with. we don't normally talk like this to them. and you're supposed to be the enemy! what are you 18?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{there you go. still young enough to be honest.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(walkie talkie crackling)}
<D>__{ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who isn't in the band out!}
<A>__{russell takes a last swig of beer. a roadie whisks his guitar away.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{all this luggage is going to l.a.!}
<A>__{william is swept out in the chaos of the pre show ritual, past the pile of luggage by the door. it's a colorful heap of suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a number.}
