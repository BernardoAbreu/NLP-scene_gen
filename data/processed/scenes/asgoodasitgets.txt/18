<L>__{interior restaurant day}
<A>__{carol and leslie, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar. leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. carol is rapt. as they pass melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice. though she is aware of him resentfully so hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{clippity clop clippity clop she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "thank you." no, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.}
