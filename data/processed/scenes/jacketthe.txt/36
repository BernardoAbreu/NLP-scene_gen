<L>__{interior ward, alpine grove, next morning}
<A>__{starks sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other, more vocally insane patients. he runs his hand uncertainly over the scars on his arm from the jacket and looks around not knowing where his paranoia ends and reality begins. the old man from the previous day is moving slowly with the aid of his walker. he is far less threatening to starks today...just a senile man about to walk into a wall.}
<D>__{starks [getting up to help him] let's get you a destination other than this wall.}
<A>__{rudy mackenzie 40s, smart eyes, fidgety, with an innocent face watches starks help turn the old man around.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{that's kingsley. old bastard hears us, i'm sure. he just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. i know. i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. literally. [beat] you're the cop killer, right?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, guess so. how'd you know?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{tv. helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [sticking out a jittery hand] rudy mackenzie.}
<C>__{mackenzie }
<D>__{welcome to the village, william starks.}
<A>__{starks doesn't offer his hand, just looks back at mackenzie.}
<D>__{starks [looking away] i'm not really in the mood to talk.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{that's too bad. i don't believe in disposable language either you know, the small talk, the little talk. chit. chat. useless. the game's something else though. think about it: what can we trade with each other in the air between us? this... [running his hand through the air] is our court. [beat, so eager it's sad] i'm ready to throw the ball. come on.}
<A>__{starks looks at mackenzie and sees that the constant flow of words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his eyes. a dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight.}
<D>__{starks [relenting] what are you in here for?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i tried to kill my wife.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{don't you go to jail for that?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i tried something like 30 times.}
<A>__{there is, as starks rightly figures, no suitable response to that.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{she's bigger than me, and she's stronger than me. and i never planned on doing it. it was always in the heat of the moment. i didn't beat her or anything. hell, she beat me. but when we'd start fighting, i'd go for the knife. then she kept threatening to have me put away, and [looking around] she finally did.}
<A>__{as he talks, mackenzie notes the scars on starks' arms. dr. lorenson observes starks and mackenzie talking and starts walking towards them.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{or just plain stupid. you'd think by the twentieth time, i'd have found an alternative method. maybe a more effective one, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{morning, gentlemen. how are you doing today?}
<A>__{mackenzie winks discreetly at starks before he replies.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{it's a hard one for me, dr. lorenson. [finally turns to face her, grimly] the world around me, it's shrinking. there's not even room for light to make its way in. [beat] da da bum! da da bum! i feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me, doc. only today, he's not carrying flowers.}
<A>__{lorenson reprimands mackenzie by turning to starks.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{what? it's better than fine.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{and you, mr. starks? starks [already on the defense] i'm fine.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{mr. mackenzie, do you think i could talk to mr. starks privately?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{of course you can, doc. william, it was an absolute pleasure. thanks for playing.}
<A>__{just before he walks away, mackenzie turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks starks right in the eye.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{hey...when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. [beat] they don't eat you when there's music playing.}
<A>__{starks looks at mackenzie briskly, wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut. but mackenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away dead arm in tow.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{so you're ok? starks [still distracted] what?}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{i asked you if you're ok. starks [suspiciously] i don't know. you tell me, doc. you think there's anything wrong with me?}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{i don't know. you're not my patient.}
<A>__{starks looks away. lorenson gives him a once over.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{you look like you've lost some weight. are you eating?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i am. one of the few things i remember doing is eating. so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams.}
<A>__{starks looks at lorenson, seeing if he'll respond. lorenson looks back curiously at starks' pointed stare.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you done with your small talk?}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{starks walks away slowly and weakly a fact that doesn't escape lorenson's observation.}
