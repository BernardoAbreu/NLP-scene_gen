<L>__{interior examination room}
<A>__{chase spins around at the commotion as tiger darts across the floor with the barking dog in pursuit. mayhem ensues as zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile. geoff rushes in from the boarding area. tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney. zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from tiger's tiny, striking paw. drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on zowie's collar. he pulls the dog back. geoff rescues tiger from beneath the gurney. drew shrugs sheepishly.}

<A>__{with one eye on zowie, chase sprays some antiseptic on the examination table and wipes it clean.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{let's have him hop up here.}
<A>__{drew prods zowie. zowie jumps up onto the table. chase looks over the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the dog's eyes. gus passes a lingering look over tiger. he reaches in to pet her, making sure it meets with geoff's approval.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{when i was young i thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.}
