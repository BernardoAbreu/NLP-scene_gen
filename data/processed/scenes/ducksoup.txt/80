<A>__{door, as it is being opened by two pages. trentino and vera enter. they both stop and bow in acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene. as they walk toward table and out of scene, chico and harpo enter. the latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up under his arm. he flips the carpet runner away from him on the floor, holding onto one end. it rolls out and harpo strides majestically down its length toward the table with chico following. harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into it, and continues on, following chico, who is now ahead of him. harpo breaks into a run and he and chico dash madly to the table. they take seats on either side of groucho and without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them. the guests are standing. trentino and vera arrive at their places and everyone sits down. harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig saw puzzle. he mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together again ... groucho watches him... then helps him...}

<D>__{that was awfully good, i think i will have a second helping... waiter...}
<A>__{snapping his finger to waiter off scene. the waiter immediately appears placing a second dish in front of groucho. he starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when chico turns the table toward himself... this brings his food to chico... harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again when the table stops turning... this time groucho has nothing in front of him...}
