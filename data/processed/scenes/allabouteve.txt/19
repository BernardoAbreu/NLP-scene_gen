<L>__{interior margo's bedroom day}
<A>__{margo is propped up in bed, still reflective. birdie comes in with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from margo. she starts on some petty chores. margo takes a sip of orange juice...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{birdie }
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you don't like eve, do you?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{do you want an argument or an answer?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{an answer.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{now you want an argument.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she works hard.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{night an' day.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she's loyal and efficient }
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{like an agent with one client.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she thinks only for me...}
<P>__{(no answer from birdie)}
<D>__{... doesn't she?}
<C>__{birdie}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how do you mean that?}
<A>__{birdie stops whatever it is she's doing.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i will tell you how. like let's see like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. how you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(breaks in; sharply)}
<D>__{i'm sure that's very flattering, birdie, and i'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!}
<A>__{there is a sharp, brisk knock. eve comes in. she's dressed in a smart suit. she carries a leather portfolio.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{good morning!}
<A>__{margo says "good morning," birdie says nothing. eve shows off the suit, proudly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well what do you think of my elegant new suit?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{very becoming. it looks better on you than it did on me.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{i can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there are you sure you won't want it yourself?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{quite sure. i find it just a bit too too "seventeenish" for me...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... i'm on my way. is there anything more you've thought of ?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{there's the script to go back to the guild }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've got it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{ and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{right here.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it seems i can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(smile)}
<D>__{that's my job.}
<P>__{(she turns to go)}
<D>__{see you at tea time...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{eve...}
<P>__{(eve turns at the door)}
<D>__{... by any chance, did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time?}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{oh, golly. and i forgot to tell you }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes, dear. you forgot all about it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, i was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards and i guess i was asleep when you got home...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes, i guess you were. it it was very thoughtful of you, eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{mr. sampson's birthday. i certainly wouldn't forget that. you'd never forgive me.}
<P>__{(she smiles shyly)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i sent him a telegram myself...}
<A>__{and she's gone. margo stares at the closed door. then at birdie. birdie, without comment, goes out. margo, alone, looks down at her orange juice. absently, she twirls it in its bed of shaved ice...}
