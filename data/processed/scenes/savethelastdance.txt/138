<A>__{pince nez leads sara to the stage. announces her. sara walks onstage. she nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience. her eyes anxiously search for patrick... hoping. her music begins. grieg's peer gynt (morning). sara starts to sway, moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. her line, proportion and balance are impeccable. tchaikovsky's swan lake (tanz der schwane) begins and sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music like a flower. she completes every turn and twist and leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. she is doing what a dancer should do engaging the audience, igniting their imagination, drawing them in. angle judges perking up, taking notes, attentive to her.}
<B>__{sara}
<A>__{finishes with a flawless arabesque. looks out. reverse angle judges one of the more imperious appearing judges removes his glasses, speaks to her. sara's still trying to catch her breath.}
<C>__{stern judge}
<D>__{you prepared a free form?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{yes... sir... they have... my music.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{does it have a theme?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{yes. emo...}
<P>__{(clears her throat)}
<D>__{emotion.}
<A>__{the judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see:}
<C>__{stern judge}
<D>__{cue johnson's music.}
<A>__{music up: a remix of hip hop (e.g., lauryn's hill's doo wop; nas's "we will survive" and jay z's latest) and snatches of classical.}
<B>__{sara}
<A>__{stands there. doesn't move. can't. she finally walks up to the edge of the stage. looks down at the judges, her eyes filled with trepidation. her voice is a shaky whisper.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i wasn't ready. can you start it over again?}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{the judge waving off the music. it stops. he regards sara impatiently.}
<C>__{stern judge}
<D>__{are you ready now?}
<A>__{before she can respond, patrick's voice booms from the back of the auditorium.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{yes, sir. she's ready.}
<A>__{angle widens to reveal him coming forward. rushing for the stage. he pauses at the apron of it. looks up at sara. she peers down at him, astounded. shaken. he smiles at her. she smiles back. patrick's eyes softly take her in.}

<D>__{you can do it.}

<A>__{sara's eyes focus on him. she nods. turns to the judges.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<A>__{as her music cues up, patrick slowly backs away from the stage. sara begins to dance. she starts out strong and gets stronger. every emotion she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a way that we've never seen before, not even when she was practicing with patrick. her body has finally found a way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its meaning and transform her dance. the music ends. the lights go up. sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless, sweating. she lifts her head slowly and the angle widens to reveal patrick letting out a giant whoop... the judges react and the audience gasps... ... as he bounds onto the stage and... roy jumps to his feet. proudly and loudly clapping. just like glynn. angle sara overwhelmed beyond belief. patrick's coming toward her. she flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. but the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer, which is her love for patrick.}

<A>__{sara pulls patrick back. walks alone to the edge of the stage, composed and professional again. she regards the judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy, then simply says:}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{thank you. very much.}

<A>__{sara's face lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek to cheek smile. wider as she walks slowly, deliberately back to patrick. stops. looks at him. just looks. and then she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging him. emotional. patrick swings her into the air, twirls her around and around, as we:}
