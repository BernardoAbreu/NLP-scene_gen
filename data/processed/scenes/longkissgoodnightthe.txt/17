<L>__{interior samantha's hospital room two days later}
<A>__{samantha, having survived. laid up now in an austere hospital room. listening to silence. stares out the window at a sunlit tree. head bandaged. frowns:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i want a cigarette, why do i want a cigarette...?}
<A>__{outside, snow slithers... her eyelids, slowly closing. slides off the edge of consciousness... in the dream: she stands on a windswept cliff, before an incongruous full length mirror. staring at her reflection it's bleeding from a scalp wound. she probes her head... frowns. nothing. nothing but the tiny ridged scar she's had for as long as she can remember.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{what... what do you want...?}
<A>__{the reflection eyes her grimly. haggard. tired.}
<C>__{reflection}
<D>__{i want a cigarette.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i don't smoke.}
<C>__{reflection}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{you used to.}
<A>__{samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. she raises it to her lips. her reflection mirrors her precisely. except samantha coughs, chokes on the smoke while her bloody reflection takes a long, satisfying drag.}
<C>__{reflection}
<D>__{relax, you can drop the act. nice and smooth, take another hit. there you go. see how easy it comes back?}
<A>__{they are now in perfect synchronicity. sam inhales easily.}
<C>__{reflection}
<D>__{i'm coming back. you know that, don't you? name's charly, by the way. you're gonna love me.}
<A>__{the reflection grins. there's blood on its teeth.}
