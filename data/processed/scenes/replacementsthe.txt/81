<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior field late afternoon}
<A>__{we're on the clock which shows one minute ten seconds left in the fourth quarter.}
<B>__{on huddle}
<A>__{it breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage. shane drops into the shotgun.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hut, hut!}
<A>__{shane rolls left but there's a blitz! the cornerback is almost on him when shane shifts and rolls the other way.}
<B>__{on franklin}
<A>__{he's wide open five yards from the goal line.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{they're breathing down his back. shane's pov he sees franklin and cocks his arm. suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere. shane dumps the ball. he's immediately decked by a defensive end.}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{we watch the flight of it in slow motion. we follow it right into the hands of... a new england patriot defensive back.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's down and not moving. on todd, rod and bob they scream in despair.}
<B>__{on annabelle}
<A>__{she falls to her knees in pain.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{falco is intercepted. that's too bad.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{yeah, and it looks like he's hurt, too. he was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter. only forty eight seconds now left on the clock.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's helped off the field and onto the bench. on mcginty he grabs bateman before he can run out onto the field.}
<D>__{mcginty danny.}
<P>__{(very slowly)}
<D>__{get me the ball.}
<C>__{bateman}
<D>__{the ball. okay, coach.}
<A>__{he runs out onto the field.}
<B>__{on patriots}
<A>__{they line up.}
<C>__{patriot qb}
<D>__{hut, hut, hut!}
<A>__{the quarterback hands off to the running back right up the middle in a typical "run out the clock" play. bam! bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the runner and literally rips the ball out of his hands as he goes down.}
<B>__{on crowd}
<A>__{they go wild!}
<B>__{on annabelle}
<A>__{she does a cartwheel. on mcginty he's leaning over a groggy shane on the bench.}
<D>__{mcginty don't shake your head at me. you are going back in there. you are gonna run the same god damn play, you are gonna throw the ball to franklin again and this time, he's gonna score.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i can't...}
<A>__{mcginty grabs some smelling salts from a hovering trainer. he shoves them under shane's nose. shane is suddenly very awake.}
<D>__{mcginty you are the only one in this entire stadium who can do it. do you understand me? you can do something no one else can do. so, start right here. start living your destiny. or give it up for good. right here. right now.}
<A>__{shane stares at him. then he stands up, wobbles and puts on his helmet.}
<B>__{on huddle}
<A>__{they're all turned and watching as shane makes his way slowly out onto the field. annabelle watches him closely.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{here comes falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{i'm surprised to see him again after that shot he took from bellinski.}
<B>__{on huddle}
<A>__{it breaks and shane stands over evans and looks out at the defense. nasty looking linebackers and cornerbacks stare at him.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{22 green!}
<A>__{his voice cracks and several defensive players openly laugh at him. shane gets an idea.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{check! black 43! black 43!}
<B>__{on andre}
<A>__{he's down in a three point stance facing a defender. he whispers to reese:}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(whispering back)}
<D>__{he's changing the play. listen!}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{black 43!}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{it's a long count. falco could be calling an audible.}
<B>__{on lamont}
<A>__{he shifts position in the backfield.}
<C>__{lamont}
<P>__{(to shane)}
<D>__{is this right?}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{black 43 left!}
<A>__{lamont shifts again. clifford goes in motion from his flanker position but then changes his mind and goes back the other way. lamont and clifford then bump into each other.}
<B>__{on patriot defense}
<A>__{they are totally confused now as they try to adjust to the equally confused redskins. on mcginty he looks extremely pissed.}
<B>__{on shane}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hut! hut!}
<A>__{he turns to hand the ball off to lamont but lamont is not there. shane turns the other way and sees lamont just standing there looking at him. shane runs over to him and hands him the ball. meanwhile, the patriot defense is going the other direction. lamont takes off. one cornerback is not taken in. the guy dives for lamont's legs. we hear a clank as the cornerback's helmet hits lamont's industrial knee brace. the guy bounces off and lamont trots into the end zone.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{lamont scores!}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{whoa! falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and lamont takes it in!}
<A>__{shane, meanwhile, is looking at mcginty on the sidelines.}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o.) (in shane's helmet)}
<D>__{i guess you saw something i didn't.}
<A>__{shane nods vigorously.}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o.)}
<D>__{don't try to bullshit me, pal. you didn't want it. winners always want the ball with the game on the line. you know that.}
<A>__{shane looks down.}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o.)}
<D>__{alright. the play is... waggle right, drag hook. you understand?}
<A>__{shane nods. on o'neil he looks ten years younger as he and augustine watch.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{with eight seconds remaining, pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{this turned out to be one hell of a contest, pat!}
<B>__{on pacifico}
<A>__{he sets up for the kick.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he waits for the snap.}
<B>__{on brian murray}
<A>__{he sets up at his flanker position.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hut!}
<A>__{shane catches the snap and pitches the ball out to murray from his holding position.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{it's a fake!}
<A>__{the patriot right defensive end breaks through and reaches for murray. the only person in his way is shane, still kneeling in the holding position. shane screams as the huge lineman trips over him and then falls on him. murray sweeps around the right side and scores untouched. redskins win. everybody goes nuts. on o'neil he pounds on augustine. on todd, rod and bob they pound on each other. hail to the redskins is deafening. on mcginty he just smiles.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's still under the defensive end. reese evans pulls the guy off and bends down to shane.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{we won, shane. we won!}
<A>__{shane manages a painful smile.}
