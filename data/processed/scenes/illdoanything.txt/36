<L>__{interior theater lobby night}
<A>__{burke, prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and studio execs and popcorn development staff wait. he looks off to see matt and nan chatting in another part of the lobby.}
<B>__{on matt and nan}
<A>__{as they arrive... nan looks off to see the group captain approach.}

<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(suddenly and loudly)}
<D>__{oh, please. it's one thing being a son of a bitch, but you don't have to be a stupid son of a bitch. people move heaven and earth to see their kids. i don't care if she moved to pluto, it's abandonment.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(a pause, then)}
<D>__{hey, we just met.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh. sorry.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{make a guess how we did.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{it wouldn't mean anything.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{nothing good that happens can make it worth feeling the way i do now. nothing.}
<A>__{an older woman approaches them.}
<C>__{older woman}

<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{everyone, all the studio and popcorn staff, is drawn to nan.}
<B>__{on nan}
<A>__{as she glances at the figures. on nan's left hand as she secretly reaches for and holds burke's hand. is it in sympathy or congratulations?}
<B>__{tight on studio executive faces}
<A>__{as we see in ever so slowed actions, tense lips turning gloriously upward to reveal gums then a smile. more smiles as we pan across teeth... bonded executives and bonded teeth. the shot widens. the studio head mumbles to himself as he carefully goes over the tally in every category. then:}
<C>__{studio head}
<D>__{i don't need the numbers. i loved it.}
<A>__{his smiling face takes us:}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{burke, ninety in the top two boxes.}
<B>__{to burke}
<A>__{a tear in his eye a smile shyer than others. he turns to the old lady, instinctively using this victory to settle his most recent score as he says mockingly:}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{now can i get you some water?}
