<A>__{the impala blasts along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. it slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth.}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{why the hell we stoppin'?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you said you had a cousin near here.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{so give him a call. see if we can shack there til' things cool down.}
<A>__{jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth. in the b.g. we see jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory. phillip steals a glance at butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{why'd he take the keys?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{so i won't leave him.}
<C>__{phillip}
<P>__{(a tad hopeful)}
<D>__{would you leave him?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<A>__{in the b.g. jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. he tosses the keys to butch, who starts the car and drives off.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{musta' moved. prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway. goddam ear's still bleedin'. you ever try that shit again...}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you were in the middle of threatenin' me.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(from the movies)}
<D>__{ain't a threat. it's a fact.}
<A>__{butch reaches over, takes phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{here kid, take the wheel.}
<A>__{phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. butch turns back over the seat to confront jerry.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{in two seconds i'm gonna' break your nose. that's a threat...}
<A>__{before jerry has time to snicker butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun. blood spurts from jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened phillip.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{... and that's a fact.}
<A>__{instead of expressing outrage, jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm gonna' kill you for that.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{and that's a threat. beginnin' to understand the difference?}
<A>__{somethin' catches butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into...}
