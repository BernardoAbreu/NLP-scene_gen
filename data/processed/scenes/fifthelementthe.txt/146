<L>__{interior korben's stateroom}
<A>__{korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{listen, ma! i've only got a few days vacation and i will be damned if i'm gonna spend them on the phone.}
<A>__{the door rings.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{...hang on, it's the door. no! i told you i didn't bring anybody! i'm all alone... as usual!}
<A>__{korben opens the door. it's not the champagne. even better. it's leeloo.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(to his mother)}
<D>__{...i will call you back.}
<A>__{leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress. korben has to turn away once more.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{here we go again...}
<C>__{leeloo}
<P>__{(by rote)}
<D>__{you know women normally change five times more than men.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you get that off the screen?}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you noticed..}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{ok, you can turn around!}
<A>__{korben turns around. leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy to the max. he is smitten. so much so that leeloo wonders if something isn't quite right.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{i'm going to see the diva sing. what's the matter?... do i look bad?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{no, not at all! i mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!}
<A>__{leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her. she turns, revealing her unzippered back. korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh. her perfect bottom.}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{do you know how this works?}
<A>__{korben's blood boils. she wriggles, pressing her hands together close to the zipper.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i have an idea.}
<A>__{but instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist. a flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going from the floor to the ceiling. stunned, leeloo is held captive.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i told you i need to work in peace. remember? i need to concentrate.}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{and you can't concentrate with me around?.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{it's difficult.}
<A>__{she tries to breakout.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{army issue. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. impossible. korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on. leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.}
<C>__{leeloo}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{you're nothing but a... a...}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. i won't be long.}
<A>__{the door flies open. loc rhod barges in.}
<C>__{loc rhod}
<D>__{hey stud we gotta...}
<A>__{then he sees the scene, leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress. his mind goes to the obvious.}
<C>__{loc rhod}
<D>__{korben my man what's happening here? who's the chick? what's the gig? we free forming here? getting funky with the monkey? can i get in on this?}
<A>__{korben grabs him by the collar..}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{no..to all of the above.}
<A>__{and yanks loc rhod out of the room. leaving leeloo looking extremely unhappy.}
