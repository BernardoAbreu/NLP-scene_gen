<L>__{exterior new york street day}
<A>__{the mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward the subway. a patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his eye. sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. hordes of people crowd the sidewalk. the crush of humanity is frightening. two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at him. before sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their arms cutting through his ghostly form. sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people approach him from all angles. we hear a baby carriage roll through sam's feet and he nearly falls over trying to avoid it. his instincts will not let go. a barrage of images and sounds assaults sam. it is more than he can handle. still, he refuses to give up. he stays close to the mugger.}
