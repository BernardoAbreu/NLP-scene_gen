<L>__{exterior london street day flashback}
<A>__{the sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown uniforms and jack boots fill the streets.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{and after that there were no more roses...}
<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{rossiter presses his elbow onto evey's neck, holding her submerged.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{not for anybody.}
<A>__{rossiter lets evey up. her red burnt lungs gulp at the air.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{after the takeover, they started rounding up the gays. they took ruth while she was out looking for food.}
<A>__{evey blinks hard, black fireworks exploding in her eyes.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{why are they so frightened of us?}
<A>__{she wheezes, on the edge of unconsciousness.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{they burned her face with cigarettes and made her give them my name. she signed a statement saying i'd seduced her.}
<A>__{the interrogator's voice melts into a slag heap of sound with the hot, rhythmic pounding in her ears.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{i didn't blame her. god, i loved her but i didn't blame her.}
<A>__{rossiter uncuffs evey, slipping the black bag over her head.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{but she did.}
<A>__{evey's knees buckle as he forces her to stand.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{she killed herself in her cell. she couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch. oh, ruth.}
<A>__{evey weaves down the hall. rossiter shoving her from behind.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{they came for me. they shaved off my hair. they held my head down a toilet and told lesbian jokes. they brought me here and pumped me full of chemicals.}
<A>__{the cell door swings open.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{i can't feel my tongue. i can't speak.}
<A>__{rossiter yanks the hood from her head and pushes her in.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{it is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place but for three years i had roses and apologized to nobody.}
<A>__{the iron door slams shut, lock ringing in the stale air.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{i shall die here. every inch of me shall perish...}
<A>__{evey rolls to her knees.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{except one.}
<A>__{she crawls for the rat hole.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{an inch. it is small and fragile and it's the only thing in the world that's worth having.}
<A>__{her shaking hand pulls the letter from the stone crevice.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{we must never lose it or sell it or give it away. we must never let them take it from us.}
<A>__{evey clutches it like a rosary as she begins to cry.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{i don't know who you are but i hope you escape this place. i hope that the world turns and things get better and that one day people have roses again.}
<A>__{she holds the note to her face, her tears soaking into the fragile paper.}
<C>__{valerie }
<D>__{i don't know who you are but i love you. i love you. valerie.}
<A>__{slowly, evey slips away, succumbing to blackness.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i had come to know every inch of those four walls in that dark hell and they knew every inch of me. every inch...}
