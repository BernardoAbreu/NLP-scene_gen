<L>__{interior corridor beatrix's house night}
<A>__{strange, unearthly music... a flickering light in a dark tunnel. fernando, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor. quietly opening a door, he walks into columbus' study.}
<L>__{interior columbus' study night}
<A>__{close on: a huge illustrated map of western europe and asia. fernando's candle moves slowly across the atlantic ocean, to the edge of the map. there, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters: terrifying demons; creatures half human, half animal. sitting at his desk, columbus is looking at the map.}
<C>__{fernando }
<D>__{you can't go there!}
<A>__{turning, columbus finds his son beside him.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{fernando points at the monsters. he pulls the boy to him.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{there aren't any monsters, fernando. the only monsters are in here...}
<P>__{(he taps his own forehead)}
<D>__{watch!}
<A>__{he takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once. fernando laughs immediately.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{i want to go with you!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{there'll be a time.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{you promise?}
<P>__{(columbus nods his head)}
<D>__{do you swear on st. christopher...?}
<A>__{fernando pulls the chain with the st. christopher medal from under columbus' shirt.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven?}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{yes... yes, i do... on all of them!}
<A>__{and he hugs his son tightly.}
