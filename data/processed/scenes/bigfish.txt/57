<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{in a single shot, karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.}
<L>__{exterior main street of ashton day}
<A>__{spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of ashton are gathered to see off edward and karl. there's a few tears amid the familiar faces.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(loudly, for the crowd)}
<D>__{edward bloom, first son of ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go. but take with you this key to the city, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.}
<A>__{edward ducks a bit so the mayor can put the key around his neck. the crowd cheers. and with that, edward and karl start walking, waving as they go. only don price, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see edward go. he crushes his cigarette under his heel. he wishes he could crush edward. many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug edward or shake his hand.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{that afternoon as i left ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.}
<C>__{various townfolk}
<D>__{find yourself a nice girl! don't trust anyone in kentucky! watch your pride, edward bloom!}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{but there was one person whose counsel i held above all others.}
<A>__{as the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with}
<B>__{the old woman.}
<A>__{the ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast. she motions for edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him. although we're very close, we can't hear her voice.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{she said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.}
<A>__{the advice only succeeds in confusing edward.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(to the old woman)}
<D>__{okay. thanks.}
<A>__{edward and karl keep walking. the old woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{beats me.}
