<A>__{the original customers have now been joined by the four bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and pungent moonshine type liquor from a shared jar. eli enters. all eyes are on him immediately, regarding him with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar. the bartender approaches, looks him up and down. suspicious.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{outlander? let me see }
<A>__{eli raises his hand as before. holds it outstretched, steady.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what'll it be?}
<A>__{eli places the canteen on the bar.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{water.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{that's the good stuff. gotta eat into my own ration to sell it so i don't sell it cheap.}
<A>__{eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. the bartender takes it and looks it over. not particularly impressed.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{that'll get you maybe half way.}
<A>__{the bartender spies eli's silver saint christopher pendant.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what about that?}
<A>__{eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. no way that's for sale. instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's the best i got.}
<A>__{the bartender takes a pelt and examines it. the mangy cat leaps up onto the bar and approaches. sniffs at the pelts with suspicion and hisses at eli. eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. at the biker's table hog watches this, not happy about this. satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{solara!}
<A>__{a teenage girl emerges from the back. no older than 16 or 17. dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. but even through all this, it's clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman. the bartender takes eli's canteen and hands it to solara along with a ration card he keeps around his neck.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{take this out back and get it filled.}
<A>__{solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look eli up and down. unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued. there's something about him she can't put her finger on... he doesn't look back at her. she turns and exits.}
