<L>__{int nite: luna azura toilet (winter 1945)}
<A>__{michael steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard. he actually uses the urinal. then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. then he moves to the booth, up to the old fashioned toilet. slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun. we see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun...he gropes searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun. close on michael; the feel of it reassures him. then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband. for some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them. then he goes out.}
