<A>__{at the precise moment, indiana releases the dead arm. he lands on a rocky ledge. located only a few feet below the open crypt floor. indy stands on the ledge. safe. he smiles. relieved. suddenly, the ledge snaps! indiana falls! his body drops hundreds of feet into the blackness. a moment passes. then... we hear a splash! bottom of the hole! a pool of water! surrounded by rocky, cavernous walls. indiana's hat floats on the water's surface. indy pops out of the water, bobbing up beside the hat. indy reaches for the hat. suddenly, a fish flaps out of the water. the fish gobbles up one of the hat's live baits and disappears back underwater. indy smirks.}

<A>__{indy attempts to pull himself out of the water. there is a loud sound. grinding metal. rattling chains. indy's eyes dart to his side. two horizontal metal gates eject from the cavern walls! they shoot across the water! like lightning! they're headed toward each other... and indy's head! indy dives underwater. the gates snap shut! less than an inch above the water's surface! indy attempts to resurface. the closed gate stops him. he clutches the grating, trying to move the gate. it's too strong! indy struggles for air. no good. there isn't enough space. he's going to drown!}

<A>__{in desperation, indy swims downward. looking for an alternate escape. but there is no bottom in sight. indy's eyes bulge. his face loses color. only a few precious seconds of life remain...when suddenly, he spots something. a small tunnel. built into the cavern wall. indiana hurriedly swims to the tunnel. he bolts inside. a water fountain. a large, three tiered stone structure. instead of the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain is surrounded with water spewing demons, gargoyles and hellish beasts. camera dollies to a large metal drain, located inside of the fountain's base. the drain cover begins to turn. suddenly flipping open! indiana crawls out of the opening. he gulps at the air. color returns to his face. life returns to his body. indy rises to his feet. he finds himself standing in the fountain. indy's pov he is inside of a banquet room. the sprawling room is beautifully decorated in victorian dignity. the room is immaculate. not one speck of dust. two medieval suits of armor adorn one wall. a gargantuan crystal chandelier hangs above a long, mahogany banquet table. at the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired elderly man. it is baron seamus seagrove iii, the fellow whose likeness appeared in every piece of artwork. baron seagrove is calmly eating his dinner. a bloated roasted pig rests on a silver platter before him. the same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the family crypt, now rests on the table. directly beside the baron. two powerful, muscular mastiffs are tied to baron seagrove's chair. teeth bared. eyes aelaze. the hounds fight for a scrap of meat. indiana stares in bewilderment at the new surroundings. he steps out of the fountain. baron seagrove seems unaware of indy's presense. indiana walks toward the baron.}
