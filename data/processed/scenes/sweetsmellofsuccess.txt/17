<L>__{exterior twenty one club night}
<A>__{camera high, shooting west down 52nd street, as sidney's cab pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 club. sidney maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the entrance and the camera descends to shoot along the courtyard towards the entrance. we see the figure of jimmy weldon and his girl friend coming out of the club. closer angle night jimmy weldon is coming out of the club accompanied by a girl; he is slightly tight. as he steps through the outer doors, weldon again spies sidney on the sidewalk; he steps to one side of the entrance way. sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to enter the club, weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard. sidney is instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of weldon.}
