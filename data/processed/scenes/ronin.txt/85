<L>__{exterior a back road later early evening}
<A>__{the town of orange is just visible below us as the commandeered car drives up into the hills. vincent is behind the wheel, while the wounded sam sits in the passenger seat. gritting his teeth, sam peels back his shirt to get a look at the wound, and it's small but bad the ricochet ripped a small raw hole in sam's side. the wound bleeds, but moderately so no major organs or arteries have been hit.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that makes twice now you've saved my life.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i didn't save your life back there. risked it, maybe but i didn't save shit.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you see it your way, i will see it mine. you need a doctor.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{you know one around here? somebody you trust?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no...i thought i'd take you to the hospital.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no hospitals. i will fix this myself if i have to.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(he can't believe this)}
<D>__{fix it yourself?}
<P>__{(a thought comes to him)}
<D>__{why are we even doing this? there's no need to run, christ...}
<P>__{(he can't disguise his disgust)}
<D>__{you're a cop.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you're with interpol you're a cop.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{if i was a cop, a real cop, i'd have busted you a long time ago. this isn't about you, it's about the job i have to do.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{and what job is that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my job, vincent, a job you don't need to know about. i can't go to the local cops they'd never be able to get close enough at this pointerior it's me or nobody, and i've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.}
<A>__{beat. sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one to vincent and takes another for himself. they smoke for a second, before vincent speaks.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we? there is no we in my world now, vincent, just me.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm going with you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this doesn't involve you, don't you understand? i can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it isn't about money for me, not anymore.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't have to do this.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(with great finality)}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<A>__{sam gives vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never seen before, and sam can only smoke in silence and consider this as we }
