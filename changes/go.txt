<ACTION>__{A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night, DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat. Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine. The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids. Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding. Bleeding a lot. She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to         a favorite joke.}
