<L>__{interior white house oval office night}
<A>__{the president sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair mussed. standing before him are grover honeycutt, the director of the f.b.i., and clifford baldwin, c.i.a. chief. kaufman stands to one side. all are red eyed, tired, and frustrated.}
<C>__{honeycutt}
<D>__{i never gave such a directive, mr. president.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{nor i, sir it would be out of the question.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{gentlemen, i didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, i just want to explore the possibilities. now, i have three questions; is the man a foreign agent? or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? now, i'd like some answers.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. we can rule that out.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{very well... can we rule out inefficiency...?}
<A>__{there is silence in the room. a couple of looks, but silence.}
<C>__{president }
<D>__{i see. what about question three? is it possible to erase all traces of a man?}
<C>__{honeycutt}
<D>__{highly unlikely, sir... in fact, the boys around the bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off would be an ex f.b.i. man.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<P>__{(a look to honeycutt)}
<D>__{i don't think that's entirely true, grover.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(to baldwin)}
<D>__{and what do the boys around intelligence think?}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{well, mr. president... they don't quite know what to think.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations.}
<P>__{(goes to door)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{the president leaves the oval office.}
