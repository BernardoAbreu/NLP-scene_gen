<A>__{diane’s feet lose her footing in the mud and she falls into the shallow end of the unfinished swimming pool, sliding all the way down the wet mud to the puddle in the deep end. the pool lights come on. backlighting the rain and diane’s flopping actions as she regains her balance is the quagmire. then, a gushing bubble explodes next to her in the mud. she stares at it as a second bubble bursts revealing within it, the leathery face of a corpse, in its burial clothes, rising like a weed straight out of the gushing mud. diane screams and backs into another face who’s mouth stretches open revealing tiny wire jaw clamps that make popping sounds like a jew’s harp. with a terrible slurp, the top of a metal coffin pushes out of the mud, its lid hinged open, tossing bones and dirt and burial jewelry all over diane.}
