<A>__{price hurries through the passageways between tin shacks, through tiny yards of goats and chickens, through houses as poor that the war has nearly passed them by. price is hurting, and looks around with fear to see: the guardia soldiers move down into the shantytown, fanning out to quickly engulf the barrio. they move quickly. a helicopter gunship moves in low over the barrio and opens up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to flee. price runs down an alley and nearly runs right into the guardia. he hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer cans the guardia move past him only inches away. price starts off in another direction, but guardia appear he is trapped in the barrio.}
