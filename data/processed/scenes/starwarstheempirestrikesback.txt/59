<A>__{general veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward. luke's speeder banks in from the side of veers's walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away. an explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm. the speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine.}
