<L>__{exterior medwar pine memorial hospital night}
<A>__{the arrive at the gates of the huge, victorian hospital. people sleep outside the gates.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor side room day}
<A>__{the wards are full, as are the corridors. patients on beds and stretchers everywhere. most have at least one member of their family to look over them. in a side room, max is arguing with a porter who tells him he can't help him. max slaps some rupees into the porter's hand, tells him to take him to the person in charge. shambu is fading. aloka smooths the sweat from his brow, trying to keep shambu alive by force of will and love. then max is back, standing over her with another man. it may take a moment before we recognize the attendant from the blood bank.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they'll admit him, but we have to pay for the blood. i gave him all i had. he wants more. do you have anything?}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{sister joan gave me this.}
<A>__{aloka holds out a fistful of rupees. the attendant blows through his lips, indicating it's a paltry sum. max grabs the money and shoves it at the attendant.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{we haven't got any more!}
<A>__{the attendant doesn't move... until he sees max is about to explode.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if this child dies while you stand here, i will kill you.}
<A>__{the attendant is smart enough not to push any further.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{now, i need an x ray room and i need an o.r. nurse.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{not possible. you can't give care, you're an american. you must be an indian doctor.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{then take me to one!}
<A>__{as max takes flight with the attendant, aloka strokes shambu and hasari hovers. we close in on shambu's inanimate face and hold a moment.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{max hurtles down the corridor with a young intern in tow. almost a kid, he's been up for days. but he's going to help.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{this way, please.}
<A>__{max scoops shambu up and rushes down the corridor behind the intern, leaving hasari and aloka looking after him. his arm comes around her shoulders.}
