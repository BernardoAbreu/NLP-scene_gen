<L>__{interior basement shul night}
<A>__{the synagogue is a claustrophobic, fluorescent lit room in general disarray. two rows of imitation wooden pews face a makeshift altar and ark. young hasidic men study texts. some work alone, reading and dovening. others are in small groups sharing in heated discussions. lenny wraps the tefillin around max's arm. max just wants to get out of there. ephraim prays in the background.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{lenny, i don't really want to do...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{do it for me? it means a lot, having someone of your stature performing a mitzvah in my presence.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when you told me your name was max cohen, i didn't realize you were the max cohen. maximilian cohen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know me?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{0f course, i've followed your research since your columbia days. it's revolutionary. you've inspired the work we do.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i have?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yes, very much so. the only difference is, we're not looking at stocks. we're searching for a pattern in torah.}
<A>__{lenny finishes wrapping max's arm. he reaches for another box and strap.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what kind of pattern?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{we're not really sure. our calculations have shown us that there is a number encoded in the texterior}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what sort of number?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{we don't know. all we know is that it's two hundred and sixteen digits long.}
<A>__{max, stunned looks at lenny.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{don't worry. this one just goes over your head.}
<A>__{lenny places the other teffilin over max's head. max collects himself.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{two sixteen?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yes. now we have to say a small prayer, repeat after me.}
<A>__{bewildered, max does. after the prayer...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{that's it. wasn't so bad, was it? you feel anything?}
<A>__{lenny starts removing the teffillin from max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{it's a prayer about our dedication to our one and only god.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(attempting calmness)}
<D>__{no, i mean the number, the two sixteen number? what is it?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{oh. we don't know. we just know that it's the most common number encoded in the texterior it might be some type of linguistic pattern. if we could figure out what the number is we could maybe answer that.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{tell me more.}
