<A>__{long shot. activity is winding down, a few sunbathers collecting their blankets. a solitary figure stands on a hill silhouetted by the sunset. a second figure appears on a footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man. gekko waits, expressionless... bud approaches him. they stand facing each other.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{hello bud.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{gordon.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{you sandbagged me on bluestar.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?}
<A>__{bud looks away. gekko's smile fades.}
<C>__{gekko }
<D>__{well let me cue you in: the ice is melting under your feet sport...}
<A>__{without warning, he grabs buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face.}
<C>__{gekko }
<D>__{you think you could've gotten this far this fast with anybody else? you think you could be out there dicking somebody like darien? no, you'd be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock! i took you in! a nobody! i opened doors for you!...i showed you how the system works!...}
<A>__{gekko slapping him harder and harder, buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.}
<C>__{gekko }
<D>__{...the value of information! how you get it! anacott steel, brant resources, transuniversal, fulham oil. and this is how you pay back, you cockroach! i gave you darien, i gave you your manhood. i gave you everything.}
<A>__{he backhands bud across the face. bud lies on the ground, spent, as is gordon breathing hard. bud gets to his knees, blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. passersby look on, wondering. gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. he hands bud a handkerchief. bud staunches the flow of blood from his nose.}
<C>__{gekko }
<P>__{(softly, innocently)}
<D>__{you could've been one of the great ones bud...i look at you and see myself...why?}
<A>__{bud looks at gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they share and the betrayal wrought.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(shakes his head, thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i don't know. my dad once told me, "money is something you need in case you don't die tomortow." i guess i realized i'm just bud fox. and as much as i wanted to be gordon gekko i will always be bud fox.}
<A>__{he looks at gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't. in long shot, gordon stands alone as bud walks away.}
