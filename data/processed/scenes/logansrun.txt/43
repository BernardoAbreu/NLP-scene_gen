<L>__{exterior cathedral itself}
<A>__{an area of rubble and dilapidated buildings. logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area, listening... sound: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady. logan gestures to jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the direction of the beeping, quartering occasionally like a hunting dog. coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off, puts the machine back onto his belt. he gestures to jessica to stand still then he straightens, steps out, calls:}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{runner!}
<A>__{silence. jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the runner moves from behind an upright and stands. the figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender. in the runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off. the runner is a woman! there is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly jessica gasps, grasping at him. as logan whirls:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling cubs materializes moving with blinding speed. at their appearance the runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. logan makes a futile gesture after her, then turns to face the cubs. a strutting, feral faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack, dressed in fierce looking tatters and hung with rip off trophies. he gestures to one of his followers to stand still.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(speaking of the runner)}
<D>__{don't worry about her. we'll have that one later. right now i think we've got a runner and his pairup. and what a runner!}
<A>__{the camera pans the other cubs...mean, filthy.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{we're going to have ourselves a time, we are. right, billy?!}
<A>__{there is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i'm a sandman!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i cut up a sandman yesterday. they said i'd never get him...but i cut him up good, i did.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(firm tone)}
<D>__{i feel sorry for you, boy!}
<A>__{some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{for me? better feel sorry for your self, sandman!}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no, for you! how old are you, billy?}
<A>__{billy is silent.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{fourteen? fifteen? your days are running out. how long can you last? a year. six months?}
<P>__{(he points to the yellow flower in billy's palm)}
<D>__{what happens when you're sixteen and you go green?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(lashing out)}
<D>__{nothing will happen! i make the rules as i go!! cubs do what i say! always have! always will! i got cathedral and i will never let go!}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no cubs over fifteen, billy! ever heard of a cub with a green flower? you'll leave cathedral then, billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.}
<P>__{(slightest beat)}
<D>__{if you try to stay the young ones will gut rip you apart!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{shut up! shut up your damn mouth!}
<A>__{logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building.}
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{let him suck muscle! that'll shut his mouth! let's watch him shake himself to death!!}
<A>__{we see the cubs take out drugpads. they squeeze the pads and inhale the "muscle." at once their movements become blurringly rapid. they take menacing positions some leaping overhead.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{give him some muscle!!}
<A>__{like lightning they change positions and flash around logan and jessica close on jessica watching..terrified. close on logan being held against the wall by cubs as:}
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{shake him to death!!}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{kill him!}
<A>__{another angle including billy moving a drugpad against logan's face. logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the "muscle" directly from the pad into his system.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(chilling laugh)}
<D>__{he's trying to hold his breath...}
<A>__{as billy presses the pad tighter against logan's face: with all his might, logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the ground and pulls out his gun. he fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{we can rush him...we can take can take him again, we can!!}
<A>__{the pack hesitates...stops backing away.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(moving the gun slowly back and forth)}
<D>__{all right! how many of you want this to be lastday?!}
<A>__{the pack moves back again...and disperses, leaving billy facing logan alone.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{come on, billy...come on...you cut a sandman, didn't you?!}
<A>__{logan tucks the gun back into his waist.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{come on, billy...cut me...come on}
<A>__{after a beat, billy turns and runs away. logan comforts the shivering jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts beeping. the camera pans logan and jessica...following the sound. they move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned buildings. we hear a scream...and hear the cubs who've only obviously found and attacked someone. the sound is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{they've got someone else! why would anybody come here?}
<A>__{jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly. the beeping is now very loud. logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down. we see the runner. the woman cringing, expecting death. full shot logan and the woman frozen for a moment. in f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is francis. his weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles. the is logan's job. close on jessica watching}
<B>__{logan and the woman}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(nearing hysteria)}
<D>__{there's been a terrible error! my lifeclock must have broken in some way!}
<P>__{(rising tone)}
<D>__{i'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...i'm twenty two. i should be green! did you hear me?}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{green!}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't be afraid }
<A>__{before logan can continue...the woman...who is now wild eyed and hysterical lunges at logan...and starts grappling with him.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i will kill you!! i will kill you!!}
<A>__{after logan pushes her away...and she falls down:}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(breathing hard)}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you.}
<A>__{slowly, she rises. logan takes out the ankh.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{sanctuary? anything?}
<A>__{logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object...the size of a large marble.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{if they find you throw this hard enough to break it. then hold your breath till you get away...it's blind gas.}
<A>__{her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks logan again. during the course of the struggle, logan subdues her again. jessica enters, bends over the near crazed runner as logan holds her. eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round object...she appears somewhat bewildered as logan and jessica move off.}
