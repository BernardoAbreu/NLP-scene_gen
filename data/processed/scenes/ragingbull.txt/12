<L>__{exterior gleason's gym next day}
<A>__{gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th street and 3rd avenue above a small sandwich shop. each day bobby gleason posts a small sign alongside the door listing the fighters who will be working out. jake's name is posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.}
<L>__{interior gleason's day}
<A>__{gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags. about a dozen managers train their fighters out at gleason's. for 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the workouts. jake is sparring with joey in the ring. they've been working out for a while now. the bell rings ending the third round. jake prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound again. at that moment, salvy, along with two other young "button" men (actually, they are very young about joey's age) enter the gym. they are well dressed (over coat, ties, suits, flashy rings, etc.). they say hello to some people by the door. jake looks over and notices them. salvy looks over to the ring.}
<C>__{salvy}
<P>__{(waves)}
<D>__{hey joey }
<A>__{joey waves back.}
<C>__{salvy }
<P>__{(waves again)}
<D>__{jake, how you doin'?}
<A>__{jake nods to salvy very cold. salvy notices and can feel that he's not exactly wanted there by jake. joey notices the same and becomes a bit nervous. salvy sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like to. his two friends, frankie and guido, sit nearby also. jake goes to joey's corner.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{did you know they were coming up here?}
<A>__{joey doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{answer me when i talk to you.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. they just wanted to talk to you. so i...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{don't ever bring those kids up here again! i'm working out, i'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.}
<A>__{salvy and the others see joey being chewed out by jake. they begin to feel unwelcome at the gym. the bell sounds. jake is more aggressive now as he corners joey. jake swings away with body punches. joey can't block them. salvy and the others watch. the bell sounds again. with that, salvy and the others start to leave.}
<C>__{salvy}
<P>__{(to joey)}
<D>__{hey joey, we better go. see you later.}
<A>__{joey, dazed, turns to wave.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{go 'head. wave goodbye. they're your friends.}
<A>__{jake watches them leave.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{and that hard on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard on come up here and act like a big shot.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what are you getting so hot about tommy como told him to come down here...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{hey, i don't care about tommy como. i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i gotta give them a percentage of what i make! i'm in here breaking my ass, not them. don't ever bring them up here again.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i didn't tell them to come. tommy como...}
<A>__{the bell sounds again. jake hits joey a few more solid body punches. joey gets angry and fights back with a flurry of punches which have no effect on jake. jake laughs.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's right, fight back. i got laid three times before i came up here this morning and i can still break your ass.}
<A>__{joey fights back, but it's no use.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you cocksucker.}
<A>__{jake laughs. the two continue to swing it out, as salvy watches unseen from the doorway.}
