<D>__{and now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.}
<A>__{albert has been meticulously preparing everything, positioning joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty plow in the earth. he takes his position behind the plow, throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{see joey i got the collar, too!}
<A>__{albert gently snaps the reins. joey doesn't move, confused by the whole affair.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{come on, boy. walk on. that's it. walk on! walk on, joey. come on, boy, walk on.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down! gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{walk on, joey! walk on! come on, joey, walk on. walk on, boy.}
<A>__{at the house, mrs. narracott opens an upstairs window to look on, anxiously. ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks at albert.}

<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to himself:)}
<D>__{it'll take the whip to move him.}
<A>__{just as ted is saying this, albert, as if hearing his father, takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip. joey's ears prick up. albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at joey. joey panics and bolts. the plow spins to its side, pulls albert off his feet. joey drags them all the way to the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse. lyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{bravo! you've reached the top of the hill! off you go again, boy! you'll make even better time comin' down!!}
<A>__{he continues past dad, laughing.}
