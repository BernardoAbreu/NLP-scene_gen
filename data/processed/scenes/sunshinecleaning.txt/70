<L>__{interior albuquerque blood services building day}
<A>__{lynn steps into an elevator. norah does too.}
<L>__{interior albuquerque blood services building elevator day}
<A>__{the doors close. lynn slaps the `stop elevator' button. norah emits a small yelp.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{why are you following me?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i'm not following you.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you are following me!}
<A>__{lynn freezes for a moment. it seems she isn't even breathing. her anger twists into fear.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{aren't you?}
<A>__{norah remains silent. lynn paces back and forth.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{oh no.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{shit! this is not happening.}
<A>__{norah is uncomfortable. lynn spins around to face norah.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{listen, i'm sorry. i thought... i thought you were following me.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<A>__{lynn steps closer.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you think i'm crazy.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{no. no i don't.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i'm not crazy.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it was a mistake. no big deal.}
<A>__{lynn smiles. norah releases the stop button. nothing happens.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{it's not moving.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{let's press the alarm button.}
<A>__{lynn shrugs. norah presses the alarm button. there's a loud quick ring. they wait for something to happen. an awkward silence hangs in the air. norah gives it another quick punch for good measure. smiles. they look at the ceiling. they look at the floor. norah makes little noises. norah takes out her sign language book. she steals a quick sideways look at lynn before settling on the series of small, illustrated hands before her.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{go to the university?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{me? no.}
<A>__{lynn leans close and checks out the book.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{hobby...}
<A>__{lynn sizes norah up.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{there's this gorilla who knows sign language and i've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. you know? to actually talk to a gorilla.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i think i've seen something on }
<A>__{norah nods.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{koko.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, with the kitten.}
<A>__{norah offers a sad nod.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{kitten died. it wasn't koko's fault. she was heartbroken.}
<A>__{a knocking sound reverberates through the elevator.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{kind of weird, don't you think? teaching a gorilla to talk. probably, gorillas aren't supposed to talk.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{that's what's so cool about it.}
<A>__{lynn takes a long bold look at norah. norah sweats. the elevator moves.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i'm sorry again about the...}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{no, don't... it's fine.}
<A>__{lynn lightly touches the crook of norah's arm.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you've got nice veins.}
<A>__{norah smiles self consciously. she's flustered. not a familiar sensation. the doors open to the "albuquerque blood services."}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you should give blood.}
<A>__{lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a rack. she glances back with a smile just as the doors close.}
