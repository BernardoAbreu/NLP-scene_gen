<ACTION>__{Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated, the congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a reservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the line.  PAN ahead to... ... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant service.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving by far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose person they screen from our view.  We can see, however... ... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the table.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes, an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and conservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess it.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us... ... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled together in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile, scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an original beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender expressive fingers, which point to...}

He has Julianne in his arms.  Holding her so tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad from the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her ear...}
