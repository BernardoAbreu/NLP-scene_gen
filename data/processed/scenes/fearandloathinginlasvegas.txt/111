<L>__{interior north star coffee lounge night}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms. no hassles, no talk. just a place to rest and regroup. i wasn't even hungry.}
<A>__{gonzo stuffs a hamburger down paying no attention to the beating going on outside the window. duke reads a newspaper.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{there was nothing in the atmosphere of the north star to put me on my guard...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(to waitress)}
<D>__{two glasses of ice water with ice.}
<A>__{the waitress brings the ice water.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{she looked like a burnt out caricature of jane russell. she was definitely in charge here...}
<A>__{gonzo gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{he did it very casually, but i knew that our peace was about to be shattered.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{gonzo shrugs. the waitress stands at the end of the counter with her back to them while she ponders the napkin... she turns.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{a napkin.}
<A>__{the waitress slams the napkin down on the counter.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{don't give me that bullshit! i know what it means! you goddamn fat pimp bastard.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{that's the name of a horse i used to own. what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you sonofabitch! i take a lot of shit in this place, but i sure as hell don't have to take it off a spic pimp!}
<B>__{gonzo goes very very still at this...}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{jesus. i thought, what's happening?}
<A>__{duke picks up the napkin. on it is printed in careful red letters: "back door beauty?"}
<P>__{duke (v o cont'd)}
<D>__{the question mark was emphasized.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{pay your bill and get the hell out! you want me to call the cops?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{spic pimp?}
<A>__{gonzo's hand goes inside his shirt. he pulls out the razor }
<B>__{sharp hunting knife.}
<A>__{gonzo keeps his eyes on the waitress. he walks about six feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone. he slices it off, then brings the receiver back to his stool and sits down.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{how much is the lemon meringue pie?}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(blurting on automatic)}
<D>__{thirty five cents!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i mean the whole pie.}
<A>__{the waitress moans. gonzo places a $5 bill on the counter.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{let's say five dollars. okay?}
<A>__{gonzo walks round the counter taking the pie out of the}
<B>__{display case.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{the sight of the blade had triggered bad memories. the glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut. she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.}
<B>__{duke is rooted to the spot.}
<A>__{gonzo urges him out the door. the camera retreats with them. the waitress stands there petrified. alone in a lousy bar at night.}
