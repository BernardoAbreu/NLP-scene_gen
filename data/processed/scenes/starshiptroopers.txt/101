<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{carmen... ?}

<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{oh... at ease. guess i oughta lose the hat when i'm off duty, eh ?}

<A>__{johnny turns to leave.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{johnny, wait...}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{forget it, carmen. the mobile infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short tempered, thoughtless and rude.}
<A>__{johnny turns back to face zander.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{you heard me. wanna make something out of it, private ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{not with an officer, no, sir. the m.i. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.}
<A>__{everyone can see what's about to happen. a circle is forming, fleet on one side, mobile infantery on the other.}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{let's disregaed rank... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here.}
<C>__{carmen}

<C>__{zander}
<D>__{it's alright. what's he gonna do ?}
<A>__{wham ! johnny punches him right in the nose. zander goes down, bleeding. ace and kitten smith grab johnny.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{whoa, easy there, buddy... nice punch.}
<A>__{zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but fleet officers pull him back. carmen looks at johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{what's wrong with you ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.}
<A>__{carmen turns away, stung. johnny immediately regrets. dizzy, for her part, couldn't be happier.}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{forget it, johnny. cap troopers and fleet weren't meant to mix !}
