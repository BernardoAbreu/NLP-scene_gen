<L>__{interior hotel suite atlantic city night}
<A>__{waking is slow for mitch henessey. he swallows dryly. eyes creak open, struggle to focus... hears water running. a shower. squints at his watch. he's not wearing a watch, he knew that... in bed, naked. chest swathed in bandages, what the hell...? he pokes them. jerks his head, hissing in pain.}
<L>__{exterior living room of suite with henessey night}
<A>__{henessey lights a smoke at the bar. flicks the match in a trashcan. starts to go, stops... reaches into the can. plucks out a tiny scrap: photograph, ripped in two. a photo of hal and caitlin. he pockets it, disturbed. crosses to the bathroom door. the shower has stopped. raises a tentative hand, starts to knock... it opens. there, in a thin silk robe, is a woman, swabbing at her hair. she breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's unusual. notices henessey cursorily. raises a finger: "one sec." lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying him. he cannot stop staring. it's samantha, it has to be... now she's blonde, though. hair clipped short. bobbed. blood red fingernails. red cotton shift, legs for days. then, she smiles at him and it's not her, not samantha. amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a changed woman: this one's name is charly baltimore, and she hasn't seen the light of day in eight years.}

<A>__{she grabs a washcloth. frowns, says:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{here, look at this.}
<A>__{with that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts. henessey perks up considerably then screams as she rips the gauze from his chest. she clinchs the robe again.}
