<A>__{the high tech room hums at a different frequency now. indicator lights green and ready. vickers throws switches. four hibernation pods slide out of the metal walls. from each pod, a muscular soldier rouses from sleep. they are scarred and crew cut. tough customers. they wake like veterans. their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. this is captain shepherd, a career mercenary who has followed the highest paycheck to this strange duty.}

<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what is that?}
<B>__{e.v.a. room}
<A>__{the prep room inside the airlocks. a soldier, vigoda, waits there: a slim dark man with an air of calm. holloway and watts arrive in civilian clothes, perplexed.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{where is everybody? we can't }
<P>__{(he stops short)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{vigoda}
<D>__{captain janek took his crew out to retrieve his missing men. they never came in.}

<C>__{vigoda}
<D>__{haven't been out yet. i understand it's in some kind of pyramid.}

<D>__{they're my personnel. on my ship.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what are the guns for?}
<A>__{vickers looks at them unflappably. sure of her ground now.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i'm being careful. these new finds give our work a new importance.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you should have talked to us. martin's mission leader. that's in our contract.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{the second you found alien technology, control of this mission reverted to me. that's in your contract too.}
<A>__{watts and holloway exchange grim looks. vickers has them.}
<C>__{vickers }
<D>__{mr. weyland's pouring trillions into mars. he's spent a fortune building ships like the magellan to search for colony planets. but earthlike worlds are vanishingly rare. the right distance from the sun, the right atmosphere, enough water...}
<A>__{she glances across the suite at her holographic display: a live feed from the pyramid worksite, where david works on the terraforming equipment.}
<C>__{vickers }
<D>__{this is a technology to transform worlds. he'll never give it up.}
<P>__{(she turns to face them)}
