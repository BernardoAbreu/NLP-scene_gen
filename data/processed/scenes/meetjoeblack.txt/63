<L>__{interior library, parrish townhouse late afternoon}
<A>__{parrish is playing solitaire. the sound of the front door closing, heels crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer door is susan.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{hello, honey.}
<A>__{he starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks around now.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where's joe?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe?}
<A>__{a silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{joe's not around.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{susan seems distracted.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{why are you looking for joe?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{because i was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{love. passion. obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. well, they've arrived.}
<A>__{parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{this is crazy }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{why? a man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, i sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you don't know anything about joe }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are you afraid of, dad? that i will fall head over heels for joe well, i have as you did with mom.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{that's always been standard, whether you like or not.}
<A>__{parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{susan, i don't think joe is going to be with us long.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where's he going?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't know, i can't say }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{c'mon! the guy's working with you. you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{in this case, i can't. i uh i just can't help you. i only would tell you that with joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.}
<A>__{susan doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i love him.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't care if you love him! i'm telling you he's no good for you!}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{of course not, daddy. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{there is something in susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in. parrish slumps.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i love you, too.}
<A>__{she kisses parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards, shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays down a card parrish needs.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{lightning does strike.}
<A>__{parrish watches as susan turns, disappears out the door.}
