<L>__{interior pete's cadillac morning}
<A>__{cruising up the topanga canyon. almost home...}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{shaking to see her, touch her...}
<L>__{exterior bungalow morning}
<A>__{door locked. knocking. pete opens up. standing drunk. a pissed off nod.}
<L>__{interior bungalow next moment}
<A>__{liquor wafts off of him.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you go to bed drunk, or just been up all night.}
<A>__{no answer as i follow him into the house.}
<C>__{klein}
<D>__{where's glenda, is she asle }
<A>__{ round the corner: glenda shaking but refusing to cry. i go pale: what is this? somebody to the left, look: milteer. look back at pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with a right cross.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{seen pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: god help me if he ever hits me like that...}
<A>__{instant drop, moan. glenda screaming.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{don't kill me.}
<A>__{pete looks to milteer, wipes blurred eyes.}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{the harder you hit him the quicker i say `stop' and cease that absurd crying.}
<A>__{pete bludgeons me. i try to get closer to glenda. feel my nose shatter. another swing: right cheek detonates. a left hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes. glenda's crying screaming gets me madder than anything.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<P>__{(at milteer)}
<D>__{that impotent shit }
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{ touch me and he dies.}
<A>__{pete knocks me down again. my face in pieces.}
<C>__{milteer }
<D>__{kick him kick him kick him.}
<A>__{pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3 }
<C>__{milteer }
<P>__{(prim, official)}
<D>__{ you may stop.}
<P>__{(beat, for the room)}
<D>__{howard determined that this was the price for your time together.}
<A>__{milteer produces a polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered husk, hands the camera to pete on his way out:}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{you still have a job.}
<A>__{milteer gone. i spit volumes of blood. i will talk with a slur for the next year. pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{...i'm sorry dave...}
<A>__{pushing out words past shattered teeth.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i put you here...that powerhawk }
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{ there's a body in the trunk }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ burn it.}
<A>__{big drunk nod from pete. glenda panicking, trying to stanch blood that keeps rushing. pete, reeling drunk, leans down, stuffs something in my jacket.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm so sorry....}
