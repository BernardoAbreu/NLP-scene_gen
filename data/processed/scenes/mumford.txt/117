<L>__{exterior back door, follett's pharmacy day}
<A>__{there is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. when a young pharmacist appears in there, mumford raps on the metal screen.}
<L>__{interior henry follett's office day}
<A>__{follett's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore. when you sit at his desk and in front of it, as follett and mumford are doing now, you can see down into the store through a floor to ceiling, one way mirror. the fed ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's a thought i had.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{should i open it now?}
<A>__{mumford seems hesitant, but nods. follett takes out an exacto knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go on, mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{let me just say something here... i have no idea if this is going to help.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{what exactly is it supposed to do?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you remember when i asked you about pornography }
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{ i find it degrading. maximum gynecology and minimum turn on }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{ and you told me that. still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, i think, getting in your way }
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{ which i don't necessarily agree.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{but you did come to me.}
<A>__{follett reacts. it's true, even if he keeps forgetting.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you maybe you could get past them... anyway, i thought we could try an experiment.}
<C>__{follett}
<P>__{(indicating the box)}
<D>__{and the experiment is in here?}
<A>__{mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you know what? i think this was a dumb idea...}
<A>__{he starts to take hold of the box.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{...i just heard myself talking and i realize i'm completely unqualified to be doing this. let's forget the whole thing.}
<A>__{follett grabs the box back.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, what are you doing? i want to know what's in here.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(pulling on the box)}
<D>__{there's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. i'm embarrassed to have }
<A>__{follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. loud }
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{hey! i agree with you that you don't know what you're talking about. that's what i've been saying all along. and i can guarantee you that looking at the lost ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me...}
<P>__{(quieting down)}
<D>__{...but if you think i'm going to let you walk out of here without seeing what's in this box, you don't know much about henry a. follett.}
<A>__{mumford gives up. follett gestures to ask whether it's safe to put the box on the desk; mumford reassures him. now, with much more anticipation and ceremony than before, follett carefully cuts open the package. the contents of the box is revealed as follett opens the flaps. there is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low rent catalogue: "metropolitan collectibles periodicals, erotica, adult nostalgia." follett lifts away the wrapping there are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties and early sixties: nugget, adam, the adam reader, swank, dude. plus several cartoon collections: sex to sexty, stag humor. plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative illustrations on the covers: night call nurse, the neighbors have no curtains, secretarial sluts, etc. finally, two video tapes, both of russ meyer films: mudhoney and common law}
<B>__{cabin.}
<A>__{we stay close on the contents of the box as follett's hands shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. very soft core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: voluptuous, heavy breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out of them) tempting muscular, he man drifters or libidinous businessmen. a world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, and frustrated, neglected wives. in other words, exactly the erotic ambience of follett's fantasies. slow tilt up to follett's face. he is transported, mesmerized, galvanized. in fact, at this moment, as the music swells, a tear is rolling down his cheek. he dare not take his eyes from this holy grail to look up at mumford. the only thing that could wreck his mood now, is }
<C>__{young pharmacist }
<D>__{mr. follett }
<A>__{follett jumps, startled from his revery. as the young pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{what?! what the hell is so important i can't have five minutes ?}
<A>__{the young pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the room.}
<C>__{young pharmacist}
<D>__{it's her, sir. you told me to get you when she came to pick up her prescription.}
<A>__{it takes follett a moment to understand, but when he does, his whole manner changes. he dismisses the young pharmacist with a nod, then gives a quick, self conscious glance to mumford.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{uh, sorry, i'm going to have to...}
<P>__{(indicates box)}
<D>__{...i really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, i can't thank you enough for...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{i will see you on... whatever...}
<A>__{he hurries out. mumford stands up to leave, but first looks down through the one way mirror. what he sees: follett hurries up behind the prescription counter, where althea brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy. follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting. althea is responsive. follett motions althea down the aisle, where it's more private. he comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show althea something on the prescription bottle. althea leans back against some shelves in the same posture as the landlady in follett's first fantasy. mumford reacts, bemused.}
