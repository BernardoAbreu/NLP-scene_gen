<A>__{ the whole church is singing, men to one side: women to the other. monroe conducts, sings. inman is there, as is ada. he fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls. the door bursts open. young oakley, apologetic nod to monroe, sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing continues, to say something to rourke, who says something to butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. rourke gets up, leaves. butcher gets up next, follows. another man. another. depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the older men are singing and one side of the church is practically empty. inman, remains, fixed on ada. who does not look round.}
