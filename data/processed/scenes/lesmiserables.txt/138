<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{on this page i write my last confession. read it well when i at last am sleeping. it's the story of one who turned from hating a man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping.}
<A>__{cosette takes the letter and kisses it.}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{i know it, papa.}
<A>__{valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. there he sees three ghosts waiting for him. the ghost of the bishop. the ghost of fantine. and beyond her, watching marius with love, the ghost of eponine. fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i'm ready now, fantine.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{come with me where chains will never bind you all your grief at last, at last behind you lord in heaven look down on him in mercy }
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{forgive me all my trespasses and take me to your glory!}
<A>__{cosette embraces valjean, weeping. valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of fantine take them.}
<D>__{fantine eponine take my hand i will lead you to salvation take my love for love is everlasting... valjean fantine eponine bishop and remember the truth that once was spoken: to love another person is to see the face of god...}
<A>__{led by fantine, valjean walks out of the chapel towards the cloister. what remains is cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the man who has just died. the walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles. the bishop of digne waits in front of the candles. now valjean's strong and young again. before they reach the wall of candles, all three are gone. as they disappear we crane up, high over the cloister, high over the walls of the convent and we see the paris streets outside. fires are burning and debris is scattered in the streets. dawn is breaking. from far away, the sound of an approaching crowd }
