<L>__{interior mills' apartment, living room kitchenette night}
<A>__{tracy leads somerset into the disarray of the apartment.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{david went for a walk. to clear his head. oh, you can put those here.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tracy motions and somerset puts the books on mills' desk. he starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{could you tell him... tell him this is his reading assignment. it's urgent. i've marked the most important pages.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{would you like some coffee, or a drink. david should be back any minute.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i do have to get going.}
<A>__{somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens and pencils. he picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the philadelphia police department.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{at least i got to meet you. david has told me a lot about you.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{really? good things, i hope.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{oh, yes. he said you were very smart.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i think he's a bit intimidated by you.}
<A>__{somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe. he goes through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i'm going to leave him a list of specifics. it all relates to the case he's on.}
<A>__{he lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits to start writing on the notepad. tracy goes to the kitchenette to get a chair.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you two aren't working together anymore. isn't that so?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{to be perfectly honest, mrs. mills...}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{tracy.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{tracy. david and i weren't exactly what you could call fast friends.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<A>__{tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits. somerset looks up from his writing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i doubt your husband shares that opinion.}
<A>__{tracy nods, leaning forward, semi conspiratorially.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you know, somerset, david is very... determined. i'm sure you've seen, it's not likely he'll ever be compared to gandhi.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{he's a good cop. he just...}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{he sees policework as a crusade. that's what he wants it to be, and, that might sound naive, but he's made a conscious choice to be naive.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{believe me, his heart's in the right place.}
<A>__{somerset pauses, enchanted by her.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i hear you and he were high school sweethearts.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{yeah. pretty hokey, huh? but, what girl wouldn't want the captain of the football team as their lifelong mate?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{it's rare these days... that kind of commitment.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{tracy's smile falters a bit. somerset notices this. he breaks from her spell, turns to continue writing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{well... this will only take a minute.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{take your time.}
<A>__{somerset writes. tracy looks over the stack of books: titles on the spines: bosch, a history of christian art, bregel the elder, etc. hardcover novels: dante's purgatory and the}
<B>__{canterbury tales.}
<A>__{tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of paper scraps from somerset's pocket. she picks up the piece of wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{somerset looks up. sees her holding the paper rose. he takes it, slightly self conscious, looks at it.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{my future.}
<A>__{tracy tilts her head, looking at somerset.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you have a strange way about you, somerset... i mean in a good way... unusual.}
<A>__{somerset doesn't know what to say. he pockets the paper rose.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{i apologize. i will get out of your hair.}
<A>__{tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{it's just... it's nice to hear a man who talks like that. if david saw that paper, he'd say you're acting like a homosexual. that's how he is.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(mock indignation)}
<D>__{well! i guess i won't be showing this to him then.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i suppose not.}
