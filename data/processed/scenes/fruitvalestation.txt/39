<L>__{interior grandma bonnie's house den hours later}
<A>__{everyone is finishing up their cake, it's about half gone now. oscar sits on the couch between wanda and sophina. ceephus and daryl now sit in plush chairs with metal frames pulled up next to the coffee table. grandma bonnie sits in a recliner at the foot of the coffee table.}
<C>__{grandma bonnie}
<D>__{if somebody told me say twenty years ago, that i would live to see it happen, i'd have laughed in their face.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{if somebody would have told me that two years ago i would have laughed in their face.}
<C>__{daryl}
<D>__{and here we are. 2008 and its happened.}
<C>__{ceephus}
<D>__{but i think it's a sign of the times. the country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. look, if bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. would he have even had a shot?}
<C>__{daryl}
<D>__{i think he still would have had a shot.}
<C>__{ceephus}
<D>__{but would he have won though?}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{well, i'm happy the did win. if the country really is as messed up as you say, i think he's our best chance of fixing it.}
<C>__{sophina}
<D>__{i keep thinking about how much it means for t.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{when i was coming up, teachers used to love to tell me, "you can be the president of the united states."}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{you'd make a great politician. you can talk your way out of anything.}
<A>__{sophina and oscar share a look.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{but i will never forget, in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster. it had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang. and i looked at all they faces. and it was all white dudes. at that point, i realized my teachers was lying to me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since.}
<C>__{daryl}
<D>__{now there will be a black face on those posters.}
<C>__{grandma bonnie}
<D>__{well let's let him get in there first.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{i know, i still feel like it's just too good to be true.}
<C>__{ceephus}
<D>__{what's so good about it?}
<C>__{daryl}
<D>__{a black man, one of us has been elected president, fair and square.}
<A>__{ceephus shakes his head at this.}
<C>__{ceephus}
<D>__{but he's not one of us. he wasn't affected by slavery.}
<A>__{wanda has had enough of this. she stands up and starts to grab everyone's plates. she heads into the kitchen to wash. oscar watches her for a beat, then follows after her.}
