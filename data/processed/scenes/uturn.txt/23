<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{just banged my head. it was an accident.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{another accident? you got to be more careful.}
<A>__{bobby rolls his eyes. then notices the front fenders have been removed.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the hell happened to my car?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{bottom hose was shot too. rotted clear through. had to put a new one in. runs like a dream now.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred fifty bucks.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how much!?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{hundred fifty.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{to replace a goddamn radiator hose!?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty four and a half mustang. you know how long it took me to find that hose?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{about an hour and a half, because that's all the longer i've been gone.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{actually, it's been about three hours. you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. what you expect but fancy damn prices?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's a ford, not a ferrari. you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{"that's not just a ford, that's a sixty four and a half mustang."}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what's that got to do with the radiator hose?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{i don't know, but "it's the reason i'm living here and you're just passing through." now you owe me a hundred fifty dollars.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it might as well be fifteen hundred dollars, because i don't have the money.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{then you ain't gonna have the car.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{listen, man. i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had.}
<A>__{bobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from darrell. he fishes out a five dollar bill. then digs out a bloody one dollar bill from his pocket.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i've got five...six dollars.}
<A>__{darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of greasy bills he carries in his overalls.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{then you're only a hundred forty five in the hole. you can keep that dollar. now why don't you just take your american express gold card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't have a goddamn credit card.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{now that's too bad. i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.}
<A>__{bobby proffers his movado watch.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look, i got a movado. it's worth at least seven, eight hundred. you could sell it for that.}
<C>__{darrell }
<D>__{who the hell to? shit, can't see no numbers.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't need numbers. that's why it's expensive. look at the gold.}
<A>__{darrell doubts that, shake his head.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{...got no day, got no date. probably ain't worth a duck's fart (proffers his own watch). this one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. no sir i will stick with this (walks away).}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you son of a bitch! i will have my lawyers shut you down.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{you ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. sweet talk me all you want. didn't you read the sign? it says...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what sign? fuck the sign. i want my car.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{i want my hundred and forty five dollars.}
<A>__{bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or not to fight for the car, then wheels and walks away. darrell looks at him, smirks.}
