<L>__{exterior snow's island encampment morning}
<A>__{day breaks. a low, thick swamp mist covers the encampment. marion, sits alone by the embers of last night's campfire. the men are awake. some eat, others talk. marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie. he takes the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch attached to his weapons' belt. then he rises and heads over to the men. he surveys his brigade. twenty six men: framers, artisans, mountain men, none in uniform. marion walks among them, nodding familiarly to several. he notices an imposing looking cherokee indian, brother joseph, standing a bit apart from the others. they exchange nods. he notices a stern looking man in partial clerical garb,}

<D>__{i heard about your son. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{marion accepts his condolences. he notes george dalton, a tough looking, rustic man with an ice cold, distant stare.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{dalton.}
<A>__{dalton doesn't respond. marion recognizes another face, abner brown, african american, around thirty, rugged. marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much as just give him their attention.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you all have your own reasons for being here. i lost a son and i intend to kill the man who killed him...}
<A>__{marion pauses and looks over at gabriel.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... but i don't consider that man's life adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won't keep the sons of other men from dying...}
<A>__{gabriel nods, approvingly.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{cornwallis has to move north. we have to keep him right here. if he's south of the chesapeake when the french arrive, if the french arrive, we have a chance of winning this war.}
<A>__{marion looks from face to face.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{eat, get some rest, we move out in two hours.}
<A>__{marion heads back to his campsite, passing gabriel without looking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him.}
