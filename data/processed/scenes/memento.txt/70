<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i don't even know how long she's been gone. it's like i've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. but somehow i just know that she'll never come back to bed. i lie here, not knowing how long i've been alone. if i could just reach out and touch her side of the bed i could know that it was cold, but i can't. i have no idea when she left.}
<A>__{natalie's eyes are open.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{i know i can't have her back, but i want to be able to let her go. i don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. i want time to pass, but it won't. how can i heal if i can't feel time?}
<A>__{leonard bends his head around to see if natalie is awake. she closes her eyes. leonard gingerly slides from underneath her and moves silently out of the bedroom.}
