<L>__{interior large room of minaret day}
<A>__{two dozen people are laying down, being treated by shiite clerics in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters. at the end of the hall, archie grits his teeth in pain as a cleric uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his infected wound. archie screams in pain. doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm ok. i'm cool. i'm a survivor.}
<A>__{a shiite changes vig's bloody bandage, while a dead body is laid next to vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{is that guy dead? where you gonna put him?}
<C>__{shiite cleric}
<D>__{a shrine.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{what kind of shrine ya'll got?}
<C>__{shiite cleric}
<D>__{shrine that wash 700 year of sin.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{hey, that's a pretty good shrine, right, doc?}
<A>__{doc stares at vig.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{i'm sorry i hit you, man. i was scared for troy, i don't want nothing to happen to him, he's my friend. doc? come on, man, i know you was comin' to help me }
<A>__{vig reaches out blindly for doc's hand. doc looks for a moment at vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it. they remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{maybe we got kicked out of the ring of jesus fire, on account of stealing.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's not how it works.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{how does it work?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i take care of what jesus puts in front of me. that's what we did with the gold.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{what about now?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm gonna see.}
<A>__{archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects vig's face.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{how you doing, conrad?}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{i'm good to go, chief.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{let's check the suitcases.}
<A>__{archie, doc, and vig check the vuitton suitcases, opening them, looking at the gold, shutting them. pan to children in bandages watch archie inventory the gold.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we're missing 28.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{that leaves 92 suitcases, five bars each }
<A>__{they think.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{23 million dollars. not bad for a disaster, provided we can find barlow, get back before dark and not get busted.}
<A>__{he looks at doc and vig.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{it was my choice today. so you can head back if you want. i will find barlow myself.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what about the gold?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{take what you can carry. try to find a vehicle. bury what you have outside camp. be careful about it.}
<A>__{they look at archie.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{i want to find troy.}
<A>__{doc thinks.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm in.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{ok, where does that leave us? we don't have any water, we're dehydrated. you got a radio here?}
<A>__{the shiite man in glasses puts oils on his little girl's face.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{how is she?}
<A>__{the shiite man in glasses does not answer.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{how is your little girl?}
<A>__{vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the girl.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{broken arms. girl.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{she's traumatized, what the fuck do you expect?}
<A>__{they look at him, surprised.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{i went to b school at bowling green.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{what's b school? is that like terrorist training?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{business school, conrad.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{i came back to open a couple of hotels near karbala. i'm almost in the black when saddam starts this stupid fucking war and you guys bomb the shit out of my cafes. now we try to get rid of saddam, bush leaves us twisting in the wind, un be fucking lievable man.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{you got a radio?}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{no radio. no water.}
<A>__{he wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{where's barlow?}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{they got him, i saw it happen. and they won't take him back to the same place.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{where would they take him?}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{oasis bunker. it's full of saddam's hard core guys.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{where's that?}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{like 17 18 klicks from here.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{take us there.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{we got no wheels.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we'll walk until we find some.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{why don't you call in the marines?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{with what? we don't have a radio.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{ok, we'll find a vehicle. you drive back to get the choppers, they fly in to get your man.}
<A>__{doc and vig look at archie.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we can't do that.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{why not? you got a huge army here.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we're not supposed to be involved with shiites. we killed iraqi soldiers. we broke the peace accord.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{tell them it happened when you reclaimed the gold. don't tell them it was about us.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{they'd find out, we'd go to jail.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{you know what i think? i think maybe you're boosting the gold. that's what i think.}
<A>__{archie looks at him.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{they got half a million men in the desert, they send four guys to pick up all this bullion? i don't think so.}
<A>__{archie looks at vig and doc.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we need to find our man. how much do you want to take us there?}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{fifteen suitcases.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{that's too much.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{give it to him. we've got a lot.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we're gonna need it to buy our way back today, so we better spend it wisely. i will give you eight.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{you need some guns, right? you lost your gear.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{yeah, we need some guns.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{you need some fighters, too. i mean, you can try to take oasis on your own, but look at these grunts }
<A>__{doc and vig look pissed. archie's arm is in pain.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{yeah, ok, we need some fighters.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{so that's worth more than eight suitcases.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{ten.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{fifteen.}
<A>__{archie looks at him.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{that's four million dollars.}
<C>__{man in glasses}
<D>__{i think we need it more than you, john doe, don't you?}
<A>__{he extends his hand. they shake.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{archie gates.}
<C>__{imam }
<D>__{imam katar. i will give you back five suitcases to get us over the iranian border.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{we gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead. the camps are in iran.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we can't go to the iranian border.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{then we don't have a deal.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{give me a fucking break, man.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we saved your life.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{and we saved yours.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{we lost a man for you.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{what good is it if you leave us to get wasted? the big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator. you saw what happened to my wife. look at my daughter.}
<A>__{archie looks around. he sees imam's daughter, other bandaged children looking at him. a few mothers.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{who's going?}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{everyone but the priests. that's}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{fuck it. we'll find this place on our own.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{it's not on a map. you can look.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{somebody else will take us.}
<A>__{doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{who will take us to oasis bunker?}
<A>__{fifty shiites turn and look at him silently. doc dumps a whole suitcase of gold bars. imam translates.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{jarat yalam fantam uraz.}
<A>__{people stare at the gold and say nothing.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{this is a human life we're talking about.}
<C>__{imam}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{his daughter looks at him and laughs until her laughter becomes scary, hysterical and imam tries to hold her still and she won't stop as archie, doc, vig watch.}
