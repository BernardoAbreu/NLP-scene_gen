<L>__{interior starks' hospital room, december 26th}
<A>__{a nurse is checking on starks as he slowly wakes up.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me?}
<A>__{starks is asking the nurse, but it's becker's voice that answers though starks can't see him.}
<D>__{becker [o.s.] just something to help you sleep.}
<A>__{starks panics when he hears the voice. he looks around nervously but the bright sunlight pouring into the room is blinding. he swallows as he looks at the nurse's face as she continues adjusting his pillows.}
<D>__{starks [swallowing nervously] did you say something?}
<A>__{the nurse shakes her head lightly and just then becker steps out of the light.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i said the drugs were to help you sleep. [beat] did you sleep well?}
<A>__{becker is remarkably calm, further confusing starks' sense of reality.}
<D>__{starks [doubtfully] but i wasn't asleep. was i?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{yes. you were. you were asleep for nearly a whole day. it's december 26th, william.}
<A>__{starks sits up groggily, remembering what happened to him and wondering how much, if any of it, was real.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{it's december 26th?}
<A>__{starks examines himself looking at his arms, spotting the bruises on them.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{that's right, william. starks [slowly figuring it out] 1992?}
<A>__{becker nods. starks sits up his predicament and the room slowly coming into focus.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{yes. [caustically] and that's the sun and you're on earth. [beat] and i know you know better.}
<A>__{starks begins to piece if together. becker, as we begin to see, is right. it is 1992 in alpine grove.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't know better. all i know is that you left me in there.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{in where?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[uncertainly] in that thing...the jacket.}
<A>__{the nurse gives becker a knowing look suggesting starks really is delusional. becker doesn't even flinch as starks tries to get a better look at becker's face.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{we were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that wasn't a fucking restrainterior}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.}
<A>__{starks' eyes widen with alarm as becker reaches for the i.v. in his arm, lingering on it long enough that starks braces himself for an attack of some sort. but becker just looks back innocently as he adjusts it.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{relax.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{don't act like i don't know what's real. [beat] i'm not the one that's crazy here.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{[pointedly] of course you're not.}
<A>__{then he clarifies, wryly enough for starks to catch it.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{don't give me that. i know what's real, goddamnit! you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.}
<A>__{becker nods diagnostically. the nurse's nonchalance about it as she leaves the room further disquiets starks.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't dream it. i may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream.}
<A>__{becker sits down in a chair, half shrouded in the light.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i had a patient a few years ago. his name was ted casey...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about your patient!}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i wasn't pausing to see if you did. [beat] but, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.}
<A>__{starks squints as he searches out becker's face.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{ted raped and sodomized a seven year old girl. [beat] his lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his deeds were done... he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog. he couldn't even remember his name when i spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back. [beat] ted never went to prison because everyone including me was convinced he was sick. so he came here.}
<A>__{becker leans into starks' view to make sure he's listening. starks is.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and i caught ted stealing looks at her the kind you really have to steal if you know what i mean. [beat] i asked ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had... slain ...was wearing. [beat] he gave me a look i will never forget, and, when he answered, it wasn't with a color or any sort of physical description i'd expect. "oh yes," he said. "i remember it. i remember it well." [beat] those were actually his last words i think.}
<A>__{becker's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and remorse as he recounts ted's tale.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{we are not birds of a feather.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{maybe not. [beat] but i do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. and i'm just trying to help you the only way i can think of.}
<A>__{becker gets up and, as he moves out of the light, starks sees his bandaged cheek, reinforcing his memory of what happened...}
<D>__{starks [provokingly] what happened to your cheek, dr. becker?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i was careless. happens sometimes.}
