<A>__{(dale, zarkov) it is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only on the exterior. there are some controls and displays, but in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed from conventional spacecraft as zarkov's solitary genius is from everyday science. immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity, zarkov waves the gun at flash.}

<D>__{flash! sack him!}
<A>__{zarkov wheels and pulls the door shut. flash jumps him. he punches zarkov in the gut. zarkov slams him back with the well known strength of a madman. flash clobbers him again. falling, zarkov dives sidewards and hits a switch. the capsule whines softly and begins to whirl. looking out through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. what's left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those laser bolts, flashing fire that makes us dizzy. flash staggers to his feet and finds dale, folds his arms around her protectively. the centrifugal force is rapidly increasing now, throws them both against the wall. faster and faster, whirling, the force presses dale's body back against flash's until they are almost one flesh. we move over and find zarkov plastered against another part of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted by the terrific g force operating here now, his lips moving as he speaks with enormous effort:}
