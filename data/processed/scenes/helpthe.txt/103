<A>__{skeeter and stuart stand beneath an old cypress tree as charlotte peeps from an upstairs window.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{look. i know it was a few weeks back, but i came here to say i'm sorry for the way i acted.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{who sent you? william or hilly?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{neither. i was rude, and i've been thinking about it a lot.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{well, i haven't. so, just go.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{now, look. i told hilly i wasn't ready to go out on any date. i wasn't even close to ready.}
<A>__{stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.}
<C>__{stuart }
<D>__{i was engaged last year. she ended it.}
<A>__{skeeter refuses to pity him.}
<C>__{stuart }
<D>__{we'd been dating since we were fifteen. you know how it is.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{actually, i don't. i've never dated anyone before.}
<A>__{stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{well! that must be it then.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i've got plenty to say...}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{would you like to...come downtown with me and have dinner? we could talk... we could listen to each other this time.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i can't think of anything worse.}
<A>__{stuart looks down and nods.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{then, i'm sorry. that's what i came to say and...i said it.}
<A>__{stuart turns and walks towards his car, self consciously weaving his strong fingers through his hair. skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out to stuart.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{just give me a minute!}
<A>__{stuart turns.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{let me get my sweater.}
