<L>__{exterior desert rock}
<A>__{gregory is fully awake, but he thinks hes dreaming. he reaches out and pokes the black clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. he looks up, but the glaring sun obscures the face.}
<D>__{gregorys voice is raspy as he starts to speak.}
<C>__{gregory}

<A>__{agent smith grins. he turns away, and the desert landscape before them turns into a soothing, cool, crystal forest lake. smith takes a step toward it, then turns and extends his hand.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{interested?}
<A>__{gregory is mystified. speechless, he drags himself to his feet, hoisting chandra, and steps toward the lake.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{this cant be real. he steps forward, only to have the image recede.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{you this, dont you?}

<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{will you help us?}
<C>__{gregory}

<A>__{cu: smith extends his hand. gregory grasps it. he lets go, and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.}
