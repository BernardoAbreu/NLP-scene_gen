<L>__{ext alley, same time}
<A>__{alex crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in front of his face. he tries to talk, or scream, but all that comes out is a wheezing sound. chev follows him out into the alley, brandishing the butcher knife, heartrate slamming.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{how you like that one, tough guy? how freaking awesome was that?}
<A>__{he kicks him in the ribs, knocking him over.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{you feel like talking to me? where’s your brother?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(anger gradually overcoming the shock)}
<D>__{doing your mother like an iraqi prisoner, you bitch.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{nice ... wonder how many steaks i could get out of you ...}
<A>__{alex rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at chev. he smashes chev into the alley wall and lands on him with his full weight. chev is pinned. alex, enraged, attempts with some success to strangle him with his remaining hand. chev struggles in futility, heart hammering. it seems hopeless ... ... until kaylo appears behind alex with a rolling pin and brings it down on his skull with a loud crack. alex rises up, staggering, and advances on kaylo, who drops the rolling pin and cowers amidst the trash cans. chev gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back of alex’s head. chev pulls the trigger twice.}
<B>__{click. click.}
<C>__{chev }
<D>__{what??}
<A>__{he tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the restaurant as alex proceeds to beat kaylo down with a trashcan, swinging it one handed. chev picks up alex’s disconnected hand, which is still clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. he uses alex’s finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him away. alex hits the ground with a thud.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{jesus ... nothing’s easy ...}
<A>__{he pries the gun from alex’s cold, dead fingers, shoves it in his pocket and tosses the hand to a disgusted kaylo, who tries to get away from it ...}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{you want to hold hands?}
<A>__{... and begins to rifle through alex’s pockets. he finds a cellphone, clicks through the menu and hits send. it rings. ricky verona answers.}
<C>__{verona }
<D>__{talk to me, bro.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(impersonating alex)}
<D>__{hey ricky, whadya think about sucking me off, ya in the mood? maybe let me lick your ass or sumtink?}
