<L>__{interior living room moments later}
<A>__{erica and harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows. lightning crackles across the sky and the}
<B>__{lights in the house go out. a match is struck}
<A>__{and a candle is lit. then another one, and another one. erica turns and finds harry just looking at her. before either of them has time to think, they kiss.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(truly confused)}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{erica}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{try not to keep score.}
<A>__{he kisses her again and again.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{soft lips...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm so glad they still work.}
<A>__{i haven't used them for kissing in so long. they've been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and... he kisses her quiet. relieved, she finally fully kisses him back. a big gorgeo s kiss.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, well, now look who's got}
<A>__{something that works... they both look down at harry. hello, mr. midnight.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{and you didn't even take via }

<D>__{kiss me before you make it go away.}
<A>__{she kisses him long and sweet. erica's bed they're kissing on it. the rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this could be world class interesting.}
<P>__{(erica nods)}
<D>__{having any doubts?}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(as they kiss)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{but so far the kissing is spectacular.}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}
<D>__{i'm not grading you, just mentioning it. brilliant.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way. he pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can't get past your damn turtleneck. . .}
<A>__{he tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet. he comes back up when erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a scissors and hands it to him.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{cut it off... please.}
<A>__{what a brilliant invitation. he takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts. the turtleneck falls open from the center. when he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is. he takes her in.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're beautiful.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{open your eyes so i know you can hear me.}
<P>__{(she opens her eyes)}
<D>__{beautiful...}
<A>__{they kiss and she reaches down for his pants.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what about birth control?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{menopause.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{who's the lucky boy...}
<A>__{he kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and out of frame. erica can't quite believe life held this twist for her. then:,}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i think we should take your blood pressure.}
<A>__{his head pops back into frame. what?????}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's irresponsible not to.}
<A>__{harry ' a minute later sprawled out on the bed. erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. like a warm jewish mother of a dominatrix. he looks up at her, shaking his head...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nobody but you would. . .}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah...so you're lucky.}
<A>__{erica grabs harry's glasses, reads the results.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(ecstatic)}
<D>__{one twenty over eighty!!! baby!}
<A>__{the blood pressure cuff in slow motion hurdles recklessly into the air.}
