<B>__{back window motor home}
<A>__{we see through the back window of the motor home, the border getting smaller as we drive away from it. scott knocks on the bathroom door.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{it's clear.}
<A>__{seth bursts out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{goddamn, that was. intense!}
<A>__{seth goes to the back window. he sees the border getting farther and farther away. no cars following.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{we did it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we're in mexico.}
<A>__{seth throws his head back and screams for joy. kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to seth's scream, along with scott. seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of the van. everybody else is still tense as shit. but seth lets go of all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. he turns to kate.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(loud and happy)}
<D>__{come here, kate!}
<A>__{kate, nervous, takes a step back. he charges for her. grabs her, hugs her around her waist, and spins her around. when he lets her go, she stumbles dizzily onto the bed.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{you were magnificent! you told him to shut the fucking door. i'm hiding in the shower, and i'm thinking to myself, "did i just fuckin' hear what i just fuckin' heard? and what does he do he shuts the fucking door!}
<A>__{kate kind of half smiles.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{if i was a bit younger, baby, i'd fuckin' marry you!}
<A>__{seth goes up front and slaps jacob on the back.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i gotta hand it to ya, pops, you raised a fuckin' woman.}
<A>__{jacob doesn't share seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we did our part, we gotcha in mexico. now it's time for your part, letting us go.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(suddenly brightens)}
<D>__{you're gonna let us go?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{in the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are g o n e and you are f r e e. now, i know i put you guys through hell, and i know i've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. scotty, help me pick richie up, and lay him down. jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "digayo." when you get to digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "the titty twister." from what i hear, you can't miss it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{then?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.}
<A>__{he slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend to richard.}
