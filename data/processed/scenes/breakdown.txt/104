<D>__{marie, this is roger calhoun down at the bank. is the sheriff there?}

<D>__{well, maybe it's nothing, but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange...}

<L>__{exterior highway outskirts of town day}
<A>__{jeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope. various cars pass in either direction, but none slow down. jeff stiffens as an 18 wheeler approaches. but the truck thunders past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his face. jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his shoulder every few moments. his eyes narrow. the dodge ram pickup is cruising toward him. it slows, then brakes to a halt. the passenger door opens. earl sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{toss the envelope on the seat.}
<A>__{jeff stands firm.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no. first you tell me where she is.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{wrong, asshole. first you give me the money, then you find out. unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway.}
<A>__{jeff looks around, wonders if earl would risk shooting him in view of passing traffic. jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the seat. earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several packets of currency. they are wrapped with paper bands and appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. he replaces them and gestures at jeff with the gun.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around.}
<A>__{jeff complies. earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun. he beckons jeff toward the truck with the automatic.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck.}
<A>__{jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side door. earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them with several layers of duct tape.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. do it now!}
<A>__{jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed against the seat. earl reaches over and pulls the door shut. he throws the truck in gear and starts driving. jeff grimaces, looking up at him.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i gave you the money. now let her go.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{'let her go.' do i look like i have her?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what the hell }
<A>__{earl backhands jeff against the passenger door. there is a ringing sound and earl pulls a cell phone from his pocket. he presses a button and raises it to his face.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{it's done. i'm heading in.}
<P>__{(a beat; listening)}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<A>__{he ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. you think we picked you out of the blue? new car, massachusetts plates probably be days before anyone misses you. hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'rich assholes looking for trouble!'}
<A>__{he tucks the pistol in his belt. jeff looks at him, seething. jeff tries to squirm free. earl sees it and belts him across the temple. jeff slams into the passenger door, wincing.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up.}
<P>__{(mimicking panicked driver)}
<D>__{help, help, i ain't got no power!}
<A>__{earl laughs. jeff has come to rest with his back against the door. by contorting his arms, he is able to draw the letter opener from his pocket. he manipulates the letter opener into position and begins cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists. steering with one hand, earl reaches into the envelope, pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in jeff's face. jeff saws faster at the duct tape.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you know what i'm gonna do first with your money, boy? well, do you?}
<A>__{jeff glares at him.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(fluttering bills under his nose)}
<D>__{i will give you a hinterior only one thing smells better than money. you wanta guess what?}
<A>__{earl laughs obscenely. he riffles the bills under his nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning. he looks down at the bills.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{earl stares at the bills. jeff works feverishly behind his back. earl pulls out another packet, then another, examining the bills.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{these are... it's nothing but singles...}
<P>__{(erupting)}
<D>__{you lyin' sonofabitch!}
<A>__{there is a ripping sound. jeff wrests his hands free and lunges across the cab. he plants the letter opener in earl's shoulder!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{aaagghh!}
