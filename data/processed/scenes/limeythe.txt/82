<L>__{interior wilson's car.}
<A>__{despite the fact that ed is still in the driver's seat (and managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) wilson acts like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car into reverse, virtually sitting on ed as he pounds his own foot onto the gas pedal and with his ferocious eyes monitoring the door mirror, steamrolls the car backwards towards avery.}
<L>__{exterior road.}
<A>__{wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank: smashing into avery's car. pushing it right off the edge of the road.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the way.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{jumps out of his car. gun drawn. advancing on avery with it pointed. avery's car crashing through underbrush down the steep bank of the hillside. wilson's face sound of the divebombing car over. another pointed echo of his daughter's fate.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{their eyes meet momentarily. and before wilson can shoot, avery rolls over the edge of the road himself.}
<B>__{ed}
<A>__{calls frantically to wilson from their car.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{c'mon, man! c'mon!}
<A>__{sirens in the distance.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{that consuming rage overtaken him again for a second. but the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{turns on a dime, goes back to the car. before he's halfway in, ed's driving them away again. trunk at the back banging up and down, up and down.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{pulls himself back up to the road. brushing himself off. looking the way they went. he gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where maybe he'll retrieve it later.}
