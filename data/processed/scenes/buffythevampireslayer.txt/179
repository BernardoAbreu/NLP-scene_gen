<L>__{exterior outside the gym night}
<A>__{we see the doorway to the gym. a mist has risen around the entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand clustered about it. some have keen and eager expressions, some vacant, half conscious with bloodlust. they wait. a figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out. buffy. her torn dress now comes to just above her knees. she wears pike's leather jacket over it. she wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket. in one hand she holds his crossbow; in her other hand is a cross. as she steps further away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around her. the door shuts behind her.}
