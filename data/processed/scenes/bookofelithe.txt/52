<L>__{exterior wasteland gas station continuous}
<A>__{she runs out across the forecourt, onto the road. a female figure is hunched by the side of the road about fifty yards up ahead. hard to see what she's doing from here.}
<C>__{slumped female}
<D>__{hello? is anybody there?}
<A>__{solara starts walking toward her. the woman has her back to solara. she's on her knees, muttering to herself. gathering objects up from the road. as solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling with an upturned shopping cart. stuck in a roadside ditch, its contents spilled out next to a few bracken bushes. we see her face now. it's the same young woman from before. the same shopping cart. the same trap.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{the woman looks around, sees solara standing nearby. she's shocked to see that it's a girl.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh. yes, i'm fine. thank you. you go along, i will be okay.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you look like you need some help.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{no, really! i'm fine. really... i need a man to help. not you. you just keep along. please.}
<A>__{the woman seems anxious to get rid of her. tries to indicate the threat silently with her eyes, but solara doesn't get it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it'll just take a minute.}
<A>__{she steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{really, it's fine! please!}
<A>__{too late. three road brigands pounce from the bushes. every bit as brutish and horrifying as the group that eli killed on the road in our opening. they grab solara and drag her from the road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{let her go! she ain't got nothing!}
<A>__{the brigand leader looks solara up and down lustfully.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{i ain't too sure about that.}
<A>__{solara is reviled by the man. he's filthy, his stench overpowering. one eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. he licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{this wasn't the deal!}
<A>__{the brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{shut your mouth, bitch. you oughta be grateful you're getting a break.}
<A>__{he releases her. she slumps to the dirt, whimpering.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{never did care much for that dried up old snatch anyhow.}
<A>__{he looks back to the struggling solara.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{this one, though... this one looks fresh. you a virgin?}
<A>__{she says nothing, just sobs helplessly.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{well, let's find out.}
<A>__{he unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles. we hear a sound. it's hard to place. something like a thhup. the brigand leader is frozen in shock. his face goes pale, the blood draining from it. the two bandits holding solara look at their leader in dismay. staring down at his crotch. a quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down. there is an arrow imbedded in his crotch. what was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. more blood streams down his thighs. a real horror show. he staggers backward, shrieking. hands shaking. staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends. the two other brigands release solara and whip around, scanning the horizon. they see nothing. one of them has a rifle. he unslings it and aims it frantically around. then they both see it. coming right at them. the most terrifying thing either has ever seen. eli, walking toward them from the road, out of the sun. his silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. an avenging angel. he pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger. eli shoots. the arrow sails through the air and right into the rifle barrel. the feathers at the end of the shaft plugging the muzzle tight. rifle bandit pulls the trigger. the gun explodes, blowing his hands clean off. he falls to the ground, screaming. eli only had two arrows. he shoulders the bow and draws his sword. all the remaining brigand has is a small knife. the two now square off at arm's length. a hopeless mismatch. beat. the knife brigand hesitates, trembling. and then rushes eli with the knife. eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the sword. so quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all. the knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. his hand goes limp and drops the knife. and then his head falls backward like a pez dispenser. almost completely decapitated, but not quite. blood fountains from the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt. eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded on the ground, but still breathing. he stands over their fallen bodies. they stare back up at him, helpless. he crouches down between them in the dust.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. will you say with me the act of contrition?}
<A>__{the brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.}
<C>__{brigand leader}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{eli sighs. stands and looks down on him without pity.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. let you die slow in the sun. but i know better. i know where you're going. and the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you.}
<A>__{he plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him off. pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean. he turns to the other man, raising his sword.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{i want to say it. i want to be forgiven.}
<A>__{eli crouches once more by his side.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{repeat after me. oh god, i am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and i detest all my sins.}
<A>__{the bandit follows along with eli, mouthing the words quietly. the life ebbing from him with each moment.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, and do penance, and to amend my life. amen.}
<C>__{rifle bandit}
<D>__{amen...}
<A>__{his eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. dead. eli signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away. solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. eli approaches and gathers her up in his arms. she clings on to him tightly.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you came back for me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what are friends for?}
<A>__{she laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. grips him tighter. he helps her up and escorts her back to the road.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{this is the deal. you keep up. you pull your weight. you fall behind, i can't help you. okay?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there's nothing can be done for her.}
<A>__{they walk on down the road.}
