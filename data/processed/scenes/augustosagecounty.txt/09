<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{mom...?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{mom? steps into the open door of her father's study. his vacant desk chair, untouched papers, dust mots settling in the sunlight. she takes a moment, then heads upstairs. carrying us with her. finds violet, in her bedroom, sitting in front of her vanity in near darkness, smoking and on the phone.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{...you've been out there...? barely acknowledges ivy's arrival. the room is unruly. bed unmade. clothes draped over chairs. dresser and night stands cluttered with pills, tissue boxes, creams and lotions.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{...you're going out yourself...? ivy wanders into the bath. more pills, wet towels on the floor. she turns off the dripping faucet. picks up towels.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{stop that... violet is off the phone, standing in hall, watching ivy. ivy stops, briefly chastened. violet opens a bottle of pills.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{you call barb? what'd she say?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{she's on her way.}

<D>__{you're the prettiest of my three girls, but you always look like a schlub. why don't you wear makeup?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{do i need makeup?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{all women need makeup. don't let anybody tell you different. the only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was elizabeth taylor and she wore a ton. stand up straight.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{mom.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{your shoulders are slumped and your hair's all straight and you don't wear makeup. you look like a lesbian. violet takes another pill.}
<C>__{violet }

<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i'm not looking for a man.}
<C>__{violet}
