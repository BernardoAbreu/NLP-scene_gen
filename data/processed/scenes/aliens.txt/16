<L>__{interior main concourse near control block}
<A>__{a central space, laid out like a scaled down shopping mall with no styling flourishes. we see a cross section of the types of people who have come to live on godforsaken acheron. tough. pragmatic. "grapes of wrath" faces. calloused hands. not too many interior decorators. some children race in the corridor on things that look suspiciously like "big wheels."}
<L>__{interior operations room control block}
<A>__{jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays... most of the business of running the colony flows through here. it's high tech but used and scrungy. papers piled up. coffee cup rings. dolly ahead of lydecker, the assistant operations manager, as he catches up to the harried operating manager,}

<D>__{you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the ilium range, a couple days ago?}
<C>__{simpson}
<D>__{yeah. what?}
<C>__{lydecker}
<D>__{there's a guy on the horn, mom and pop survey team. says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.}
<C>__{simpson}
<D>__{christ. some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look. they don't say why, and i don't ask. i don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'}
<C>__{lydecker}
<D>__{so what do i tell this guy?}
<C>__{simpson}
<D>__{tell him, as far as i'm concerned, he finds something it's his.}
