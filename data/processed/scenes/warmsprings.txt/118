<L>__{interior dining room evening}
<A>__{the camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces, legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs. jake and a new physical therapist, mary beth, are particularly cozy.}
<C>__{franklin }
<D>__{this is a very special night we're celebrating. at last we are together eating in this dining room!}
<A>__{the hands come up and out from under the table, applauding.}
<B>__{on franklin}
<A>__{he is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{now please join me in welcoming miss jackie mills, a new arrival along with her father, samuel, all the way from oakland, california.}
<A>__{close up on jackie eight years old with black hair. her legs are in braces and she grips her father's hand tightly.}
<B>__{on franklin}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able bodied guests, mr. louis howe and my better half, mrs. franklin roosevelt.}
<B>__{on eleanor and louis}
<A>__{waving politely from their seats.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{now for the musical portion of our program...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{wait a minute! i can't let this opportunity pass without saying out loud what a lot of us feel in our hearts right now.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you're a man among men, franklin.}
<C>__{a woman's voice}
<D>__{and women!}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{and children!}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{it's a real democracy at warm springs everybody gets heard!}
<P>__{(to franklin)}
<D>__{you listening?}
<A>__{eleanor, seated next to franklin, watches as franklin, in a rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{all right then, if i may do the honors of presenting to you the lovely miss eloise hutchison of cottage c.}
<A>__{eloise wheels herself out. in a sweet, but untrained voice, she begins the introduction to her song:}
<C>__{eloise}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me. you'd be the idol of france with me. and yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically, while i sit here so ecstatically. you just look and say emphatically: not this season! there's a reason!"}
<A>__{some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's coming. various staff step out from the kitchen to watch. eloise is joined by three others all of them in wheelchairs.}
<D>__{eloise & chorus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"i won't dance! don't ask me! i won't dance! don't ask me; i won't dance, monsieur, with you."}
<A>__{simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs, has the audience cheering.}
<D>__{eloise & chorus "my heart won't let my feet do things they should do."}
<C>__{chorus}
<D>__{"you know what? you're lovely."}
<C>__{eloise}
<D>__{"and so what? i'm lovely."}
<C>__{chorus}
<D>__{"but oh! what you do to me! i'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore; i feel so absolutely stumped on the floor!"}
<A>__{this is too much for the crowd, including franklin, eleanor and louis. they laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight of eloise and her chorus. the song finished, franklin quiets down the crowd.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{before we say good night, i understand our royal taskmaster in residence, miss mahoney, insists on having the last word.}
<A>__{helena rises from her seat.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't think words describe adequately what daisy and i would like to show all of you.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{are you ready, daisy?}
<A>__{daisy's mother, cecile, carries daisy to the center of the room where helena meets them. helena bends down and removes daisy's braces. the room is hushed. daisy then begins to walk tentatively towards her mother.}
<B>__{on franklin}
<A>__{overwhelmed by what is taking place. he looks around and takes in the sight of so many different faces... some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of their own private battles.}
<B>__{on daisy}
<A>__{only a step or two away from her mother she falls the short distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms. wild cheers go up in the room while daisy's face glows with pride. she connects with franklin, who matches her smile with his own genuine and beatific.}
