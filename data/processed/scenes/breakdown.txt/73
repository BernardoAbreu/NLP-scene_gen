<L>__{interior belle's diner day}
<A>__{jeff enters, looks around. it's the same scene as before: same bartender, a slightly different cast of characters. no sign of amy. jeff advances to the bartender, who stands at a sink rinsing beer mugs.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{did she come in?}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(looks up, uninterested)}
<D>__{didn't see her.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you didn't see her, or she didn't come in?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{buddy, i told you the last time. i'm busy. maybe she came in, maybe she didn't. all i know is, i didn't see her.}
<A>__{jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the bartender's skills of observation. he grinds his jaw. the other customers at the bar have been watching all this. one of them, an older grizzled barfly, looks up at jeff.}
<C>__{barfly}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{none of my business, mister. but if i was you i'd take a look in the ladies room.}
<A>__{the barfly gives jeff a wink and turns back to his beer. snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes when jeff glances at them. jeff knows this is almost certainly a put on, but he can't take a chance. while the barflies watch, poker faced, jeff walks to the door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. his knock is answered by a wordless sound, half groan, half }
<B>__{gasp.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{amy?}
<A>__{silence. jeff tries the door. it's locked. he rattles it. another groan. jeff puts his shoulder against the door, heaves inward. the door swings open, revealing }

<A>__{flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. she whirls around, a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{hey what the hell you doing?!}
<A>__{jeff backs away, yanks the door shut. the barflies chuckle among themselves. jeff strides angrily for the exit. he stops at the door, takes one last look around. no one seems to be paying him much attention. he turns to leave... ... but something stops him. he can't put his finger on it. there's something wrong here... he stares at the other customers. why do they avoid eye contact? are they hiding something? he scrutinizes more closely... there is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table shoveling food in his mouth. he's been averting his gaze ever since jeff walked in. and then there's the traveling salesman. overweight, sweaty. popping vitamins along with his coffee. or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book at the bar? probably an ex con. while jeff is running these suspicions through his mind, a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. the bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the carbon slip. he places one copy above the grill and another in a pile by the cash register. jeff stares, an idea forming... he approaches the bar.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i want to see your order slips.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you write down the names. i want to see them.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what are you, nuts? i don't have to show you jack shit.}
<A>__{jeff leans in his face.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{if my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile.}
<A>__{the bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you calling me a liar?}
<A>__{a tense beat. possessed by a sudden impulse, jeff makes a grab for the receipts. before he can reach them, the bartender's hand clamps onto his.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{mister, i've had just about enough of you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{let me see the fucking slips.}
<A>__{in one swift motion, jeff overpowers the man and extracts the receipts. he starts going through them, fast, looking at names. tully, mark, flo, andy and... jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a smith & wesson revolver.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{now, mister, you're going to have to leave.}
<A>__{jeff takes a step back. everyone in the diner is staring. he stumbles backwards, heads for the exit.}
