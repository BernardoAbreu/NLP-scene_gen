<D>__{sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. when elektra's ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.}
<P>__{(measured)}
<D>__{i advised against paying the ransom. i knew it was renard. i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{how many deaths is he responsible for? how many innocent people? you may only get one shot at a man like renard. same circumstances, i'd do the same again.}
<A>__{she turns to the hologram.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{we sent 009 down to kill him. before he could, elektra escaped. a week later our man caught up with the target. put a bullet in his head.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that bullet is still there.}
<A>__{bond moves toward the ghostly renard. we now see the bullet}
<B>__{inside his skull.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{he survived?}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{the doctor who saved him couldn't get it out, so renard killed him. when interpol found the x rays, there was mild jubilation. effectively, he's a dead man.}
<A>__{she presses a button, the hologram turns...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. he feels no pain. he can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{'that which does not kill me makes me stronger.'}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{now robert is dead. he got his revenge.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{he's not through yet. renard doesn't blow up five million dollars unless he knows there's more coming in. he's working for someone. someone who wants to stop the pipeline. and they hired the perfect killer. one with a vendetta against king...and you.}
<A>__{moneypenny enters with a file, which she hands to m. m looks over the file: his medical report.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{i see the good doctor gave you glowing testimonials. 'exceptional stamina'...}
<C>__{moneypenny}
<D>__{he's always been good at oral exams.}
<A>__{moneypenny disappears out the door. m is all business.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{get out to the pipeline. find the insider who switched the pin. if your instincts are right, renard will be back. he hasn't completed the job. the pipeline is still going forward, and we have elektra to thank for that.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{the worm on the hook again.}
<A>__{they exchange a look. a look of recognition between two professionals, who know the terrible price of what they do.}
