<L>__{ext down house. lounge. the present. night}
<A>__{torrential rain crashes down on the house, the garden, the ancient trees and the outbuildings, flooding the path and the lane beyond the gate. darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside}
<L>__{interior down house. lounge room.}
<A>__{emma is playing a beautiful slow nocturne. the rain outside drown out all other side. she doesn't notice the figure of darwin until he appears, like a ghost, reflected in the polished wood of the piano. she turns with a start and sees him, still in his dripping coat, hair plastered over his brow}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{sorry. i startled you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{take your coat off by the fire there. what time is it?}
<A>__{darwin stays where he is, dripping on the carpet}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{we need to talk. i need to talk to you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{of course, but dry your hair. i shall call for a towel.}
<A>__{as she moves to the bell pull he grabs her wrist}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i went back to worcester road. i saw annie.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{charles. no.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{let me tell you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i don't want to hear it. this must stop.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you don't understand.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i do! do you think me deaf and blind. you have lived with her and spoken with her every day since she died.}
<A>__{parslow comes in with firewood then sees emma yelling at darwin and hurriedly retreats, spilling logs in the hallway.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{she is more real to you than i am. she's dead charles.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{then what is wrong with you that even our poor daughter cannot be left in her grave but you would....}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i know she is dead. i know it. it is you who will not accept the fact, preferring to think of her in heaven.}
<A>__{this again! the unspoken argument which has been brewing for a decade, never before expressed so bluntly. emma heads for the door}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<A>__{she heads into the hallway, he follows her ranting}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{snowy white wings and dancing with the angels. is that your idea of honesty.}
<A>__{servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{why did you come back. i will not hear this!}
<A>__{emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs. darwin pursues her. on the landing, betty and horace, wide eyed and terrified are bundled into the nursery by brodie as charles thunders up the stair.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you have to emma, everything these was between us is gone. the boat is wrecked and sunk now. we have to hold to something else.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{to what. your ghosts? your theories? what charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{to the truth of what we know it.}
<A>__{she slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{open this door emma. the truth, how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was....}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(through the door)}
<D>__{i know that. i do not need you to say it. of course i know.}
<A>__{charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through it. emma screams}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{but free of the fantasy, free of the rest, the silly vain hope that we will be reunited in heaven and the nagging unspoken belief that i killed her!}
<A>__{in the lower hallway all the servants hear this in the nursery, brodie, aghast, covers the childrens ears in the bedroom, emma has nowhere left to run}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i have never said that}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{say it now. say it. and all the rest that follows. that i should have kept annie warm that day on the beach. i should not have taken her to malvern. i should have let you come.}
<A>__{tears spring to her eyes and to his. the fury has gone from both of them, leaving sadness and pity}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i should have insisted.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{no. it was me. i took her from you it was my fault.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i could have followed. i was her mother what was i thinking of.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{we thought she would live. you were not to know.}
<A>__{he moves to her, she startles, then lets him enfold her in his damp coat}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i did. i did know. i knew when you left that i would never see her again. i hated you for taking her.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i hated myself. i knew that none of them could save her.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{all i could do was watch hopelessly and weep for her then flee the place in terror, not even waiting to see our poor dear daughter buried. she was our treasure and i failed her. we both did. we should never have married each other.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{the unspeakable . i am saying that you and i, in making our perfect child, endowed her with the very weakness which killed her. emma. that is what i couldn't write. that is what forestalled me all these years. it wasn't you i was angry with, it wasn't innes and it wasn't god. i was angry with my theory. it was the truth i was angry with. it is the truth.}
<A>__{weeping, she shakes her head in furious denial. he kisses her hair, her eyes, her tear streaked cheeks...}
