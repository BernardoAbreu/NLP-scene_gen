<D>__{i don't know...}
<A>__{finnegan looks around to the engine room, a labyrinth of pipe lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel. the lighting is very poor, very dark. he takes off.}

<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{takes one to know one.}
<A>__{snap!! a tentacle shoots out between finnegan and trillian. just missing them as it slams into a wall. finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed. trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt. finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks the tentacle slowly squirms across the wall like a big leach. trying to find its prey. finnegan is frozen in place. watching. trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees hideous little worm like feelers and suckers protrude up and down the tentacle. wriggling and writhing and feeling their way across the wall. getting closer and closer to finnegan. finnegan's eyes go to his pulse rifle close to trillian's feet. he motions for her to push it toward him. but, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her. tongue like, the feelers lick their way across the oily wall. finnegan ducks as they squirm over his head. then he brushes against some dirt, making a scraping sound. a feeler quickly drops down and touches finnegan's arm. he leaps to his feet. so does trillian. she grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley. finnegan tries to run, but the feelers hold him tight. two more feelers slap onto his arm. he yells. the creature starts reeling him in. angle on: trillian, running. finnegan's yell reaches her. she stops cold. looking back the way she came, torn. angle on: finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle. when...out of the darkness, trillian suddenly comes running back. panting hard, she aims the gun.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{shoot it! shoot it!}
<A>__{spurred to action, trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger. nothing happens.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{the safety! the safety!}
<A>__{trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to find it.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{i don't know where it is!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{on the side!!}
<A>__{desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. smacks the tentacle. hard. ripping into its flesh. it squirts ink blood, releases finnegan and recoils. finnegan drops to his knees. grabbing his arm, in pain. the tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again. trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward. the tentacle coils, ready to strike. just before it does so, finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{let's get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{finnegan staggers to his feet. he and trillian run off.}
