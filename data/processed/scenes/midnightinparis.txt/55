<A>__{only gil and hemingway.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{the assignment was to take the hill. there were four of us.}
<C>__{hemingway }
<D>__{five if you counted vincente but he had lost his hand when a grenade went off and he couldn't fight as he could when i first met him and he was young and brave and the hill was soggy from days of rain and sloped down toward a road and there were many german soldiers on the road and the idea was to aim at the first group and if our aim was true we could delay them.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{weren't you scared?}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{getting killed.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{you'll never write well if you fear dying. do you?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{it's my biggest fear.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{but it's something all men before you have done and all men will do.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{yes but }
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{have you ever made love to a truly great woman?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{my fiance is very sexy.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{and when you make love to her you feel true and beautiful passion and you at least for that moment lose your fear of death.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i don't know about that }
<A>__{canto: (2)}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{i believe that love that's true and real creates a respite from death. all cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters i know or belmonte who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again. think about it.}
