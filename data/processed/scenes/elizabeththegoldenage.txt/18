<L>__{interior armourer's shop, london day}
<A>__{a pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a hazelnut.}
<C>__{armourer }
<D>__{so what's it for, my young friend? not for shooting rabbits, i'm guessing.}
<C>__{savage}
<D>__{we live in dangerous times.}
<C>__{armourer}
<D>__{we do indeed.}
<A>__{savage moves close as if to study the loading process. we see the two of them talking from outside the window.}
<C>__{savage}
<P>__{(very low)}
<D>__{the conspiracy gains strength. tell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court.}
<A>__{the armourer nods. he hands the pistol to savage. savage takes it and leaves. immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now seated armourer. the armourer turns round.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{i ask for your forgiveness.}
<A>__{moving with speed, he seizes the armourer's head, twists it to one side, and snaps his neck. reston walks quietly out of the store.}
