<A>__{she flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead.}
<L>__{exterior world's fair night}
<A>__{the saucer crashes through the unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and thuds to the earth, crashing through brush, dirt and rock... jay and kay come to their feet... in front of them, the dust clears... trees uprooted, stones and dirt thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left... and the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off kilter in a mound of debris... a hatch comes up...revealing edgar, walking slowly toward them, with contained fury.}

<D>__{you don't get it. i've won. it's over.}

<D>__{you are under arrest for violating number 4 1 53 of the tycho accord. please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying.}

<D>__{you milk suckers! you don't matter! in a few seconds you won't even be matter!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head.}
<A>__{he pumps the gun for emphasis.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{put my hands on my head?}
<A>__{edgar stares at him. then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. his giant pincers rip free of the rotting skin. he extends both pincers to the sides, and, my god, his reach must be twelve feet across. now the skin and clothes on edgar's legs begins to crack and shred. they burst apart, revealing two hideous, doubled over insect legs. the bug raises himself aloft on his legs. he sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. the torso explodes in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally edgar's head simply bursts apart, spattering against the walls. edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug like exoskeleton, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse like feet with three toes each. he raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. the galaxy hangs on a chain around his neck.}
<C>__{bug}
<D>__{like this?}
<A>__{kay and jay pump their guns and aim at the bug. suddenly the bug spits. and a huge, slimy wad of goo shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns. the bug snorts it back, tearing them from jay and kay's grasp, then swallowing them. jay and kay have only a second to react before the bug swipes at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat and sends them flying fifteen feet in the air.}
