<C>__{roach}
<D>__{sorry, bro, reflexes. how did you do that?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{black magic.}
<A>__{day day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth.}
<D>__{day day give me dat. i'm the one with the problem.}
<A>__{roach pulls out a mini skateboard that's actually a lighter.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{weed doesn't solve problems. it eases the mind, and the soul. enjoy.}
<A>__{he lights the jointerior day day takes a hit.}
<C>__{craig}

<P>__{(hitting it good)}
<D>__{sorry, dude.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you better open up a window or something before the smell gets out. day day ain't no windows in here.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{i got an idea.}
<A>__{he hands the joint to craig. gets up and closes the door. then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner.}
<C>__{roach }
<D>__{this is a little theory of mine... it should work.}
<A>__{he plugs in the vacuum and turns it on. he puts the nozzle in day day's face.}
<D>__{day day blow.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{that ain't gonna work.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{fuck yeah.}
<A>__{day day hits the 'j and blows into the nozzle. it quickly sucks up the smoke.}
<D>__{day day}
<P>__{(passing the 'j)}
<D>__{it works.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{still gonna smell it.}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{no way. watch this.}
<A>__{roach hits the joint harder than anyone else. smoke starts to come out of his ears. craig and day day get a kick out of that.}
