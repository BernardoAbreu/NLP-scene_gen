<A>__{barris and penny sit in a booth. penny has black coffee in front of her. she is pale and drawn.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{why were you with that girl in our living room?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{it's not our living room, pen.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{that's your defense? you know what it feels like to see you with someone else? in any living room.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{you know who i am, penny. i don't force you to hang around.}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you don't force me? fuck. so you're saying you have no interest in this, one way or the other?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{no, i'm not saying that.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{well, then, what are you saying, chuck? do you want me around or not? do you even like me?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{of course i like you.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i need to know how much you like me.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't even know what that means, "how much?" how can i rate a person in that way? that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you could if you felt it. if you felt it, it would be easy to rate me. you could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say, "this much, penny."}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{everything's complicated, pen. nothing's black and white like that.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{do you want me around or not? if you don't, just say so, so i know. okay?}
<A>__{barris and penny look at each other. she starts to cry.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i love you, pen, in my way. maybe not in that crazy, head over heels thing, but what is that, anyway? romantic love. isn't that just an illusion?}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you just said you love me, right?}
