<L>__{interior harland's house basement day}
<A>__{the vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along the concrete slab under the window. robots are spraying a red mist out of the back of their ships. ray holds his hand in the mist that is entering the window. after a moment.... ray retracts his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{ray!!! ray!!!! ray!!!! ray!!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{keep your voice down!!! quiet!!!}
<A>__{harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of blood. they both turn back around then harland runs. ray watches a man being set down, fighting to be let go. a needle like object comes down and stabs the man. it then pumps the blood out of him. ray has a horrified look on his face.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(repeats for about 2 minutes) not my}
<D>__{blood!!!}
<A>__{ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling. then... the robots stop because they hear him. ray runs to harland who is digging some sort of hole.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stop it! stop it! you gotta stop it! you gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(with an insane expression and tone)}
<D>__{they drink us!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{please, they'll hear you!}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{then they spray us, like a fertilizer!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you gotta be quiet!}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{drink us and....}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{they're gonna come back down here!}
<A>__{harland has mentally lost it now.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{then they spit us out all over their goddamn red weeds!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(no longer whispering) do you understand}
<D>__{what i'm gonna have to do? i can't let my daughter die because of you.}
<A>__{harland pays no attention to him.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{this tunnel will get us to the city. we'll have our own tunnels there. ready made! subway, see what i'm saying!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{you can hide a whole army down there!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stop it!!}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{... we'll go underground!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stop it!!!}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{sneak attacks at night!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you stop it!!!}
<A>__{ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead with a shovel. ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile next to harland.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{we're the resistance ray! they can't occupy this country! occupations always fail! history's taught us that a thousand times. this is our land.}
<A>__{ray runs up the stairs of the room to rachel standing calmly in the middle of the basement.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(continues) ... we eat it, we breathe}
<D>__{it, only we can live on it! they can't survive here ray. they weren't built for it.}
<A>__{ray hugs rachel because he knows what he has to do. harland goes on saying odd things as ray gets rachel prepared for what he has to do. ray puts a black cloth over rachel's eyes which makes her breathing go erratic.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{whatever you hear... don't take this off.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad??}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rach?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what was that song... that lullaby i didn't know?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hushabye mountains}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah. please, rach, sing it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(begins to sing) ... a gentle breeze....}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't stop.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... on hushabye mountain...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... for far away my baby goes...}
<A>__{ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. then walks back to harland. he is still digging and chanting "not my blood"}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... it fills the sails ...}
<A>__{harland stops and sees ray standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... of boats that are waiting ...}
<A>__{ray closes the door behind him as he steps in.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... waiting to sail your worries away ...}
<A>__{rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the door.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... so close your eyes. you're on hushabye mountain ...}
<A>__{rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{... wave goodbye to the cares of the day and watch your boat, from hushabye mountain, sail far away from lullaby bay.}
<A>__{all is silent for a while. ray opens the door and walks out. rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. ray is sitting on the stairs. rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. they both sit there in silence.}
