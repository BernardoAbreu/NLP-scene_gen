<L>__{interior jacob's apt. night}
<A>__{jacob is lying in bed in his own bedroom with a thermometer in his mouth. jezzie is pacing the floor with great agitation.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i've never been so mortified in my whole life. never! screaming like that. i don't understand what's gotten into you, jake, to make you do a thing like that. you're not acting normal. i've lived with too many crazies in my life. i don't want it anymore. i can't handle it. i'm tired of men flipping out on me. shit, you'd think it was my fault. well you picked me, remember that. i don't need this.}
<A>__{the neighbor pounds on the wall.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all right! all right!}
<A>__{jezzie jabs her finger at the wall.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{if you go crazy on me you're goin' crazy by yourself. you understand?}
<A>__{jezzie reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. she looks at it closely and then squints to see it better.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's it say? a hundred and two?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i don't believe this. i'm calling the doctor.}
<A>__{she runs out of the room. jacob calls after her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{jezzie }
<D>__{it's gone to the top.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how high is that?}
<C>__{jezzie }
<D>__{the numbers stop at 107.}
<A>__{jezzie is on the phone to the doctor in the next room. jacob begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the foot of the bed. he pulls it up around his shoulders. the whole bed vibrates with his shivering. suddenly jezzie rushes through the bedroom and into the bathroom. she turns on the bath water.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what the hell are you doin'?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{get your clothes off.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i'm freezing.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{get your clothes off!}
<A>__{jacob gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the kitchen.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what'd the doctor say?}
<C>__{jezzie }
<D>__{that you'd die on the way to the hospital. now get into that tub.}
<A>__{jacob stares at her as she bursts back into the bedroom carrying four trays of ice cubes. she hurries into the bathroom and dumps them in the tub.}
<C>__{jezzie }
<D>__{he's coming right over.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{coming here?}
<C>__{jezzie }
<D>__{goddamn it. get in here. i can't stand around waiting.}
<A>__{she rushes out of the bathroom and pulls jacob out of bed. he is shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and undressing him at the same time. she maneuvers him into the bathroom next to the tub. he looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're out of your mind. i'm not getting in there. i'd rather die.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{that's your decision.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{look at me. i'm ice cold.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you're red hot, damn it. get in there. i've got to get more ice.}
<A>__{she runs out of the room. the door to the apartment slams shut. jacob sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh jesus!}
<A>__{he sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water turns his foot bright red. he keeps it in as long as he can and then yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a towel. jacob rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of its pain.}
