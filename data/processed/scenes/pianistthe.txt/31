<L>__{interior ghetto apartment evening}
<A>__{summer. the windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto can be heard in the background. the family sit round the small table as mother comes with a saucepan of soup and starts to serve.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{and, please, tonight, for once, i don't want anything bad talked about. let's enjoy our meal.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{okay, then i will tell you something funny. you know who i mean by dr. raszeja.}
<C>__{regina}
<D>__{the surgeon?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{the surgeon. well, for some reason, don't ask me why, the germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation...}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{on a jew? they allowed a pole to come in to operate on a jew?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{he got a pass, that's all i know. anyway, he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation. he'd just made the first incision when the ss burst in, shoot the patient lying on the table, and then shoot dr. raszeja and everybody else who was there. isn't that a laugh? the patient didn't feel a thing, he was anaesthetised }
<A>__{he laughs. no one else does.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{henryk, i said nothing bad.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{what's the matter with you all? have you lost your sense of humour?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{it's not funny.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{well, you know what's funny? you're funny with that ridiculous tie.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{what are you talking about, my tie? what's my tie got to do with anything? i need the tie for my work.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{boys, boys...}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i blame the americans.}
<A>__{the others look at him.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{for what? for my tie?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{american jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? what do they think they're doing? people here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany!}
<A>__{suddenly, there's a roar of engines and a screech of brakes. slamming of doors. the family rush to the windows.}
