<A>__{unable to hear the warning horn, jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling. suddenly, he hears something. a key going in the door. he bolts toward the closet. he flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens. just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off silence, except for dorothy vallens at the front door.}

<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{frank, you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{she goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail. she nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch. she puts on a record, "for your precious love." she sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the music; she starts to cry. she stops herself and takes the record off. she starts taking off her stocking. she then takes off her dress. underneath, she has on a bra and panties. she crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom. jeffrey can't see her too well now. she takes off her panties in the bathroom. she is now naked. she looks at herself in the mirror. we see jeffrey's face as he watches her. she disappears from view completely and we hear her start a shower.}
