<A>__{descending the stone stairs, alfred arrives in the batcave. "good king wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well. across a catwalk the batmobile rests on its little plateau, wrapped in a tarp. alfred clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea service down. he glances up at the bank of video monitors and sees sekowsky, still babbling, on several channels simultaneously. he scans the cave, but there's no trace of}

<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{sir? master bruce??}
<A>__{as if in response, bats screech and flutter in the distant recesses of the cavern. alfred turns suddenly and sees bruce behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, rising out of}
<B>__{a bottomless abyss.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i'm not deaf, alfred. i hear you.}
<A>__{he's wearing his civvie tweed pants and cashmere sweater but he's got the utility belt, with its spring action reel, buckled about his waist. clutching a bundle, he hangs in midair for a moment, dangling over the void. alfred slowly regains his composure:}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i took the liberty of preparing tea.}
<P>__{(indicating tbe monitors)}
<D>__{i take it you've been watching the news?}
<A>__{bruce, still dangling, glances up at the sekowsky interview and nods.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.}
<A>__{bruce rocks back and forth to build up momentum. he kicks off on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt. preoccupied, he drops his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow aluminum rods, connected by what appears to be surgical tubing.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i should inform you...christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the fireman's toy fund.}
<P>__{(eyeing the equipment)}
<D>__{if i may inquire...?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, yeah. watch this.}
<A>__{bruce hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the tubing. the tubing inflates and the rods spring erect stiffening, wing like, into something which looks remarkably like the skeleton of an umbrella.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{most ingenious, sir. what exactly <is> it?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what does it look like?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{to the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella.}
<A>__{sounds good. bruce eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{good guess, alfred. that's exactly right.}
<A>__{bruce hits the trigger, and the rods wilt with a hiss. he sits at his lab table; alfred unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{splendid, sir, and if i may say, i'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now the toy fund. our contribution last year was a half million dollars...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{we can do better than that.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{then there's the foster parents program... the gotham homeless crusade...}
<A>__{bruce nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. he seems oddly preoccupied not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. alfred looks on, concerned:}
<C>__{alfred }
<D>__{is something troubling you, sir?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yeah...the holidays, i guess. always gets me thinking about...}
<P>__{(he changes the subject)}
<D>__{and to tell you the truth, i'm a little concerned about vicki.}
<C>__{alfred}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{miss vale, sir...?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{yeah. i've been thinking about it lately. thinking about it a lot...}
<P>__{(gravely; shaking his head)}
<D>__{...and i still can't figure out what to get her for christmas.}
