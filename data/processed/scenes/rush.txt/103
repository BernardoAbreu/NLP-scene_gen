<A>__{niki's car is pursued by james's. they disappear behind a copse of trees. out of sight. when they re emerge, james is ahead of niki, having overtaken him to the delight of the partisan crowd. the chequered flag waves again as james's car roars across the finish line... caption: "race 8. hunt wins. lauda 2nd." james screams in catharsis and triumph. teeth clenched. eyes wide and staring with concentration. we notice screaming girl fans cheering him now.}
