<L>__{interior concrete tunnel}
<A>__{pitch black. trickling water. a distant voice over a p.a. system recites names, followed by numbers. a light, far away. white walks towards it. he steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a blank wall. he pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the slot, dials the number on his message. ringing no answer. suddenly white feels cold.}
<C>__{voice o.s.}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{startled, white drops the phone and turns. a figure moves forward out of darkness: angle on the mystery man from the hotel lobby. the stranger wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale skin. he is completely bald. he studies white carefully. white glances about nervously walks back up the corridor, his eyes pinned to the man.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{you are lost, yes?}
<A>__{white retreats faster. a flash of steel a dagger appears by the stranger's side, gripped in a black leather glove. he moves forward, a grin on his pale face. white stops, backs against the wall.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{co operate. do not make this difficult.}
<A>__{white panics he's cornered. he remembers the revolver. he pulls it from his coat and levels it at the stranger, his hand shakes terribly. on the stranger continuing to advance. something about his eyes makes white immobile, unable to think clearly.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{you will not shoot, yes. there is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness...}
<A>__{the gun fires again and again. red splashes appear on the man. his shoulder. his leg. his neck. he walks forward, with spastic jerks as bullets rip into him. a final shot point blank into the stranger's forehead. a stream of black liquid spouts from the hole. blue smoke clears. the man stands motionless, his mouth hangs open. then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.}
