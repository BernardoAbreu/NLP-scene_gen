<L>__{interior vito's log cabin night.}
<A>__{two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight. they click out a rhythm, and crash into a number. cut back to reveal a small, low ceilinged jointerior on stage are the steve kovack quartet, four perspiring middle aged men with day jobs. youngish couples, and the odd middle aged couple navigate the dance floor. a smattering of lost singles line the bar. the wheelers and campbells sit squashed into a booth on the side of the dance floor. several empty glasses have accumulated. milly is beating the edge of the table with red drink straws. she's a few drinks ahead. they have to shout over the music.}

<D>__{oh, sure. give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything!}
<A>__{frank turns his attention to milly. he's a good dancer. his movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on april. milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up, perspiring through her dress. he spins her around and around, back and forth into his arms. milly begins to look slightly dizzy.}
<C>__{milly }
<D>__{...frank.}
<A>__{he doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care.}
