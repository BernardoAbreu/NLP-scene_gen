<A>__{murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the chimera. greer operates the deck crane, one of dodge's mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.}
<B>__{with epps}
<A>__{epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the chimera. dodge pokes his face out from the other side.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{bring it on, dude.}
<A>__{dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable, which epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable. she places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys.}
<C>__{dodge }
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{hit it!}
<A>__{epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the chimera's hull with a shower of black rust.}
