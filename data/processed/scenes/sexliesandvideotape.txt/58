<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the previous afternoon. we are no longer looking at ann on the monitor, but watching her and graham as they made the tape. for instance, we can now see graham from ann's point of view, or the two of them at the same time, etc.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{can't.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you said you weren't always impotent.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so you have had sex.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{who was the last person you had sex with?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{her name was elizabeth.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so what happened? was it so bad that it turned you off?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no, it was wonderful. that wasn't the problem.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what was the problem?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the problem was me. i was...i was a pathological liar. or am, i should say. lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so you lied to her?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes. i did. willfully and repeatedly.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i loved her for how good she made me feel, and i hated her for how good she made me feel. and at that time, i tended to express my feelings non verbally. i couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{and now you can?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{don't you get lonely?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{how could i, with all these nice people stopping by? the fact is that i've lived by myself for so long, i can't imagine living with another person. it's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. and anyway, i'm asking the questions. are you happy?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't know anymore. i thought i was, but obviously i was wrong.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{not yet. i'm not sure i will. i just want out.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{if you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't know. it all gets back to that cynthia thing. i don't like her...eagerness. there's nothing left to imagine, there's no...}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{subtlety?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{subtlety, yes. no subtlety. plus, i've never really felt able to open up with anyone. i mean, that other person i told you about, i enjoyed making love with him a lot, but i still wasn't able to really let go. i always feel like i'm being watched and i shouldn't embarrass myself.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{and you feel the same way with john?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{kind of. i mean, john's like this kind of...craftsman. like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. but that's all he can make, and i don't need anymore tables.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{interesting analogy.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i'm babbling.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no, you're not.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{god, i m so mad at him!!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you should be. he lied to you. so did cynthia.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yeah, i know, but somehow i expect that from her, i mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, i don't know, i shouldn't stick up for her i guess, but him. he lied so...deeply!! ooo, i want to watch him die!!}
<A>__{ann sits quietly for a moment. graham watches her silently. the camera continues to roll.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(looks up at graham)}
<D>__{you're really never going to make love again?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm not planning on it.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{if you were in love with me, would you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm not in love with you.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but if you were?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i...i can't answer that precisely.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's very flattering.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so why won't you make love with me? why wouldn't you, i mean?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{ann. are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i'm asking for real. i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. will you?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i've told you.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but i don't understand }
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? i could start to }
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig }
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i couldn't face her if i had slept with somebody else.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{who? elizabeth?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you mean you're still in contact with her?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but you're planning to be?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't know. possibly.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute. what's going on here? did you come back here just to see her again?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{not entirely.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but that was part of it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{like maybe a big part?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{possibly.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{graham, i mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! don't you think she will have changed?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't know. i really would rather not talk about it.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(has to laugh)}
<D>__{whoa!! i'm so glad we got that on tape!! you won't answer a question about elizabeth, but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? are you going to tell her about them? i can't imagine her being too understanding about that. but since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{as i said, i haven't decided what to do, exactly. perhaps i won't do anything.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?}
<A>__{graham says nothing. ann looks at him.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, god, graham, this is so...pathetic. you're not even what you pretend to be, you're a lie, you're a bigger lie than you ever were.}
<A>__{graham sets the camera down, though it continues to record. he is visibly upset.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{all right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, ann. let's talk about lying to yourself. you haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. you haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{yeah, you're right. but i never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. i'm still learning, i know that. but i don't feel like i've wasted time. if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now, fine.}
<A>__{ann moves in closer, burrowing, her eyes on fire.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but you. you have wasted nine years. i mean, that has to be some sort of weird record or something, nine years. how does that feel?}
<A>__{graham says nothing. ann picks up the camera and points it at him.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{because.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{"because"? that's not good enough. i asked you a question, graham. i asked you "how does it feel"? how does it feel, mr. i want to go down on you but i can't? do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? including me? come on, how does it feel?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i can't tell you like this.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i'm just going to keep asking until you answer. i'm sure there's plenty of tape.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting }
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{graham reaches up for the camera. ann knocks his hand away.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{not until i get some answers. tell what you feel. not what you think, i've heard plenty of that. what you feel.}
<A>__{graham is on the verge of completely falling apart.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{come on!!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{all right!! all right!! you want to know? you want to know how i feel? i feel ashamed. is that what you wanted to hear?}
<A>__{a pause. graham regains his composure somewhat.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why are you ashamed?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{jesus christ, ann. why is anybody anything? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you're not answering me.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{well, what kind of answer are you looking for, ann? what is it exactly that you want to know?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i want to know why you are the way you are!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{and i'm telling you it's not any one thing that i can point to and say "that's why!" it doesn't work that way with people who have problems, ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! it's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. things just don't happen that way.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but why can't you just put it all behind you? can't you just forget it? all that stuff you did?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no, ann, i can't. i can't forget it. it's not something i can fix. it's difficult. there s something in my mind...the way my brain works...}
<P>__{[frustrated)}
<D>__{god, ann, when you're with another person, and you re...inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much...there's no protection. and...somebody could say, or do something to you while you re in this...state of...nakedness. and they could hurt you without even knowing it. in a way that you couldn't even see.}
<P>__{(looks at ann)}
<D>__{and you would withdraw. to make sure it didn't happen again.}
<A>__{ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera down. she moves in front of graham and kneels.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i want to touch you.}
<A>__{graham shakes his head.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i want to touch you.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{ann reaches out, and graham instinctively begins to move away.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{graham.}
<A>__{something in her voice makes him stop. their eyes lock. graham slowly moves back toward her. ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his. graham closes his eyes, accepting ann's touch. she caresses him. slowly. delicately. she touches his arms, his face, his hair. closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her face. she begins to lie him back on the couch. when he offers light resistance, she gently persists.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{keep your eyes closed.}
<A>__{graham lies back, silently obeying. ann touches his face. gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to unbutton his shirt. she watches his face, hoping that he will remain calm. he does. she rubs her hand on his chest. once again she brings graham's hand to her face. she moves his hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers. soon each hand is exploring the other. fingers search for and find hidden areas. ann stands. their hands remain together, and graham's eyes remain closed. ann moves onto the couch with graham. she gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist. she slowly moves both of her hands onto graham's chest. they move forward and back, like a lazy tide. she looks at graham. his face is tranquil. ann quietly begins to move her face toward his. soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching his features. she lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. she waits for a negative reaction. getting none, she moves lower and kisses his eyes. still receiving no discouragement, she moves to his nose. a subtle movement from graham. ann waits for a moment. she then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping his face. she kisses him lightly. she kisses him again. graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck. graham's hands make their way up ann's back until they have reached her neck. he slowly pulls his face to hers. he kisses her. graham is flooded with warmth and excitement. he caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact. the kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes more passionate. for a moment, graham seems about to evaporate in a state of ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness. but his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which continues to record. graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from ann's embrace. reality slowly envelopes him.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{graham...}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm okay. it's okay.}
<A>__{ann reaches for his hand. he allows her to take it.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(almost dazed)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{graham looks at ann for a long moment. she sees the acceptance and gratitude in his eyes. she smiles lightly. graham moves forward and shuts off the camera.}
