<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted open by a crowd member. the driver and passenger side windows are then promptly busted. robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. a man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the hole in the front windshield. he is so desperate to get in the van he rips his hands to shreds. a crowd member suggests to "push it". he does so and the glass falls through. the passenger side door is opened and robbie is pulled out by the rioting crowd.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(screams) ahhhhh!!!! ray!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie?!?! robbie?!?!?}
<A>__{ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him out of the driver's side window.}

<D>__{no, just wait!!! wait!! stop!!! just stop!!!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{daddy!!!!}
<A>__{a man from the crowd runs up to rachel's window, breaks it, and tries to grab rachel. ray pulls the man out and throws him back into the crowd.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel!! (grabs guy) get out of there!!!}
<A>__{ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's side door. ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him back into the crowd.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{daddy!!!}
<A>__{ray wrestles another man trying to grab rachel. the man gets tossed to the ground. just as ray stands up... wham!!! ray is hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. the blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(grasping his head in pain) ahhh!!!}
<A>__{another man grabs ray to try to fight him. women in the crowd yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. the man who is strangling ray yells to "get in the car". robbie fought off the men who pulled him out of the car, comes over to ray's side, and begins choking the man who is choking ray. robbie hit's the man's head against the car. the man releases his grip on ray, the man and robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view. a man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{daddy!!!}
<A>__{rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling into the car through the windows. she is surrounded by people in the car. robbie and ray are getting beat in the crowd. ray manages to pull out his gun. he fires off two rounds into the air. the crowd instantly moves away from him. one man yells "take it easy!" no sign of robbie.}

<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(still determined to find robbie) robbie!!!}
<A>__{ray is able to pull robbie out from the crowd. robbie has a running bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. he is fighting to catch his breath because he had it knocked out of him.}
