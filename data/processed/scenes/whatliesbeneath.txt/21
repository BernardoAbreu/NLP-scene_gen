<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{claire and cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at the water's edge. claire tosses a long stick for cooper, who bolts out onto the long wooden dock. claire gazes at the lighthouse across the lake and a long bridge in the distance. cooper starts barking and looking down into the water. claire arrives at cooper's side and stares down into the dark water.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{cooper...what do you see?}
<A>__{she looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection. after a moment, she notices a faint white shape directly in the reflection of her face. cooper rumbles a low growl. the shape seems to be gaining definition. rrring! claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{norman }
<P>__{(on the other end)}
<D>__{i'm stuck here for another couple of hours.}
<A>__{claire's smile fades.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{unless you need me to come home...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no, no. it's fine.}
<A>__{claire slowly leans out over the water to check her reflection...}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{...but the shape is gone.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{claire?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{huh? absolutely. take your time.}
<A>__{she clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.}
