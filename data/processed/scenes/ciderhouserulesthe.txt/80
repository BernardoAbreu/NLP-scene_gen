<L>__{interior bunkhouse night}
<A>__{homer unpacks his suitcase. (his bed should be nearest muddy's and mr. rose's.) jack lies on his bed, smoking. muddy, also smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. hero and peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. mr. rose is finishing shaving. rose rose watches homer unpack.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it's just my heart.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{what you got a picture of your heart for?}
<A>__{he holds up the x ray, in order to show her.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{there's a little something wrong with it. just this part here the right ventricle. it's slightly enlarged.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{yes, so what. it's nothing serious, really. just a small defect.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{it's big enough to keep you out of the war, i suppose. ain't that right?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{rose rose picks up the book that homer has put on the bed. she studies the cover; it's "great expectations" by charles dickens. she puts it down, restlessly.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{they told me i was too old to serve.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{they told muddy his feet was too flat!}
<A>__{everybody laughs, except muddy.}
<C>__{muddy}
<P>__{(to peaches)}
<D>__{and you was "generally unfit," as i recall.}
<A>__{finished unpacking, homer sits on his bed; he picks up "great expectations" and begins to read. rose rose sits down next to him, watching him read. homer notices her interest.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{do you like to read?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{i can't read. nobody taught me.}
<A>__{homer smiles politely and goes back to his book. rose rose keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(pointing to the page)}
<D>__{what does it say there?}
<A>__{homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, smoking, listening. (like bedtime stories at the orphanage, he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, reserved.)}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"i looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude."}
<A>__{homer looks up; there's no response.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(to rose rose)}
<D>__{more?}
<A>__{some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. rose rose wants more, but suddenly jack jumps out of bed and stomps to the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper is tacked to the wall. jack is talking to homer all the way.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{since you're the one who's smart enough to read... what's this?}
<A>__{jack points at the piece of paper. homer gets up and looks at it.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it's a list of rules, it seems.}
<A>__{all the men groan jack swears and peaches laughs.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{whose rules?}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{they're for us, i suppose.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go on and read 'em, homer.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"one. please don't smoke in bed."}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{it's too late for that one!}
<A>__{all the smokers laugh and cough in their beds.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<P>__{(uncharacteristically blunt)}
<D>__{stop it, homer. they aren't our rules. we didn't write them. i don't see no reason to read them.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{rose rose stomps back to her bed. her father absently snaps his towel.}
