<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you fuckers!}
<A>__{eddie comes to kick welles in the face. welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose. he lays there, stunned, weeping. eddie pries the 8mm film from welles' hand, tosses it... dino catches the film. machine comes to drag welles towards the bed. dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it. machine handcuffs welles to the metal bedframe. welles falls to his knees, holding his face. eddie punches welles in the head.}

<C>__{welles}
<D>__{don't... please...}
<A>__{dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid, takes out matches, light one, drops it... the 8mm film goes up in flame... welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself towards the flame, dragging the bed... the film is destroyed by flame... welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{and so it ends. it's as if she never existed.}
<A>__{welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{don't blame yourself. you were in way over your head.}
<A>__{he looks to max's corpse, to the smoldering film... swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...}

<D>__{motherfuckers. small time, motherfuckers... ! tell me something...}
<A>__{welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.}
<C>__{welles}

<A>__{machine, dino and eddie stand between longdale and the car with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{what were you thinking?}
<A>__{welles watches as machine, dino and eddie back slowly away from longdale. longdale's gun hand is shaky... welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch... longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio so he can get to the car...}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{back off! everything's been taken care of, and i'm leaving now...}

<A>__{machine, eddie and dino are held at bay...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you're not gonna live through this.}
<A>__{welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in the cuff, bed screeching across the floor... machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder, touches the handle of a huge knife sheathed to his back.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{our business is done, i'm leaving, no one's going to stop me...}
<A>__{longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to make a run for it. dino velvet takes a step forward...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{machine unsheathes the knife and throws... thunk! the knife imbeds to the hilt in longdale's chest and longdale's gun fires... dino velvet flies backwards, shot in the face! dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his face, blood pouring out between his fingers. longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged out in surprise. he looks down at the knife in his chest. machine lets out a scream, runs to dino... machine falls to his knees and grips dino, tries to hold him. dino's screaming, squirming frantically... longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{eddie comes to look down at the longdale. longdale falls back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw. welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table... eddie spins, looks across to see welles struggling... dino breaks free from machine, runs blindly, still holding his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up... eddie runs towards welles. dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still. machine rises, looking at dino. tears come out from machine's eyes and roll down his mask. one last gasp and shudder from dino's body; death rattle. welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the socket, desperately clawing towards the table... the table is mere feet away... eddie arrives, kick welles in the ribs... welles recoils. eddies kicks again. welles curls into a ball. eddie kicks again...}
<C>__{machine }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{eddie stops, looks to machine.}
<C>__{machine}
<D>__{he's mine!}
<A>__{machine strides over the longdale's corpse, puts his foot on longdale's chest, yanks out the knife... machine starts this way... eddie backs from welles. welles looks up, trying to shake off unconsciousness, sees machine coming... welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate... reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no, no, no... please, don't kill me... please... !}
<A>__{machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts welles' head back by the hair, brings the knife hand back...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{do him good.}
<A>__{welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, stabbing scissors deep in machine stomach... machine roars, falling back, pitching forward... machine's knife clatters to the ground. eddie's eyes go wide. machine hits the floor, clutching his guts. welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off... eddie moves forward, furious... welles grabs machine's knife, wielding it, holding eddie off.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{back off, eddie...}
<A>__{welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table. eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away. eddie turns, looks across the warehouse... there's his gun, lying there, far away. eddie runs for the gun. welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun, knocks the table over. he's got the gun, but... bullets hit the floor as the table falls. welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand, gets it open, holds it between his knees... welles grabs a bullet... eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air... machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with trembling hands... welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises, taking aim across the warehouse...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{stop eddie!}
<A>__{eddie's running...}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(pulls back the hammer)}
<D>__{i swear to christ i will shoot you in the back... !}
<A>__{eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun... machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach. welles points his gun at machine.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{come back, or i put a hole in him.}
<A>__{eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you might make it to your gun, but not before i shoot machine. and if i have to shoot him because of you, and i don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you.}

<C>__{welles}
<D>__{take it off!}
<C>__{machine}
<D>__{you got one bullet.}
<A>__{welles looks to see eddie heading back, keeps the gun on machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the door behind him...}
<C>__{machine}
<D>__{the only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you.}
<A>__{welles backs away, drags the bedframe. eddie's getting close. welles points the gun at eddie. eddie slows. welles points the gun at machine, points the gun at eddie. welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, fires... breaks the handcuff chain. welles bolts to the door...}
<C>__{machine}
<D>__{get the gun!}
<A>__{eddie runs back towards his gun. machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door, but agony doubles him back over to his knees.}
