<B>__{black}
<A>__{as we hear the click of a pull string the camera is dropping: down past an orange safe light, down the length of the string, down to a metal darkroom tray where two short strips of negative are burning. visser's hand and yellow sleeve cuff (now orange) enter frame, with an 8 x 10 black and white photograph. the photograph is dropped into the tray. as it burns we see that it is the same picture of abby's and ray's "corpses" as visser showed marty, except that in this print the bullet holes and blood are less convincingly brushed in. another print is dropped into the tray and ignites. in this one we see bullet holes but no blood. a third print is dropped in and ignites. it is the original undoctored shot of abby and ray asleep in bed. visser's hands enter frame holding the picture envelope that he took away from marty's office. visser rips it in half and is about to drop it into the tray, but stops abruptly. there is posterboard, not a photograph, peeking out of the torn envelope. visser's hands pull the two halves of the placard from the envelope and fit them together. the stenciled 8 x 10 placard says: "all employees must wash hands before resuming work." low angle close shot visser staring at the placard in disbelief. after a moment his hand rises into frame to deposit a cigarette in his mouth. his hand drops back down, groping in a pocket. his hand jumps back into frame, empty; he thumps at his breast pockets; he can't find his lighter. he wheels and exits frame. the light snaps off. a door slams shut. abby's apartment day}
<B>__{close shot ray}
<A>__{he has dozed off in his chair. offscreen we hear a door slam, and his eyes open.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{emerging from the bathroom. her voice has a flat echo in the bare apartment.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why didn't you get into bed?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{i didn't think i could sleep. i'm surprised you could. are you all right?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{she walks over and sits down on the bed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...you called me this morning.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{abby looks at him, expecting more. finally:}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...i just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. i took care of everything. now all we have to do is keep our heads.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...what do you mean?}
<A>__{ray finally looks directly at her.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i know about it, abby. i went to the bar last night.}
<A>__{abby is looking at him in alarm.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what happened? was meurice there?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he laughs shortly.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...he didn't see me, though. nobody saw me.}
<A>__{the chair grates back as he stands up and looks vaguely around the room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...is it cold in here?}
<A>__{abby is looking at him nervously.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well... what happened?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...}
<A>__{he starts nervously pacing around the room, looking for something.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...what's important is what we do now; i mean we can't go around half cocked. what we need is some time to think about this, figure it out...}
<A>__{he moves a packing crate aside, still hunting around the apartment.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...anyway, we got some time now. but we gotta be smart.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ray }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. and when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...}
<A>__{ray's pacing is more agitated as he looks distractedly around the apartment.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...because if he's not dead he's gonna get up and try and kill you.}
<A>__{he pauses, seemingly at a total loss.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...that's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn where the hell's my windbreaker?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what the hell happened, ray?}
<A>__{ray is walking to the window. sunlight streams in around him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that ain't important. what's important is that we did it. that's the only thing that matters. we both did it for each other...}
<A>__{he stoops down to look through a pile of clothes by the window.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...that's what's important.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{ray's head snaps around. staring at her he slowly rises to his feet and then remains still.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i... i mean what're you talking about, ray? i haven't done anything funny.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...what was that?}
<A>__{abby, startled, can't contain her agitation anymore.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(rapidly)}
<D>__{ray, i mean you ain't even acting like yourself. first you call me at five in the a.m. saying all kinds of nice things over the telephone and then you come charging in here scaring me half to death without even telling me what it is i'm supposed to be scared of. i gotta tell you it's extremely rattling.}
<B>__{ray}
<A>__{we track toward him, isolating him against the window. he is perfectly still. for a long time he can't speak.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{...don't lie to me, abby }
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{still worked up.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{how can i be lying if i don't even know }
<A>__{the ring of the telephone cuts her off. she looks at the phone, pauses for a moment, then continues, struggling.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...i mean if you and him had a fight or something, i don't care, as long as you...}
<A>__{her voice trails off. the telephone won't stop ringing. abby and ray are staring at each other, seemingly oblivious to it. finally:}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...pick it up.}
<B>__{close shot telephone}
<A>__{still ringing. abby's hand enters frame and picks it up.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what.}
<A>__{through the phone we hear only the rhythmic whir of a ceiling fan. abby shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard. it is the same sound we heard earlier when she picked up the phone at ray's house. as before, the line clicks dead.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(looking at ray)}
<D>__{...welp, that was him.}
<A>__{there is a long moment of silence. then ray's voice comes from across the room:}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...who?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{marty.}
<A>__{there is silence again.}
<B>__{long shot the apartment}
<A>__{ray shifts in front of the window. he laughs humorlessly. the laugh stops abruptly.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...what's going on with you two?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{he starts across the room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...you can call him back, whoever it was...}
<A>__{he is heading for the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...i will get out of your way.}
<A>__{he pauses at the foyer and pulls abby's gun out of his pocket. he sets it on a shelf by the door.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{watching. we hear the door open.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{you left your weapon behind.}
<A>__{we hear the door slam shut.}
<B>__{close shot ceiling fan}
<A>__{we hear the rhythmic whir of the fan. we tilt down from the ceiling to reveal that we are in the living room of ray's bungalow. in the foreground visser sits in a chair with the cradled telephone in his lap, facing the front door, which stands open in the background. the contents of abby's tote bag lie strewn on the bureau next to visser. her purse is not there. after a moment visser rouses himself and starts to sweep the articles back into the tote bag.}
