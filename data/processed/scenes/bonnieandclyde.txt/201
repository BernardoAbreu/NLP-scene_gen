<L>__{interior bedroom. moss farm. night.}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde's bedroom, the middle of that night. both are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed. both are staring into the night, disquiet.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{bonnie? bonnie, will you marry me?}
<A>__{there is a silent gasp from bonnie, a barely perceptible stiffening. then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still staring up at the ceiling.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{how could i do that, clyde? you know it's impossible. we'd have to go to a justice of the peace and the justice of the peace is a lawman. we couldn't even take out a license.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{hey now, you sound like you been givin' it some thought on your own.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(with a grim irony,}
<D>__{her voice getting}
<P>__{more and more emotional)}
<D>__{oh no, i never gave it thought. i haven't thought about it at least ten times a day, i haven't thought about it every minute of my life since i met you.}
<P>__{(suddenly her voice cracks into tears)}
<A>__{she flings herself violently across the bed and buries herself into clyde's chest, her knees drawn up, her head tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(a bit startled by}
<D>__{this, attempting to hold her, awkwardly, and placate her. he}
<P>__{puts his arm around her)}
<D>__{bonnie...are you crying, honey?}
<A>__{bonnie nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(her face still}
<D>__{buried in clyde's}
<P>__{chest, she whispers)}
<D>__{clyde, why do you want to marry me?}
<A>__{clyde thinks a minute and then grins.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(in an attempt to be humorous)}
<D>__{to make an honest woman out of you.}
<A>__{bonnie is silent.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(finally, in a voice}
<D>__{charged with}
<P>__{anticipation and dream)}
<D>__{clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us?}
<A>__{clyde thinks about it a minute.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well...i guess i'd do it all different. first off, i wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs. we'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state...and...}
<A>__{suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he could have, that it was not the answer bonnie wanted to hear. he looks down at her, his voice anxious.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bonnie?}
<A>__{she is silent.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, bonnie?}
<A>__{but she does not answer.}
