<L>__{interior masseria's limousine day}
<A>__{charlie sits in the back with masseria, who's clearly in a foul mood. vito drives, anxiously watching the boss in the mirror.}

<D>__{where we headed?}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{wassa matter, mr. big shot. don't have time for my business no more?}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{boss, i got all the time you need.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{i know about you.}
<A>__{ignoring the taunt, luciano turns and looks out the window.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{that little party's gonna make you a lotta money.}

<D>__{money don't mean shit!}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{didn't know you felt that way.}
<A>__{masseria hauls off and backhands charlie across the face.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{don't you smart talk me!}
<A>__{charlie stares at masseria, stone faced. wanting to kill this bastard, but the time ain't right.}
<B>__{outside the limousine}
<A>__{as it pulls up past a car parked halfway up the sidewalk. next to it stands one of masseria's henchmen. it's a narrow street in the garment district, little more than a alleyway between two broad avenues. runners push racks of clothes. trucks making deliveries clog the passage of traffic.}
<B>__{back in the limo}
<A>__{masseria slaps a pistol into charlie's palm.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you and vito are gonna pull that payroll job. right now.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{you gotta plan these things.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{and i got it all planned.}
<A>__{in the front seat, vito nods for charlie to go along. the pistol lays in charlie's lap, aimed at masseria. charlie's finger strokes the trigger. masseria notices and baits him with the unnerving calm of the truly mad.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{go ahead, charlie. we can always fight this out in hell.}
<A>__{charlie lifts the pistol off his lap and trains it on the boss.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you're wasting my time, charlie.}
<A>__{battling his every instinct, charlie lowers the pistol and slips it into his jacket.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you'll never be the boss. you're too in love with livin'.}
<B>__{charlie and vito climb out of the limo}
<A>__{and the henchman climbs behind the wheel.}
<C>__{henchman}
<D>__{the motor's runnin'.}
<A>__{they watch as the limo maneuvers through the obstacle course of traffic. they turn and look toward the bank building that sits at the end of the alleyway on seventh avenue. as they pass the getaway car, charlie slows, fighting the urge to flee.}
