<A>__{among the tiers, jedi are slowly being driven back. they have killed heaps of geonosians and have kncoked out piles of droids, but sheer numbers are telling. individual jedi are being cut down or blasted the rest are retreating into the arena. anakin and padme are back to back, fighting droids and flying geonosians. mace windu fights fiercely with jango fett. finally, the bounty hunter falls. his helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. the bounty hunter's body falls to the ground. mace windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back to back with obi wan, as they swipe and mangle droids.}
