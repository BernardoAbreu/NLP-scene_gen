<L>__{exterior clark secondary after school}
<A>__{seth and evan walk out the front door.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i mean, what are we going to tell the girls? "sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents!" we'll never get laid because of that little ass fuck. how did he get in to state?! he's got shit for brains! shit! how else can we get liquor?}
<C>__{fogell }
<D>__{hey guys!}
<A>__{seth and evan turn around to see fogell running after them.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah! you almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! you better fucking have it, where is it?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i got it. it's flawless! it's great, man, look.}
<A>__{fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake id. evan grabs it.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(reading the card)}
<D>__{okay mr..."mclovin"? what kind of a stupid name is that? what are you trying to be, an irish r&b singer?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so you picked mclovin?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{it was between that or muhammad.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{why was it between that or muhammad? why didn't you just pick a common name?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{actually, seth, muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{have you ever actually met a guy named muhammad?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{have you actually ever met a guy named mclovin?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no! that's why you picked a bad name.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name muhammad on a fake id!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. it just says "name: mclovin"}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{one name?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i just thought mclovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your id?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{she could ask. or, i could just show it to her.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{holy shit! i don't believe this. this says you're fucking 25! why didn't you just put 21?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i knew you would ask that. look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake id's trying to act like joe casual. each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. just how many 21 year olds do you think there are?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fool!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{calm down! it's not terrible! this might work, but it's up to you, fogell. they'll either think, "oh, it's another punk kid with a fake id." or, "look, it's mclovin, the twenty five year old organ donor". what's it gonna be?}
<A>__{fogell takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i am mclovin.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you're not mclovin. no one's mclovin and this is never going to work. we need a new way to get alcohol. could we drive to canada or something?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i still think it's going to work.}
<A>__{they walk into the staff parking lot. seth stops.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck? where's my car?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i told you, man! what did i say? i told you that was a dumb idea.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{why would you park in the staff }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{shut up, fogell.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{`cause you're not staff.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i am aware of that, fagell.}
<A>__{seth storms off. evan follows him.}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{will you still pick me up from work?}
<A>__{evan and seth round the corner, leaving fogell behind.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{let's go to your house.}
