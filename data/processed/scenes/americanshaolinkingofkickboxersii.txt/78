<A>__{it is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above. angle on a monk, inside the waterfall he is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders onto him.}
<B>__{angle on d.s. and group}
<A>__{as they stand on the bank.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{concentrate on your stance. all i want you to do is try to hold your stance. li, you're first.}
<A>__{li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes behind the thundering water. he moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance. he stand there, immovable. after a moment, he turns to look at d.s.}
<B>__{angle on d.s.}
<A>__{who motions him farther into the water.}
<B>__{angle on li}
<A>__{who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. as soon as he gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he falls about 20 feet into the pool below.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{nexterior..}
<A>__{each of them try it in turn. everyone fails. gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{it's his turn. he walks to the waterfall and goes in. he picks up an umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "new york giants nfl" logo on it unmistakably american). he walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment. drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse stance. he turns to smile at the d.s., and then waves at the others. as soon as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams him and off he goes into the pool. he lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. drew comes to the surface, still clutching the now destroyed umbrella. he smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.}

<D>__{thought i'd join you guys.}
