<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a shot of buddy half asleep in bed. the light of the lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. the camera comes back and we see rose in her nightgown standing by his bedside. she is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i hate to turn on this light, you daddy's awake downstairs, but i have to take the chance.}
<P>__{(sits by him on bed)}
<D>__{buddy, please don't tell on me.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(rather coolly)}
<D>__{i said i wouldn't.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(her lip trembles)}
<D>__{buddy, i have to ask you, as bad as i've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what i did. i know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. but mostly it was dumb, i didn't mean you no harm, i'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. i love you. but they'd think i did, they'd think i was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...}
<A>__{rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.}
