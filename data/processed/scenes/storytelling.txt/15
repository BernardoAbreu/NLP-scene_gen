<A>__{a lower east side tenement apartment. a dogma '95 poster hangs above the bed. toby, down and out and in his thirties, leafs through his high school yearbook. he reads an inscription: 'toby, i just know you're going to become a movie star! please don't forget me when you make it to the top! i will always love you pam'. he picks up his phone and dials.}
