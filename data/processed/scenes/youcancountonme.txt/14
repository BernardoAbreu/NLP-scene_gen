<A>__{sammy sits in front of brian's desk. brian is behind the desk listening.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ so i always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. anyway, larry never minded about it and i was just hoping it would be ok with you too...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well samantha i realize that scottsville is not exactly a major banking center...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{no it's not...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no i know it's not... but it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. and that means i don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? does your husband work in the area? do you }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh no rudy sr. isn't "on the scene." so to speak.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well, i can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well brian? i understand what you're saying, and i think it's great. i do. because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. believe me. but i've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if i take the time out of my lunch hour...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. ok?}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{i will do my best...!}
<A>__{brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{how old's your son?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{he's eight.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's a terrific age.}
