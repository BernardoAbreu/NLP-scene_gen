<L>__{interior bookstore day}
<A>__{half a dozen people wander the isles. maurice's eyes drift to a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the store. one boy disappears behind "philosophy" and reappears momentarily with his sweat shirt zipped up to his neck a rectangle is outlined under his shirt.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i see that!}
<A>__{maurice comes around the corner the boys haul ass out of the store. they're long gone before maurice reaches the door. he yells after them.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i'm getting a doberman! two!}
<A>__{ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts, comes out when she hears the commotion.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you've been saying that for two years; i think they know you're bluffing.}
<A>__{maurice inspects the "philosophy" section. maurice looks up as a young man, early twenties, hurries in. kris reddy walks past maurice, his black locks of hair peeking out from under his philadelphia eagles cap.}
<C>__{kris}
<P>__{(to maurice)}
<D>__{lizy bennett?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{hi kris.}
<A>__{kris waves as he removes his jacket. he is wearing a parker books t shirt underneath. he pins an "assistant manager" tag on. maurice thinks to himself.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{lizy, eliza... elizabeth bennett...}
<P>__{(the answer comes to him)}
<D>__{pride and prejudice.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{you're amazing.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{it has to be a full character's name.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{they called her 'lizy' in the book...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sorry i was late. my jeep died on the way over from the paper.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{they printed your article on, 'dry verses can dog food'... very enlightening.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{pulitzer, here i come.}
<A>__{kris notices as maurice goes back to searching the isles.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{never have children. if they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(on the end of his words)}
<D>__{kris, go to the pharmacy. ask mr. donnavan to get you a large bottle of geritol... tell him, maurice has officially become a grumpy old man.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{what'd they take this time?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{nietzsche!... as if they're going to read nietzsche.}
<A>__{maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{they pick on you because they can get a rise out of you... children can sense those things.}
<A>__{kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a mini tape recorder. he talks into it dead serious.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{monday august 24... juvenile delinquency are the victims to blame?}
<A>__{click. the tape recorder returns to the bag. ellen stares at him curiously.}
<C>__{kris}
<D>__{story ideas. i will forget them otherwise.}
<A>__{ellen nods with realization. ellen and kris turn their attention to maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily. he looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of school boys waving at him tauntingly.}
