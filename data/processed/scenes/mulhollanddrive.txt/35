<A>__{the cab driver puts betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to her. she can barely stop looking at the building long enough to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away. betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working fountain at its center. a sign on a door to her right reads manager and she rings the bell. an older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make up and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door. an unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen of the still closed screen door.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{hi there...ten bucks says you're betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i am, mrs. lanois. it is mrs. lanois isn't it?}
<C>__{mrs. lanois}
<D>__{in all my living glory, baby.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{mrs. lanois}
<D>__{you can call me coco ... everybody does. stay there, i will get the key.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay, coco.}
<A>__{coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling a huge drag off her cigarette. she starts off into the courtyard and betty picks up her bags and follows. as coco speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{i guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. nice man... farmer i hear.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yes, he is. he raises corn.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well, i ...}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me. it's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress. i just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i...}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{you probably don't remember her, but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29. when she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{have many famous actors and actresses lived here? i was meaning to ask you that.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.}
<A>__{a haunting music begins to swell.}
<C>__{coco }
<D>__{people say in the springtime when the wind blows the smell of the jasmine you can still feel the presence of everyone of them.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i guess i've come to quite a place.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.}
<A>__{the music fades. coco looks down suddenly. on the cobblestone courtyard in front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog. she angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.}
<C>__{coco }
<P>__{(yelling up)}
<D>__{wilkins! ...}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{... that dog craps once more out here and i will bake his butt for breakfast!!}
<A>__{coco turns back to betty.}
<C>__{coco }
<D>__{you don't have pets do you?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{that's good. they're allowed, but i don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. you wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i can hardly wait, coco.}
