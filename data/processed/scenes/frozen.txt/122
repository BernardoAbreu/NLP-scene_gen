<D>__{the poor thing. she's just a puppy. she won't understand that i died. she's gonna think i left her. that i forgot about her. all she wants is for me to come home. she's probably waiting by the door for me right now. every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if i'm going to walk in. but i won't. i won't ever walk in. and shayna's going to starve to death. the poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault.}

<D>__{eat. she's always late. but she brings all of the desserts. and she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. it's so good. and after dinner my dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. and my sister, my mom, and i watch a christmas story until the marathon is over. and that's how you know christmas is really over. when ralphie gets his red rider carbine action two hundred shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming.}
