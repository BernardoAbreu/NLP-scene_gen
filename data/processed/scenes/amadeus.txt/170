<A>__{salieri bows his head. joseph places the chain around his neck. the crowd claps. salieri makes to kiss his hand, but joseph restrains him, and passes on. cavalieri, smiling adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up. the crowd all flock to salieri with cries and words of approval. all want to shake his hand. they tug and pat him. but he has eyes for only one man he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him. mozart stands there. eagerly salieri moves to him.}
