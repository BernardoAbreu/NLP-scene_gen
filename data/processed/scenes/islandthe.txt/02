<L>__{interior. subway portal sector four day}
<A>__{the portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as an "ethergate." residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners, the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.}
<L>__{interior subway platform sector four day}
<A>__{the subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not unlike our own. in place of escalators, moving walkways deliver the residents onto the platform. along the platform wall runs a strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl: next stop... sector 5 sector 6 centerville... at the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the residents wait in a patient line, lincoln among them. his focus is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.}
<D>__{resident #1 a stim unit says it hits the wall. resident #2 okay . but i get to set the can.}
<A>__{resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. resident #2 ducks under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. or what looks like a track. the struts lining the bed are not sleepers but buffers of galvanized rubber. nor are there any rails. the relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the buffers to run in twin parallel. known as "lode poles," they now start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.}
<D>__{resident #1 hurry it up. the shuttle's coming.}
<A>__{resident #2 regains the platform. we push in on the drink can, balanced on a buffer. it starts rattling. then suddenly shoots upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall, clattering into obscurity. resident #1 whoops in victory. a rush of air heralds the shuttle. it sails out of the tunnel, floating three feet above the track. a hybrid of subway car and nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on a catamaran. it is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the lode poles, an invisible river known as a "lode stream". the shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. its gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence lowers. lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.}
