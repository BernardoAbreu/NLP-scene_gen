<L>__{interior hammer's room}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{oh, shit... go around to the door and toss me the glasses.}
<A>__{maggie walks around the corner, and sees the suicide standing there. she quickly backpedals back to where she was before.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{that idea ain't gonna work, you gotta plan b?}
<A>__{she looks back through the glass for rafkin, and spots the hammer is standing right behind him, smiling. rafkin reacts to maggie's panicked look.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the hammer raises his weapon, about to swing down on rafkin. maggie quickly points to the side away from the hammer.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{rafkin jumps over as the hammer swings. the hammer strikes the floor where rafkin just was. sparks fly. rafkin nervously looks at maggie.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{the spells? where... are... the... spells?}
<A>__{maggie checks the floor. she notices the glowing spells, but rafkin's not standing on them. the hammer's now gone... maggie pushes both of her hands forward.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{back!!}
<A>__{rafkin hops back, like a little frog, just as the hammer reappears and swings, missing rafkin and hitting an invisible wall. more sparks fly. rafkin's sweating profusely now. he doesn't move. he's standing on the spells. one wrong step and he's dead. he glances around knowing the hammer's presence is very close by. the exit door is about ten feet away. he'd never be able to make a run for it.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you have to... lead me... out.}
<A>__{maggie looks down at the path of spells on the floor, and it's a jagged path to the door. then she sees the hammer standing over rafkin like an executioner, waiting to bring down his ax. one wrong step, and...}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{oh, crap.}
<A>__{rafkin looks at her hopefully. maggie nods.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{okay. right foot. step right.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{right?}
<A>__{maggie nods. rafkin raises his right foot, hovering it over the floor, looking for maggie to okay the step. she nods again. rafkin takes the step. rafkin squints, ready to get hit. but the hammer's gone.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{whew...}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{left foot.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{left foot?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{right foot?}
<A>__{maggie waves and shakes her head.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{left foot. forward.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{it's like playing friggin' twister here.}
<A>__{rafkin sets his left foot forward. again he's safe. maggie nods, motioning him straight, onward. another safe step. he might just make it out of here alive after all. and that's when maggie sees the suicide turn the corridor and she's coming right at her. maggie, scared out of her wits, wants to run, but she still has to deal with rafkin.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{another right.}
<A>__{rafkin goes to take a step with his right foot, and walk right off the spells. maggie's not watching, she's more concerned with the suicide heading in her direction. maggie turns back just in time and sees the hammer right in front of rafkin }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{shit! just jump!}
<A>__{rafkin takes a flying leap towards the door. he makes it out safely, and rushes over to maggie. gives her a big "thank you" kiss on the lips.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{i owe you big time.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{fine. just get me outta here.}
