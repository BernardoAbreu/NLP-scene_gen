<A>__{viktor has transformed his soundstage into a one man publicity machine. the floor is littered with photographs of simone in various states of dress and undress. using a sophisticated photoshop computer program, viktor constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine spreads "time", "people", "us", "life", "popular mechanics".}

<D>__{ we don't do the photo shoot, you don't get the cover... written answers to written questions, that's right... website interviews, no problem.}
<A>__{viktor calls up a "dance option". choosing from a hula dancer, a belly dancer and a classical ballerina, he removes simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. she begins to dance for him. he uses a program to construct childhood photographs of simone and other childhood memorabilia. he employs backgrounds from numerous on line library sources. with a quick cut and paste he is able to place simone on a beach in san tropez or a bicycle factory in calcutta.}
