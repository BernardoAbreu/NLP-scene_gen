<A>__{riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. he begins to physically move the torpedo tube itself like he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...}
<B>__{worf and the security guards}
<A>__{are about fifty feet away from riker. from their prone positions, they try to keep the borg at bay, blasting them off the hull one by one. they have taken cover behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of the ship. the borg have to cross an open field of metal to get to them, making then easy targets. suddenly the borg change tactics. from the deflector dish high above them, borg begin launching themselves directly at the starfleet officers, jumping off the dish and flying through the vacuum of space like paratroopers. this tips the balance. there are too many targets to defend from above and below. one of the flying borg crashes into a security guard and a vicious hand to hand fight erupts. the borg slashes the guard's pressure suit, which depressurizes killing the man instantly. worf fires a phaser blast into the borg, knocking him off the hull and into space. worf turns to riker.}

<A>__{swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the deflector dish. he hits a control on the side of the tube... and a quantum torpedo automatically slides up from below and locks into position in the tube, like a panel on the torpedo and begins working on the circuitry.}
