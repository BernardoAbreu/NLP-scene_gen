<L>__{interior rick and debbie's apartment night}
<A>__{rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen living room. he has about five dishes going at once as he dashes from stove to refrigerator. he grabs some hamburger meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. he then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty. debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs him tightly, kissing him sweetly.}

<P>__{(between kisses)}

<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(looking at the stove)}
<D>__{i think your dinner's burning.}
<A>__{rick crosses to the stove. a small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans. he douses it with water.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{don't worry... it's supposed to do this.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(setting the table)}
<D>__{want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower. it's really gonna be fun.}
