<L>__{exterior bellagio casino night}
<A>__{the white van (now clean of the "nevada telecom" sign) idles before the bellagio, its windows tinted, the driver's identity inscrutable. it is swarmed by security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{your guards will load the bags into the van's rear. if anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything.}
<A>__{the guards carry out the money and load it into the van's rear. there, they find a video camera mounted within the back seat of the van monitoring them. still they cannot catch a glimpse of the driver. they close the van doors. bellagio from high above the white van departs the valet station in front, clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. meanwhile, behind the casino, a swat van arrives and unloads its squad.}
