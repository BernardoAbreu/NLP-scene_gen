<L>__{exterior new york city street same time}
<A>__{on the street, cars scream to stops, people gasp. doom strides up to ben, and raises the electricity pole for the death blow. currents surge. right before he swings down }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i can't let you do that.}
<A>__{simple, strong. doom turns to see...reed. alone. bruised and battered. slowly stepping toward him. doom smiles.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{and you can't stop me.}
<A>__{he turns back to ben, raises the pole, but...he can't swing down! something is holding the pole in mid air. something invisible.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{hello susan.}
<A>__{she turns visible, holding back the pole with a forcefield. using her power, she flings the pole from doom's grip. it skids along the street. reed helps ben to his feet. doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{what is this? the pitiful three?}
<A>__{doom steps toward them, but }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{four.}
<A>__{whooosh! johnny swoops down, hurling a fireball like a flamethrower, knocking doom back. johnny takes his place alongside the others. the four of them stand as one. johnny turns to thing.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{had a little relapse, huh?}
<A>__{thing starts to retort, but johnny gives a warm smile.}
<C>__{johnny }
<D>__{welcome back.}
<A>__{they turn to doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed and melted, making him look all the more menacing.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{this is going to be fun.}
<A>__{electricity starts to course through his body. he stands at the foot of the crater ben made. he thrusts down, grabbing a thick power cable, ripping it out of the street! he snaps the cable into two snaking, lashing strips. he holds tight, absorbing the power. lights flicker and dim in buildings around him. windows blow! doom glows, amped up. he lets go of the cables! the two deadly wires snake out of control! pedestrians scatter, panic. reed sees the wires slashing through the air. he makes a move: reed streeetches his arms, reaching for the deadly cables. doom fires superpowered energy bolts. the electric charges surge through the air toward the fantastic four, but sue tosses her force fields, exploding doom's blasts in mid flight. she keeps her hands up, blocking blows like a prize fighter. one of doom's bolts glances off her force field and smashes into a concrete stanchion of a building! the pillar starts to crumble, with people huddled under the overhang! they're about to be crushed by the falling concrete! but suddenly, the concrete roof holds steady...because...ben is holding it up! he stands beside the stanchion, like atlas holding the world. people run out, safe. on the street: reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{johnny! spot weld!}
<A>__{johnny flies toward him, and uses his flames to weld the wires back together. sparks fly. the cables start to fuse. doom keeps firing. sue struggles with her force fields. the impact is too much. her nose starts to bleed.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{can't...hold...on...}
<A>__{doom smiles. reed sees her. she is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but..............reed stretches his whole body! he expands himself across the street, and grabs a tree, so he forms a wall between sue and doom. doom keeps firing his bolts. they slam into reed's body, rubberband his skin, and distend out his back without breaking. he strains, agonizing.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{johnny. supernova.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{but all these people...}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{johnny charges toward doom flames on his body starting build to a blinding white intensity, engulfing everything. johnny grabs doom.}
<C>__{thing}
<P>__{(quiet, smiling)}
<D>__{flame on, kid.}
<A>__{flash! johnny explodes in a pulse of bright white light, which starts to heat up everything surrounding it. reed doesn't miss a beat. he's in total command now.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration }
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(looking at doom)}
<D>__{i'm sure i can come up with something.}
<A>__{she concentrates. she sees johnny holding onto doom and the growing heat and light. sue shuts her eyes. a giant force field explodes from her body. a massive wave of energy. it swoops past a car, which warps, melts (half the car is not inside the force field). thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them. sue's force field envelops johnny's supernova, containing it in a bright sphere of energy. the light increases, to the point that it's blinding. people look away. finally, johnny's supernova fades. he collapses to the ground, exhausted, smoking. sue exhales and falls to her knees. her force field fades. the light flickers out. as everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...thud. thud. and doom steps through the smoke. unharmed. his metallic body glows white, trailing molten metal. sue, ben, johnny look devastated. they can't beat him. he looks at reed.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{is that the best you can do...? a little heat...?}
<A>__{reed stays perfectly calm. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{time for your lesson, vic. chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{ben...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{got it, teach.}
<A>__{he kicks open the fire hydrant. the water geysers up! ben kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays toward reed, who...twists his torso so... the water curls around his chest, races down his arms, and shoots right off his wrists toward doom!}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{doom rushes toward reed, but the water flies out, dousing doom. giant clouds of steam fill the air from the cooling metal. doom screams. his shrieks finally fade to silence. the water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely obscuring doom from view. a beat. the steam clears to reveal: doom. a true statue now a hard, cold solid piece of metal. frozen forever. reed, sue, ben, and johnny the fantastic four exhale. they stand as one, in roiling smoke. a beat.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{damn, i love this job.}
<A>__{reed and sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{job, huh...?}
<A>__{will they accept their mantle? reed shrugs.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{well, we do have the suits...}
<A>__{they give weary smiles. a team. sue gets close to reed.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you know, about what we said up there, i think maybe }
<A>__{thhm! he kisses her. his neck extending. strong, powerful. he pulls back slightly, smiles at her. a new strength in him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{funny how things turn out, isn't it?}
<A>__{sue looks at reed. a long way from that conference room.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{hilarious.}
<A>__{as they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding. the sun rises around them. the fantastic four step into the new dawn of a new day. and we slowly dissolve to : }
