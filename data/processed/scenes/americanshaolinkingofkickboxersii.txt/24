<A>__{drew walks up and says hello.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{hello, ladies! can you tell me how to get to the shaolin temple?}
<A>__{they titter with laughter, covering their mouths with their hands. drew is not really amused, however, he is frustrated and tired.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the shaolin temple? how hard can that be? geez, doesn't anyone speak english here?}
<B>__{angle on ashema}

<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(not without pride)}
<D>__{i am going to join the temple as a monk.}
<A>__{ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. they gesture to drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts at martial arts movements.}
<C>__{ashema }
<D>__{i'm going that way i can take you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you have a car?}
<C>__{ashema}
