<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{lunch remains are on the table as nell enters, test papers in hand.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{jim? i'm done.}
<A>__{but marrow isn't there. she's about to go back out to look for him, but sees something and stops. forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room. barely visible. marrow's briefcase. nell goes to the briefcase, knowing she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself. marrow's digital recorder glints out at her. nell takes it out, and presses play. she looks up at the door. any minute he could come back in here... and then marrow's voice rings out.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{...the hallway discussion about last night's fireplace incident concluded at three a.m. nell continues her alienation of the other subjects and the experimenter. it remains unclear whether she truly believes she did not deface the painting. interview with the subject in greenhouse yesterday to ascertain the extent of her self delusion was inconclusive due to her efforts to sexualize encounter with experimenter.}
<A>__{marrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but nell isn't hearing anything anymore. she dies inside. her world upside down. she falls into a chair, and all we can hear of marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his garbled jargon.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{one minute!}
<A>__{it's marrow, for real, about to enter. nell clicks off the recorder, drops it into the briefcase. marrow is startled, not expecting nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{nell.}
<A>__{she can only stare at him, eyes dead. marrow looks from her to the briefcase and back.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{were you looking for me?}
<A>__{nell can't answer. marrow comes over, unsettled.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{how are the tests going?}
<A>__{nell rises, staring, emotionless. betrayal just beginning to find a hold. she hands him her papers. marrow looks at nell, knows she's been in his briefcase. he picks it up, and with a final, sorry glance, exits.}
