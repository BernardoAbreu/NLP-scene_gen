<L>__{interior jim's classroom day}
<A>__{jim counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to himself.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{i was at the end of my count when it happened. i'd come up with exactly the same numbers as larry: tracy had won the election by a single vote, 256 to 257. i was about to announce my tally when...}
<A>__{jim looks up and sees tracy in the window, her face exploding with joy. she freezes. we move closer to jim in slow motion. what actually occurs in a split second is suspended in time}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{the sight of tracy at that moment affected me in a way i can't fully explain. part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face. looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl. but she wasn't sweet. and she wasn't innocent. she was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top. who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her? i had to stop her now.}
<A>__{tracy unfreezes and darts out of sight. jim glances at larry. larry is writing in a notebook. jim's hand creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of tracy votes. his fingers nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk. jim coughs as beneath his desk he crumples the ballots into a ball and drops them into the wastepaper basket.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{larry?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i think we've got a problem.}
