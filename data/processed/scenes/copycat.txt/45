<L>__{interior helen's living room late day}
<A>__{close up: early crime scene photos. we see for the first time the first two murder victims, so}
<B>__{we see the pattern helen describes and analyzes.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{the way he's posed the bodies... he's flaunting his power to do whatever he wants to her. this man... he probably seems perfectly normal. these murders are organized and planned.}
<A>__{we are now seeing the room: m.j. and ruben, helen at a table in her office laying out the pictures. helen picks out one picture from the rest...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{except for this one. you put that one in to test me.}
<A>__{m.j. nods, pleased with helen> insert: the picture. the victim's body is covered with bruises. but, unlike the others, her face has been covered.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{is it an ongoing case?}
<B>__{back to scene...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{for months... last october.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it was a lover or a husband. someone close. somebody who knew her and cared about her.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(glancing at ruben)}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he felt remorse. he covered her.}
<A>__{helen arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same. the positions are brutal... yet quite... artful. it's like... a signature. he's proud of his accomplishments. there are early picassos and late picassos, but you always recognize the hand. he wants us to recognize his hand. i've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{where are the stockings he strangled them with?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{how did you know they were stockings?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{i sent andy out on murder missions. for god's sake it's the boston strangler, alber desalvo. he used their own stockings to strangle them. tied in a bow knot.}
<A>__{she gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to pictures of desalvo's victims: they are identical...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{somebody is imitating his m.o. look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how desalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{the boston strangler, when was that...?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{in the sixties. he's dead stabbed to death in prison.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{why imitate a dead serial killer?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if you knew why, you might know where to look for him. i don't envy you this; he's not done he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. now, i've done what you asked me.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{work with me.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{it's good for you.}
<A>__{they are startled by his appearance! a little unsettling.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's good medicine.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{a little homeopathic cure for the willies.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{none of you know anything about it. now go. and andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i'm the only friend you've got, darling, and i don't intend to stop doing what i think is good for us.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{get out! all of you!}
<A>__{andy helps m.j. and ruben scoop up the files...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? this doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{let's get out of here...}
