<L>__{interior eve's day}
<D>__{chieko, mitsu and another of their friends are playing a pinball game that makes noises whenever the ball hits a wall. the young man in the milan jersey approaches chieko.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hello. neither chieko, nor her friends answer. the guy turns to look at one of his friends, who signals for him to insist.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{can i play with you? chieko, obviously, cannot hear him. she keeps playing. suddenly, mitsu notices the young man's presence and taps chieko on the shoulder. chieko turns around and is surprised. the young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{do you want to come have a drink? chieko gets frustrated; she cannot read his lips. he stops looking at his friends and awaits an answer, but all he sees is three silent girls staring at him stupefied. chieko talks to mitsu in sign language.}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{tell him i couldn't read his lips. the young man, upon seeing them communicate, is caught off guard. he turns around and walks toward his friends without saying a word.}
