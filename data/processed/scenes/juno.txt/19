<L>__{interior dancing elk school hallway day}
<A>__{juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with photos of leah and bleeker, plus a giant poster of iggy pop in his heyday. she grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. a few pages slip out. steve rendazo (the same asshole who harassed her as she walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.}
<C>__{steve rendazo}
<D>__{hey, your book fell apart!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{steve rendazo}
<D>__{it must have looked at your face. pwah!}
<A>__{he high fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{the funny thing is that steve rendazo secretly wants me. jocks like him always want freaky girls. girls with horn rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and goth makeup. girls who play the cello and wear converse all stars and want to be children's librarians when they grow up. oh yeah, jocks eat that shit up.}
<A>__{we see steve looking back at juno for a brief second with mixed feelings.}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{they just won't admit it, because they're supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like leah. who, incidentally, is into teachers.}
<A>__{we see leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle aged teacher, keith.}
<C>__{leah}
<P>__{(from a distance)}
<D>__{me too! i love woody allen!}
