<D>__{thanks. did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{back in wwi or wwii, one of the ww' s, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some nazi would be able to figure out where you were. then, well... it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. so three on a match is bad luck.}
