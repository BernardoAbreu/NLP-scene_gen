<C>__{ted}
<D>__{billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father. now there is a man who is very wise. he's called a judge. and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{why does he decide?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{because... well, that's what he does. he's a very powerful man.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{like a principal?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{bigger than a principal. the judge sits in robes in a big chair... the judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment.}
<P>__{(fake cheerful)}
<D>__{and i'm very lucky. because even though you'll live with your mom joanna i will get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.}

<C>__{billy}
<D>__{will you come and say good night to me every night?}
<A>__{suddenly ted can't stand it any longer.}
<C>__{ted}
