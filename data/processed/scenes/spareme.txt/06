<A>__{an american machine and foundry pin reset machine performs its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows a bowling ball through its journey. the "spare me!" theme music (similar to "balboa blue" by the marketts) swells. title: spare me! appears on the bowling ball. pins tumble across the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor, lifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating carousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the polished bowling alley. burn in principal player titles. titles appear on the pins. the ball trundles along the return trough straight into the lens.}
