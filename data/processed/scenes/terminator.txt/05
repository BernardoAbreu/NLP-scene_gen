<A>__{camera moves up as terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below. the school is perched at the edge of a pro montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem ing and glistening under a sullen sky. the night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of lightning, presaging a thunderstorm. terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the camera reaches full height.}
