<A>__{val knocks on the door to the mobile home.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hey, doctor, anybody here?}
<A>__{no answer. he opens the door and peers inside. behind him earl steps out of the half finished house and shrugs. nobody around. wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows. strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(spooked)}
<D>__{oh, man, i hate this shit.}
<A>__{they walk briskly to their horses. earl snatches heather's rifle from its saddle scabbard. val pulls out the winchester. earl tries to reassure himself.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{car's gone. we just missed them, that's all.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{then where's the goddamn conway twitty coming from?}
<A>__{they focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping constant watch in every direction. the ground here is all torn up like the sheep pen and the music is coming from underneath ! what the hell is going on? val scrapes at the dirt with his boot and finds the headlight of jim and megan's station wagon, still on, glaring up at him. he drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt, revealing more of the car's grille and hood and blood soaked dirt which sticks to his hand. he leaps away, frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{oh, man...oh, man...}
