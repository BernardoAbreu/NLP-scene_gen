<A>__{we hear easy listening music. lester, carolyn and jane are eating dinner by candlelight. red roses are bunched in a vase at the center of the table. nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody else's presence, until...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{no. no, we don't. as soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that i'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.}
<A>__{a long beat. lester suddenly turns to jane.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{so janie, how was school?}
<C>__{jane}

<D>__{no, dad. it was spec tac ular.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, you want to know how things went at my job today?}
<A>__{now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{they've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named brad, how perfect is that? and he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? no, no, that would be too... honest. and so they've asked us }
<P>__{(off her look)}

<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{well, what do you expect? you can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.}
<A>__{she gets up and heads toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{i mean, hello. you've barely even spoken to me for months.}
<A>__{she's gone. lester notices carolyn looking at him critically.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{oh, what, you're mother of the year? you treat her like an employee.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{lester is quiet, staring at his plate.}
<C>__{carolyn }
<P>__{(more authority)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{lester gets up and starts after jane, taking his plate with him.}
<C>__{lester}

<A>__{carolyn watches him go, irritated.}
