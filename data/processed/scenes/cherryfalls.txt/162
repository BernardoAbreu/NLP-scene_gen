<A>__{chaos has taken over the school. hardly anyone is still going to classes. kenny is standing in the hallway, looking for jody. he knows her class schedule and that she'll be passing by. jody appears from her classroom. she starts toward kenny, at first not noticing him. jody looks up and she sees him. she stops. she knows what he's there to talk to her about. he runs over to her.}

<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{everyone's grounded. there's a killer on the loose.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{no i'm really grounded. when i got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.}

<A>__{he kisses her full throttle. she's into it. she smiles at him as he darts off. she's happy but scared. she's got her guy back, at least for the moment.}
