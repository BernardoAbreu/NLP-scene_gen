<L>__{interior sixth container cargo hold night}
<A>__{cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. the survivors gather around fry's handlight. audrey tough little audrey has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...i think two more....}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{spirits. anything over 45 proof burns well.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{how many bottles?}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{not sure. ten?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{those umbrellas, the ones that mist. would they burn?}
<P>__{(reading his face)}
<D>__{if you got a receipt?}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{possibly.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{awright. so maybe we'll have enough light.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{enough for what?}
<A>__{now she challenges him to be the mind reader.}
<C>__{johns }
<D>__{oh, lady. if you're in your right mind, i pray you go insane.}
<C>__{fry}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{we can stick to the plan. if we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand cat won't run at night.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{we'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.}
<A>__{troubled faces. is it just our imagination? or is the light on the floor growing dimmer?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{you mean...tonight? with all those things still out there?}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{oh, sure. why not? sounds like a hoot.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{back it up. how long can this last? few minutes? couple hours?}
<A>__{no one knows for sure.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{i had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. that there would be...a lasting darkness.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{those suns gotta come back sometime . and if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{i'm sure that's what someone else said. locked inside that coring room.}
<A>__{a persuasive thought. eyes swing back to audrey.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{look, we gotta think about everyone now the kid especially. how scared is she gonna be out there?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{smoke screen for what?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{for your own fear.}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{hey. why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve mass suicide?}
<A>__{two seconds pass.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{how much you weigh, johns?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{what the hell's it matter?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{79 kilos.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan.}
<A>__{he makes a move for her. riddick blocks. johns' shotgun bumps the underside of riddick's chin.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{think about that reward, johns.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{i'm willing to take a cut in pay.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{how 'bout a cut in your gut?}
<A>__{johns looks down. camera drops to reveal the shiv riddick holds, poised for evisceration.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{oh, trash baby, you're gonna regret this.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{please...this solves nothing...please....}
<A>__{johns backs off first. the light grows dimmer.}
<C>__{fry}
<P>__{(to audrey)}
<D>__{they're afraid of our light. that means we don't have to be so afraid of them.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{and you're certain you can find the way back? even in the dark?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{no, i'm not. but he can.}
<A>__{she's pointing, of course, to riddick.}
