<A>__{ichabod makes notations in a ledger book.}
<C>__{katrina }
<D>__{you will dream.}
<A>__{katrina strolls in, sits on the bed. ichabod is nervous.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{did they tell? it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone. according to the elders, an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you are horribly old fashioned, aren't you?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{feel free to form your own opinion.}
<P>__{(facing his ledger)}
<D>__{though it appears you already have.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{well, i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt, but it seems i've made matters worse.}
<P>__{(getting up to go)}
<D>__{i will leave you to your business.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{excuse me... i should apologize. i, um... i... have no great love of...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{other people?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{small talk.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{it might have been more. might have been positively grand talk.}
<A>__{ichabod offers his chair, backing away. seeing it is the only one, he remains standing. katrina sits.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{my suitor?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the massive fellow... brom. for someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{he has proposed to me twice.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{which may explain his temperament. to have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.}
<A>__{katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i've read a great deal about your new york city. do be a dear and tell me all about it. sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{extra ordinary, yes. but first, you tell me about the headless horseman.}
