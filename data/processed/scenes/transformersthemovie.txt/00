<A>__{a small planet glows in the light of its sun. suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind the planet... then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction. almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.}

<A>__{at first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. then, pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons. this is the autobot staging ground for an assault on cybertron. dolly through the complex until we arrive at a command center where several autobots peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on cybertron.}
