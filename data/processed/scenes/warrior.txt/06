<D>__{yeah? must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.}

<A>__{tommy shrugs. takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos. he takes them in. framed photo of: 12 year old tommy, in a wrestling uniform and holding a huge trophy, standing next to a younger paddy, who wears a towel over his shoulder, circa 1992. framed photo of: young paddy and a lovely, thin woman dancing awkwardly at a wedding reception, circa 1974. framed photo of: the same woman, shielding her eyes from the sun, standing next to two young boys, aged 4 and 6, at the kennywood amusement park, circa 1984. framed photo of: 8 year old tommy, a younger paddy, and a 10 year old boy standing in front of a blast furnace wearing hard hats circa 1988. tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a mall photography studio, of a man and woman (late 20s) posing with a young girl (2). the man looks like the second boy in the other photos. his brother brendan.}

<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{so you found god, huh? that's awesome. mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. i guess jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. who knew?}

<D>__{that's too bad. you could've gotten some good details.}

<A>__{paddy chokes up. tommy looks at him. closes his eyes.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{i think i liked you better when you were a drunk.}
<A>__{an overwhelmed paddy sips his coffee and looks at tommy, who is fading. the pills are kicking in. he tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out. paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. he watches his son. relieved and heartbroken at the same time.}
