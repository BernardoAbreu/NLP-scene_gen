<L>__{interior dad's office early evening}
<A>__{kale sits in the darkness at dad's desk. he's on the phone, pressing his other finger to his ear, trying to drown out the noise emanating from ashley's party next door. kale, on phone, gets ronnie's voice mail.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(phone filter)}
<D>__{this is ronnie, leave a message.}
<A>__{kale slams the phone down, sits there a beat. jump cut: the white pages thwump onto the desk. jump cut: kale on the phone:}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm calling about the jeep cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug it's ready? listen, did they have to replace the whole tire they patched it? is there any way to tell if it was slashed or but a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? i mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes.}
<P>__{(beat as kale listens)}
<D>__{ yeah, i guess anything's possible.}
<A>__{a roar of laughter o.s. makes kale jump from his chair. he grabs the binoculars, heads to the window. binocular pov kale scans the crowd until he finds ashley, talking with a group of partygoers. she pretends to listen to one of the guy's stories as she furtively glances toward kale's window. but it's quick. we can't be a hundred percent sure if it was on purpose.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{wait, what was that? you think i'm watching? well, i'm not... nope, i am minding my own business...}
<A>__{binocular pov ashley excuses herself from the group and approaches the drink and food table where minnie tyco (a.k.a. "skinny psycho") is standing, nitpicking over her snack choices. ashley hugs her then taps the cute guy next to her on the shoulder. the guy turns around. ashley mouths "oh my god" like he's some long lost lover. ashley hugs the surprised guy who wastes no time in hugging her back.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{you think i'm buying that?}
<A>__{kale keeps watching.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{i'm not biting }
<A>__{binocular pov ashley glances up in kale's direction again it's more obvious this time as she keeps hugging the guy.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{kale tosses the binoculars, heads out.}
