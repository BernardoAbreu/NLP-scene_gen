<L>__{interior. the woman's room}
<A>__{it is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven dollars a week. it is not particularly unkempt or tarty. there is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on an end table. there is a studio couch with a neat spread and throw pillows on it. the woman stands expressionlessly in front of the old chest of drawers. she has kicked off one shoe and she is now kicking off the other. she starts to say something:}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{listen, i don't want you to think i don't have a job. i got a job. i work.}
<A>__{she stops abruptly as arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, on a straight back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and moves toward the door.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{arnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and he clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and wretched. his hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary gesture, and he quickly clenches his fist. beads of sweat are on his forehead.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{are you afraid of me?}
<A>__{arnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens the door and steps out into the landing. the woman, beginning to get angry, follows him.}
