<L>__{interior hilton night}
<A>__{shane walks down the hall to his room. he enters.}
<L>__{interior shane's room night}
<A>__{he walks in and closes the door. when he turns around, eddie martel, ex washington redskin quarterback, is sitting on shane's bed. two defensive linemen types stand by the window.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{this is a visit.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{a visit. who let you in?}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{i used to nail one of the housekeepers.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{lucky girl.}
<C>__{martel}
<P>__{(pointing to the linemen)}
<D>__{you know who these guys are, don't you?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{dallas cowboys. howdy.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{you'll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{who, me? not much. but these boys wanted a little head start on you.}
<A>__{there's a beat and then shane suddenly bolts for the door. but the two linemen grab and hold him.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'm flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{it can be a game of luck. and under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and o. especially against the dallas cowboys. it's just not good for the game.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{is the union behind this 'visit'?}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{i can't really say, shane. by the way, have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs?}
<A>__{he kicks shane viciously in the side. shane screams.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{the pain makes it damn near impossible.}
<A>__{the linemen drops shane on the floor.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{and one other thing: i want you to stay away from annabelle.}
<A>__{shane is gasping on the floor.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{the sad fact is she won't give me the time of day. but you can't have everything i want. i can't let that happen. so, you gotta stop seeing her. just on principle.}
<A>__{martel viciously kicks shane again. shane screams.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{let me hear you say it.}
<A>__{shane is trying to get his breath.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{come on. you can do it.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(barely visible)}
<D>__{i won't go out with her anymore.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(to the linemen)}
<D>__{gentlemen?}
<P>__{(to shane)}
<D>__{hey, have a great game!}
<A>__{they move toward the door.}
