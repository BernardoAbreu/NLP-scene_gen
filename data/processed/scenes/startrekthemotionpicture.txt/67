<A>__{kirk seeming to collect his thoughts now he gives decker a look, uses the intercom himself:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{warp drive as soon as possible, mr. scott.}
<C>__{scott's intercom voice}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{captain, it was our anti matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. it will happen again if we don't correct it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that object out there is less than two days from earth, mister scott. we've got to intercept while it still is out there!}
<C>__{scott's intercom voice}
<P>__{(near annoyed)}
<D>__{aye, we understand that sir! we're doing our best.}
<A>__{as kirk flips off the intercom, rises determinedly, faces decker:}

<D>__{you have the conn, mr. sulu. mccoy}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{mind if i tag along?}

<D>__{lieutenant ilia...?}
<C>__{ilia}
<P>__{(a beat; then quickly)}
<D>__{confirmed, mr. sulu. confirmed.}
<A>__{and she punches in some equations, then again peers up at the doors where she last saw decker. she is very concerned.}
