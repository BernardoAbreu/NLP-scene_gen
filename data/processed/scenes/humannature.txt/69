<A>__{a woman under a hair drier reads a book intently. we see the first sentence of the chapter: "last night i almost died on this mountain top." we hear lila's dramatic reading competing with the very loud sound of the hair drier.}

<A>__{there is a violent, violent storm. the hair drier drone has turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets and wind howling at fifty miles an hour. branches crack. lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket.}

<D>__{i knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. it turned the sky a queer shade of green. a green that said "watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell." i could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. part of the nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it.}
<A>__{lightning hits a tree nearby. it falls with a smack practically on top of lila. she screams, then defiantly stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. the wind and rain whip her hair around her head. she laughs with amazing gusto and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon.}
