<L>__{int: apartment adjacent to lilly's continuing}
<A>__{lilly's pov crashing through the apartment and reaching the window, pulling it open to see...}
<L>__{ext: lilly's apartment, rear continuing}
<A>__{...lilly's pov of the city below. we see her search with her eyes, and then she sees it. cut to lilly's pov, closer, looking down on edgar running over a roof. cut to edgar running towards us as we track back, then he launches himself... cut to low angle, edgar jumping from above us, to land almost on the camera, stopping himself by grabbing iron piping protruding from the side of the building. edgar turns, smiles, thinking he's escaped; then shock comes across his face. cut to edgar's pov as silus flies through the air and crashes straight into the camera. silus' hands go straight for edgar's throat, stopping edgar from falling. the two brothers eyes lock.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you saved me...}
<A>__{then edgar's smile. he pushes off the wall with his legs, sending both of them tumbling over the railing. we see them fall, silus hitting a railing which sends him spinning out of control, whilst edgar manages to clasp onto it. cut to silus' pov, tumbling wildly out of control, heading for the ground, finally coming to a jarring stop, the view of the alleyway upside down. we now reveal silus, only just conscious, caught in wire netting, hanging upside down in the alleyway. and there, landing, is edgar, poised, watching. edgar slowly approaches so that he is near. he bends down to silus.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{when will you admit it. you're just like me.}
<A>__{edgar's nose is bleeding. he dabs some on his fingers, then raises his hand to silus.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{maybe you need some encouragement.}
<A>__{he brings the dripping blood closer to silus, closer... then an explosion; the sound of bullets whistling through the air. then edgar is gone. cut to lilly and jones entering the alleyway to find silus still hanging from the railing.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(to jones)}
<D>__{get him down.}
<A>__{lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for edgar.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{lilly, wait! damn you. lilly!}
<A>__{she turns and gives him a final quick look.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{if he escapes then steph is dead. just follow me when you can, hurry!}
<A>__{cut to lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway; water plops and dribbles from leaking pipes. she swings her gun towards movement; water crashing out of a pipe. lilly's shaking, terrified, but she keeps on going. and then another sound and she swings her gun to find edgar, standing in the shadows, waiting.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{the little policewoman.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{don't move!}
<A>__{edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires; the bullet going through the flesh of edgar's arm; his arm now smoking.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i said don't move. where is she, where's the girl?}
<A>__{edgar can only smile.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{oh, i've killed her already. essentially.}
<A>__{then he moves, she fires, but he's too fast, spinning, diving, in an instant he has the gun, twisting it and lilly's arm behind her back. she fires, once, twice, the bullets and smoke rising up from edgar's side. he twists harder, the gun then falling to the ground. edgar is now behind her. he moves his face close to hers.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{has he tasted you yet, little policewoman?}
<A>__{lilly tries to twist out of his grasp.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's just the same as me, you know it, you can feel it too.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{he's nothing like you.}
<A>__{edgar's face twists into a smile.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{we will see. you will be my tool.}
