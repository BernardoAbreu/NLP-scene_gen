<A>__{quint at ease in his chair, brody near him, practicing tying knots. the line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both men watch. then the line whizzes off the reel. brody jumps up. hooper springs to the deck. quint puts his hand on the drag and addresses the situation softly.}

<D>__{ he'll gulp it down now...}

<D>__{wet my reel, quick!}
<A>__{brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. brody pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now. hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes direction.}

<P>__{(suddenly to brody)}
<D>__{grab onto this!}
<A>__{before he realizes what's happening, brody is clumsily clutching at the big rod, appalled. quint skips away for a flying gaff. he picks one, turns... that's when the leader lashes free, sending hooper crashing backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at brody's forehead, drawing blood. quint snatches up the rod and reels in. the wires have been bitten through.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{a marlin, or a stingray. huh. don't ever tell me my business again. get back up on the bridge.}

<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(still looking)}
<D>__{at least you handle the boat all right. stop. here... cut the engine.}
<A>__{hooper cuts the engines as quint swings nimbly down. he stands stock still on the main deck, motioning brody to be silent. then picking up the newly rigged rod, quint softshoes it over to the chair. about to sit down, he freezes. close quint looking hard at something. close brody staring, eyes widening. close hooper moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.}
<B>__{their combined point of view}
<A>__{we see the shark. first the fin... then the head and upper jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. it finally submerges, its tail giving a final slap.}

<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what do we do? get some help? radio in?}
<A>__{quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin to assemble something inside it. brody is alone on the deck with hooper.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{how're we gonna handle this?}
<A>__{hooper is contained in his own excitement. he has finally come up with what he was looking for an expensive nikon through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. he is talking half to himself as he fine tunes the range finder and focus. he is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional boil.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(very, very high)}
<D>__{there's a formula! girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this! divide by 2000... three tons!}

<B>__{close on quint in the pilot house}
<A>__{he is assembling the greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. past him, on the deck, we can still see hooper. as quint is working with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.}

<D>__{damn it! i need something in the foreground to give it some scale. martin! stand here! no, to your left!}
<A>__{he is positioning martin frantically, trying to include brody, the shark, and the orca in the same frame. quint finishes with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive cartridge into the breech. he empties the box of cartridges onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow pulpit.}
<B>__{on deck}
<A>__{quint appears with the harpoon gun. he throws one end of the line to hooper.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{here. rig this to the forward keg up there.}

<P>__{(to brody)}

<A>__{quint moves up toward the bow, brody goes up to the flying bridge to take the wheel, hooper starts for the foredeck, but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he desperately hunts for something.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{hurry up, rig the line!}
<B>__{angle on hooper}
<A>__{he finds what he's looking for. a small, powerful strobe unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. he triggers it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in the sun. hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the bow.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{come to port. watch my hand. steady now...}
<A>__{he guides brody with hand signals. brody tries urgently to get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat with its throbbing diesels on the course that quint is indicating.}

<D>__{get clear, damn you!}
<A>__{the shark is in position, hooper shouts, a moment too late.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{clear!}

<D>__{jesus h. christ on a crutch!}
<A>__{insert coiled rope and barrel the rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, hooper jumps back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the line rigged to the harpoon. it bounds forward and into the sea, past quint, who is already reloading, mounting another steel shaft. in the distance, the barrel bobs and skips violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless moves. the foredeck quint}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{now you've done it, you piss ant. stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear. let the bastard fight the keg for a while. he can't stay down with that on.}
<A>__{hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to take the helm from brody. the flying bridge, brody and hooper hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.}

<B>__{from the flying bridge}
<A>__{hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. quint has turned his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else. as quint folds his arms and stares at hooper, we realize the sun is going down, and it's getting dark.}
