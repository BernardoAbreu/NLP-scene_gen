<L>__{exterior farmhouse day}
<A>__{phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from his escape from jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers into the open window. the keys dangle when his small hand touches them. phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell mell to the passenger window of the impala.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{it's got keys and a radio. i checked.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{good man.}
<A>__{phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{can we stop at a fillin' station.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{number one.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{this here's nature, phillip. pee in the ditch.}
<A>__{phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while butch steps out of the impala, tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the ford. the farmer stops his tractor and notices butch and phillip. phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing relief. butch slides into the ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the key. the engine grumbles and dies. the farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he realizes what's happening. phillip finally starts to pee. butch cranks again and again but the ford is flooded.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{start, you sonofabitch!}
<A>__{the farmer runs faster, comes closer...}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{hey, that's my car! hey!!!}
<A>__{butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the engine finally starts. he throws it into reverse and peels out backwards into the road beside the ditch where phillip continues to relieve himself.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{get in the car, phillip!}
<A>__{the farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them madder than a wet hen. phillip tries to hurry but the rc continues to run through him.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{phillip! get in the car!}
<A>__{phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. he leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment butch steps on the gas and the farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes.}
