<A>__{truman finds himself on a small metal landing. a steel ladder rises above him to the height of "sky", the soundstage roof, so high as to be barely visible. the rungs also continue downward, the depth of the "ocean bed", to a studio floor far below. truman turns and looks back through the door he has just entered. unsecured, the santa maria is beginning to drift away. the sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an enormous tank. the sky, a massive cyclorama. new york city, an elaborate set. and it is all housed within an impossibly large soundstage. truman makes no effort to save the boat. he shuts the door to his world. a sign on the back of the door reads, "closed set. no unauthorized access." gradually he becomes aware of another strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage. all around him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating switched on by an automatic timer. (the light fixtures match the one that almost struck truman's car at the beginning of the film.) by artificial starlight, truman begins his long descent of the step ladder. below, a studio tram makes its way along the soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.}
