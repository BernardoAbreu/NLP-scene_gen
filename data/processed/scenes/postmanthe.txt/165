<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{a pair of boots are walking through the water. it's the postman. he turns over a body in the water. it wears a homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his arm. it's a young face, one we haven't seen before. he looks up to abby on a ridge.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't know him. do you?}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{where do you think he came from?}
<A>__{puzzled, the postman shakes his head. he gently releases the body. the current takes it and they watch as it continues on its way to postal valhalla.}
