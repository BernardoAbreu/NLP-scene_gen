<L>__{interior catacombs insect chamber}
<A>__{milburn and fifield have bunked down in a new chamber: they slouch against a wall. milburn sweeps the room with his headlamp. stoops to lift something into the light.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{look at this!}
<A>__{a centipede, three feet long and thick as man's thumb. its hard shell is gray. it has a hammer head like a shark.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{jesus! put it down!}
<A>__{he leaps back, wild eyed. milburn laughs at him. lets the eyeless centipede wind its segmented body around his space suited arm. in the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. changes quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a mouth. milburn doesn't notice this development.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{relax. your suit's bug proof. hell, it's bulletproof.}
<A>__{the centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body moving in fluid waves. the blind head quests between his fingers. milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.}
<C>__{milburn }
<D>__{that's enough.}
<A>__{he tries to pull it off. the centipede locks its segments together and digs in with its body. it might as well be made of iron.}
<C>__{milburn }
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{get it off! it's crushing me!}
<A>__{fifield pulls out a utility knife. cuts into the centipede's body behind its head. a gout of greed acid spills over milburn's glove. smoke rises as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material. milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.}
<C>__{milburn }
<D>__{ahh! help me! christ!}
<A>__{the centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove. crawls upward into milburn's suit toward his head.}
