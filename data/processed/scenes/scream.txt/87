<A>__{kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time ago. he finds a bag of cheetos and chows down when he hears screaming from outside. he peers out the window to see the last of the party kids pile into two cars and race off down the road. he chews a cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.}
<L>__{interior bedroom minutes later}
<A>__{the sex is over...and both sid and billy are dressing respectively. that post sex awkwardness. sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her face. she turns to billy who sits on the floor, putting on his shoes.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{who did you call?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{when you're arrested you're allowed one phone call? who did you call?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i called my dad.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, sheriff burke called your dad. i saw him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah...and when i called no one answered.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you don't still think it was me?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. using your one phone call to call me so i wouldn't think it was you.}
<A>__{billy stands up.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what do i have to do to prove to you i'm not a killer?}
<A>__{he makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant, from the open balcony doors comes...}
<B>__{the ghost figure}
<A>__{sidney sees the figure immedietely, screaming. billy tries to calm her, oblivious to the advancing ghost.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{billywatchout!!!!}
<A>__{billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air. it strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the air. on sidney as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife is thrust in and out of billy who tries hard to put up a fight..but it's useless...he never had a chance. his body falls to the floor..lifeless.}
<B>__{angle on ghost}
<A>__{as he watches billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly turning his attention to... sidney who stands, numb...scared to death. and only when the ghost takes a step forward does sidney break. she takes off like a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.}
