<L>__{interior gammy bird newsroom day}
<A>__{a newsroom. makes the mockingburg record look like the washington post. only two employees at their vintage desks. card points as he bellows...}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{now, there's billy pretty. he's something of a landmark and an old fish dog.}
<A>__{billy pretty is wizened and wiry, pushing 70. a tiny, energetic creature with well weathered hide, watering crystal blue eyes, and a slanted smile. he waves a bony hand.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{billy does the home news page. poems, baby photos, household tips, and a gossip column, under the byline of junior sugg, that is pretty much straight libel.}
<A>__{billy nods. that pretty much covers it.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{in short. he writes the only stuff anybody actually reads.}
<A>__{little salute from the managing editor. if card likes anybody, he likes billy. and he doesn't.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{now this miserable ugly brit, is b. beaufield nutbeem. imagines he's the foreign news chief. steals every story off that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in limey prose.}
<C>__{nutbeem }
<D>__{which bloody card rewrites in a mystical tongue most charitably referenced as an unacquireable taste.}
<A>__{nutbeem is 50 and gangly. buttery hair swept behind ample ears. a thin moustache, a bounteous bowtie, a ratty pullover. he opens a file folder. gives quoyle a piercing, meaningful glance.}
<C>__{nutbeem}
<D>__{mine: 'burmese sawmill owners and the rangoon development corporation met in tokyo tuesday to consider a joint approach to marketing tropical hardwoods.'}

<A>__{a stunned. silence.}

<C>__{nutbeem}
<D>__{if misspelled.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{now what's funnier, quoyle? my writing style, or the fantasy that any newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first pia...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{how'd the meeting go? did they agree on a joint marketing approach?}
<A>__{the beginning. of a beautiful friendship.}
<C>__{nutbeem }
<D>__{still in progress, old bean. one can only hope.}
<A>__{card, who likes no one. doesn't like quoyle, too.}
<C>__{card}
<D>__{there's your miserable desk, quoyle. we've got no idea what yer s'posed to do. but mr. jack buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all. til then...}
<A>__{and he turns away. through the swinging door. slam. quiet. except for nutbeem's chuckle.}
