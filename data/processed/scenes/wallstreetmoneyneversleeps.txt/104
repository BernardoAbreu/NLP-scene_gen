<L>__{interior central park dusk}
<A>__{sheep's meadow... painted in the soft light of sunset. fresh off his morning run, gordon wears a sweat suit and works a vitamin water. jacob approaches in his suit.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he wants to close the fund... he wants to ride off into the fucking sunset...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{okay...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, it's not okay... because we're so fucking close... and he's going to walk with six hundred million dollars and that's unacceptable.}
<A>__{and gordon sighs in defeat...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i don't know what to tell you, pal. you wanted to make him bleed, i wanted my daughter back...}
<A>__{as he walks...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{... looks like life brings disappointment to us all.}
<A>__{and jacob... as he matches gordon's stride... in a complete state.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what happened to slaughtering men, gordon? what happened to turning them into penny ante brokers in poughkeepsie?}
<A>__{gordon stops walking.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{look at you. this can't possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with.}
<A>__{jacob turns away.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i want to finish the job.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{because nobody gave a shit about me before andrew zabel came along. because he didn't deserve what he got.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{the universe is an efficient market, kid... we all get what we deserve.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{did you?}
<A>__{now it's gordon who looks away.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i know you cared about him... and i know how that motivates. but jacob... he wasn't such a sainterior}
<A>__{and with that, gordon gekko heads on his way...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<A>__{jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm sorry she doesn't want anything to do with you, gordon i'm sorry she doesn't love you!}
<A>__{gordon stops walking. turns...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{okay jake... you want to know.}
<A>__{jacob sharply nods.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{did you ever think about it? i mean really think about it? how someone could make money year after year... even through bear markets?}
<A>__{jacob just stands there... listening...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{on november 15th, 1903 an italian man arrived aboard the s.s. vancouver in boston. he had two dollars and fifty cents to his name. yet just a few years later he was millionaire. you wanna know how? he had invented a scheme... it was quite simple actually.}
<A>__{and jacob now steps forward... piecing it together...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{he would get people to invest with him by offering larger than normal returns then pay the old investors with the new investors money. as long as there was fresh money, he could keep going. do you know what his name was, jacob? it was charles...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{charles ponzi.}
<B>__{flash to an old brick building}
<A>__{"jenkov foundation for brain research" above the door... researchers in lab coats coming in and out of it.}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) research facilities...}
<B>__{then to a college campus}
<A>__{students walking the quad... wearing backpacks and socializing...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) and scholarships...}
<B>__{then to a bike path}
<A>__{somewhere in florida. a couple in their 70s enjoying a beautiful day... riding bicycles side by side...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) and retirees...}
<B>__{and right back to central park}
<A>__{gordon steps forward...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{all of them went to bed thinking they were perfectly fine... are going to wake up to find they're completely wiped out...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i'm not, son. i wish i were.}
<A>__{jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{see jacob, you knew how to get that out of me. by playing me off of what i really want... my daughter back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so you need get bretton back in the game... play him off of what he really wants.}
<A>__{and off jacob's reaction...}
