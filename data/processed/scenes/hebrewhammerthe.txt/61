<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the hammer and esther scope out the area. the hammer is disguised terribly, consisting of a baseball hat on top of his shtreml, and a jesus fish t shirt worn over his black suit. esther's visibly nervous.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{any sign of santa?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{he must be behind that curtain. relax. we're undercover. we need to give off the appearance of calm. you see esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. act as a gentile would.}
<A>__{the two pass a samples booth. the free samples woman solicits the hammer.}
<C>__{samples woman}
<D>__{could i interest you in a free sample bacon cheeseburger?}
<A>__{we get a cu of the burger followed by a cu of the hammer. he's mortified, but he pulls it together.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{while i thank you, gentile friend, for your generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack, i sadly have to decline for i stuffed myself full of meat and milk product at a prior lunch engagement.}
<A>__{the sample woman looks at him strangely as the hammer and esther walk on.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{you're good.}
<A>__{the two take their place at the end of the line in to see santa. tony performs the two fingered whistle.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{can i have everyone's attention please. in fifteen minutes, santa's gonna have to leave.}
<A>__{the kids all vocalize their disappointment.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{ah, don't be like that kids. we gotta lot work to do if we're gonna get all those presents out in time.}
<A>__{the kids aren't buying it. more boos and protests of disapproval.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{hey! hey! you want shitty ass presents for christmas? you want barbies with heads screwed on backwards? you want remote control cars without the batteries included. then be my fucking guest!}
<A>__{tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to take his place in front of the velvet ropes. esther surveys their place in line. it's about fifteen deep.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{what are we going to do? we're at least an hour from the front.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{c'mon follow me.}
<A>__{the two make their way up to the front of the line. they pass a man who looks eerily like ex rapping god, mc hammer.}
<C>__{esther}
<P>__{(to hammer)}
<D>__{is that...? no, couldn't be.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{hey, hey! not so fast.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{we have to get through. it's an emergency.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{sorry pal, you're gonna have to wait in line just like all the other parents.}
<A>__{esther adjusts her bust. she's incredibly sexy in her tight fitting denim jacket. she smiles flirtatiously at the elves.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{we're so sorry to have to cut, but our beautiful gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line.}
<A>__{she puts her hand on tony's bicep and smiles once again.}
<C>__{esther }
<D>__{it would mean so much to paul and i if you'd let us through to see santa.}
<A>__{tony is putty in her hands.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well...umm, when you put it that way. sure go on through.}
<A>__{tony unhinges the rope, and the two pass. the hammer leans over to esther.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{you're good!}
