<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{we can't get out of here without them!}
<A>__{he steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick, finally coming up with the glasses. he shakes them free of insects and clambers out to join christine, who's gasping and brushing the bugs off of her. schuyler puts on the glasses and holds up a bug.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{they're rubber. hold onto me, i will get us out of here.}
