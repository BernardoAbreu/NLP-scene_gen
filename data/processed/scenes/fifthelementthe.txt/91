<D>__{i'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.}
<A>__{his eyes fall on an old blanket.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{here let me wrap you up.}
<A>__{korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back. leeloo warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder. korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{..it's funny. i've met you twice today and you've ended up in my arms both times.}
<A>__{leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far. she recovers, looking embarrassed too.}
<C>__{leeloo}
<P>__{(nicely)}
<D>__{valo massa... chacha hamas.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{uh..you're welcome.}
<A>__{the intimacy makes him nervous. he looks for a diversion.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{coffee! that's what you need! a nice, hot cup of coffee!}
<A>__{he pushes a button on the coffee machine.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{with some honey! you'll see, honey's great!...}
<A>__{korben rummages through the drawer. leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to quite understand everything that is going on.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{a hot cup of coffee... with honey...}
<A>__{he rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous. leeloo smiles and begins to look around. she opens a drawer and comes upon..}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{i've got this great honey somewhere. you know about honey? there used to be these little animals who made it with antenna...}
<A>__{..pictures of major korben dallas war hero.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{..and these other animals who ate it.. one were bees the other were bears..}
<A>__{she looks back to the man fumbling for honey.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i forget which ate it and which made it but..}
<A>__{and she smiles.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{here it is!}
<A>__{korben holds up the jar of honey.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{taste this...}
<A>__{leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{it... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?}
<A>__{she savors the honey, slowly; sensually. her lips shine with honey. her eyes narrow with pleasure. korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth attracted to a flame. he begins to lose control, which makes him nervous. an indistinct sound comes from the wall. but korben is so entranced with the sight of leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until it becomes quite a racket.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you hear that?}
<C>__{leeloo}
<P>__{(licking)}
<D>__{cornelius..}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{korben pushes the button on the wall. the bed pops out, fully made, with cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i'm really sorry.. let me help you..}
<A>__{korben begins to pull at the covers when..}
<C>__{leeloo}
<D>__{achta ge lumitai de matala..}
<A>__{korben turns..}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he turns to leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. his breath is taken away by the sight of her perfect body. cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp. korben drops to the floor.}
<C>__{leeloo}
<P>__{(displeased)}
<D>__{vano da, mechteba?! soun domo kala chon hammas!}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{no, i'm not proud of myself... but we don't have the luxury of choice.}
