<L>__{exterior stephanie's kitchen continuous}
<A>__{miles wanders in to find maya squatting in front of a little temperature controlled wine storage unit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she got anything good?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh, yeah. steph's way into pinots and syrahs.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey, steph? you sure we can open anything? anything we want?}
<C>__{stephanie }
<D>__{anything but the jayer richebourg!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she has a richebourg? mon dieu. i have completely underestimated stephanie.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{who do you think you're dealing with here?}
<A>__{maya slips out a bottle of eschevaux.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{how about this?}
<A>__{miles nods vigorously. maya looks back and forth between miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. then she slides it back in.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{nope. i don't think we know each other well enough.}
<P>__{(picking out another bottle)}
<D>__{i'd say this guy's more our speed.}
<A>__{they rise, and miles glances at the andrew murray syrah and, raising his eyebrows, agrees. maya begins opening it.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so what gems do you have in your collection?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not much of a collection really. i haven't had the wallet for that, so i sort of live bottle to bottle. but i've got a couple things i'm saving. i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{you've got a '61 cheval blanc that's just sitting there? go get it.}
<P>__{(pushing him, playfully stern)}
<D>__{right now. hurry up...}
<A>__{miles laughs, fights back a bit.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? at least that's what i've read.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{it might be too late already. what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. special occasion. with the right person. it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.}
<A>__{understanding, maya considers her response.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{the day you open a '61 cheval blanc, that's the special occasion.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{how long have you been into wine?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i started to get serious about seven years ago.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what was the bottle that did it?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{eighty eight sassicaia.}
<A>__{miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. maya pours, and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{wow. we gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. really good. how about you?}
<C>__{maya}
<P>__{(tastes again)}
<D>__{i think they overdid it a bit. too much alcohol. overwhelms the fruit.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(tasting again, impressed)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd say you're right on the money.}
<A>__{then miles absently scans the refrigerator door and spots a photo of stephanie holding a little girl.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is this stephanie's kid? sure is cute.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, siena's a sweetie.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is she sleeping or...?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{she's with her grandmother. she's with steph's mom. she spends a lot of time over there. steph's... well, she's stephanie.}
<A>__{jack's voice over voice from the other room...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{"and now for a low, low 4.8% apr..."}
<A>__{...is followed by peals of laughter.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{you got kids?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{who me? nah, i'd just fuck them up. that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, same here.}
<A>__{maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, thinking about something else.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{let's go in there.}
<A>__{maya takes the bottle, and they wander into }
