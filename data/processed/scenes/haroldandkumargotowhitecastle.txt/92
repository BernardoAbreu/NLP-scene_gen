<L>__{exterior gas station convenience store}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk back towards their car...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar you okay?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{yeah, i just hate those dicks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fuck it. at least now we know where we're going. i'm so friggin' hungry...}
<A>__{suddenly, we hear a car engine start. harold and kumar stop walking and look over at kumar's car. they see neil in the driver's seat, turning the key. they watch as he puts the car into drive, hits the gas, and takes off, driving through a sign, and getting on the road... harold and kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the distance. eventually, harold breaks the silence...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{did doogie howser just steal my fucking car?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i think he did.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{fuck!!!!!!}
<P>__{(to kumar)}
<D>__{you! you had to pick up a hitchhiker!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{rold, calm down!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i figured that neil patrick harris was a trustworthy guy. how was i supposed to know that he'd fuck us over?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{this is all your fault! this whole fucking night! you know i leased that car! they're gonna make me pay for it!}
<A>__{harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm going to call the police! i don't want to talk to you anymore!}
<A>__{harold is about to walk in, when he sees cole wind up and throw a hostess like snowball right in the cashier's face. "extremes" all around!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{there's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.}
<A>__{harold turns around and walks back towards the street. kumar walks with him, keeping his distance. they reach the street. on the other side, he sees an orange "don't walk" sign lit up. harold presses the "walk" button on the post next to him.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{so after you talk to the cops we're still going to white castle, right?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm not speaking to you.}
<A>__{harold waits for the "don't walk" sign to change. it doesn't. he starts pressing the "walk" button repeatedly.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. the computer responds to the first press. every press after that is extraneous.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{thank you, mr. wizard.}
<A>__{harold waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{jesus christ! when are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency?}
<A>__{the "don't walk" sign still won't change. kumar looks to the left and then to the right. the street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. just walk across.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{it'll change in a second.}
<A>__{they stand there for another ten seconds. it doesn't change.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{come on, there's not a car in sight!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{alright fine. you want me to cross? i will cross. just leave me alone!}
<A>__{harold starts walking angrily across the street.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{finally.}
<A>__{before kumar has a chance to follow, a police car from out of}
<B>__{nowhere flashes its lights and stops harold dead in his tracks.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{harold walks back over to kumar, clearly upset within him, as officer palumbo (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(looking at cop's name tag)}
<D>__{good evening. is there a problem, officer...palumbo?}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{is there a problem? ever hear of jaywalking?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{yes. yes i have. i'm so sorry. i promise i will never do it again.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{yeah, like i give a fuck. i'm writing you up a ticket.}
<A>__{officer palumbo begins writing a ticket. kumar walks over, flabbergasted...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{a ticket?! are you serious?}
<A>__{harold motions kumar to "shut the fuck up!"}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<P>__{(to kumar, unthreatened)}
<D>__{who the fuck are you, shitwad?}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(stepping in front of kumar)}
<D>__{let me apologize for my friend. i promise i will pay the fine. but actually, i'm glad you're here. you know the tv show doogie howser, m.d? you see, doogie howser just stole my car and...}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{pipe down and give me your id.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to officer palumbo)}
<D>__{wait. hold on.}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{how can you give him a ticket for jaywalking? i mean, look at this street! he wasn't causing traffic or anything!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar, shut up...}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<P>__{(to kumar)}
<D>__{yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{bust my ass?!}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{yeah, koo mar. bust your ass.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{what's with that name koo mar with like three o's and shit. what happened to good old fashioned american names like dave, jim...}
<A>__{harold points to his id.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{harold.}
<A>__{harold is starting to pacify palumbo.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{yes. harold. that's a great name. you should be proud of that name, son.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{officer palumbo hands harold his ticket and begins to walk away.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{as you were, ladies.}
<A>__{kumar grabs the ticket from harold and looks at it.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{220 dollars!? are you crazy?}
<A>__{palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar, i swear to god, if you don't...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to officer palumbo)}
<D>__{no, no, no. i understand what's going on.}
<A>__{harold steps in front of kumar and puts his arms up to block him. palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{hey, hands down! no sudden moves!}
<A>__{harold puts his hands down and kumar continues his rant, with palumbo improvising little responses.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{let me guess. you were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? you'd pick on guys like us every day. but then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "how can i still give them shit? i know! i will become a cop!" well, congratulations. your dream's come true.}
<A>__{both officer palumbo and harold are getting really pissed. kumar steps in front of harold and offers his friend over to palumbo.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to officer palumbo)}
<D>__{hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? or better yet, arrest him. lock him up!}
<A>__{with that, harold takes a big swing at kumar. kumar sees harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. harold's fist ends up hitting officer palumbo in the face. smack!!!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{oh shit.}
