<L>__{interior jane's kitchen moments later}
<A>__{jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out juice...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why haven't you returned any of my calls or e mails?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{jake, come on. this is just too weird. we have to just never do what we did ever again. you're an adulterer and i'm an awful person, basically. i haven't slept in days. what we did was just so wrong on so many levels.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and it was so right on a couple of levels too. admit it.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(finally settles)}
<D>__{no! it wasn't! on no levels was it right!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company. sitting at the bar, dancing...after dancing...}
<P>__{(she doesn't want to be reminded)}
<D>__{come on, you and i haven't had fun like that in a hundred years.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes! because we're not supposed to have fun like that! we're divorced! are you like, what? unhappy at home? does she not "understand" you? did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? what is this?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'd be lying if i said i never think about you, janey. i think about you. a lot. and no, it's not perfect at home. obviously. look at me. i've got three grown kids and i'm going to kindergarten interviews. i'm a walking cliche.}
<A>__{jane shrugs. she agrees.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and i can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in new york. fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again.}
<P>__{(she pauses...)}
<D>__{and i know... you've moved on with your life, i get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night. can't we just go with it, see where it takes us. no one has to know.}
<P>__{(jane shudders)}
<D>__{you were so great. so loose and sexy. how often do you get to be like that? you can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night...?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not high on my list these days.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{but what if that someone is someone who's known you since you're 23 and loved you for most of your life.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i forgot what a good lawyer you are.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{give this a shot, janey.... life is short and it's tough. don't discount what we have with each other.}
<P>__{(he's getting to her)}
<D>__{you know what they say... people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, so you're saying you think this is a healthy choice for me?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{honey, i know it is.}
