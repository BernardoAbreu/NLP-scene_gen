<A>__{shoulder past, start down the stairs. bradley follows.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{klein!}
<A>__{hit the front door, moving toward my car, junior and the narco brims cagey, primed for another atomic outburst. bradley still behind a prissy, patrician gait as he catches up spooked by that black buick up the street.}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{i said `no direct approach!'}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(my back still turned)}
<D>__{then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{you were instructed to take tommy magdalena alive. do i have to remind you of the coroner's file }
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(turn on him, fierce)}
<D>__{ enough of your `sanderline' bullshit.}
<P>__{(nod to the black buick)}
<D>__{i will checkmate with an admission of guilt to noonan himself.}
<C>__{bradley}
<P>__{(sharp, shrill)}
<D>__{keep your voice down!}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i will bargain immunity in exchange for testimony on how the lapd really runs: magdalena dope profit kickbacks, diskant run out of the city council race on your word, suspended cops pulling shakedowns. i will give noonan a dozen new probes for the one i killed.}
<A>__{bradley stoic, assessing me...sees only `fuck you' resolve.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{i'm assuming command of this investigation myself.}

<A>__{go right at him, cut his steam.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you're scamming something big.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ if you make any further inquiries into this case i will strip you of rank, have your pension revoked and walk that coroner's file into the times myself...stay away from this.}
<A>__{see red. launch. try to wrap my hands around his throat. watch him feather back just out of reach. junior and a pair of six packs restrain me.}
<C>__{me}
