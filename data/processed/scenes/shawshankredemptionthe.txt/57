<L>__{int prison corridor night (1949)}
<A>__{red slips youngblood six packs of cigarettes.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{only cost us a pack of smokes per man. i made my usual twenty percent, of course.}
<L>__{ext license plate factory day (1949)}
<A>__{a tar cooker bubbles and smokes. two cons dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle. the rope goes taught. camera follows the bucket of tar up the side of the building to }
<B>__{the roof}
<A>__{ where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping big padd brushes and spreading the tar. anglz over to byron hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards:}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from texas, and he says, byron hadley? i say, yeah. he says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.}
<C>__{youngblood}
<D>__{damn, byron. sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{i ain't. he was an asshole. run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. figured him for dead anyway. so this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get.}
<C>__{trout}
<D>__{a million bucks? jeez louise! you get any of that?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{thirty five thousand. that's what he left me.}
<C>__{trout}
<D>__{dollars? holy shit, that's great! like winnin' a lottery...}
<P>__{(off hadley's shitty look)}
<D>__{...ain't it?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{dumbshit. what do you figger the government's gonna do to me? take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what.}
<C>__{trout}
<D>__{oh. hadn't thought of that.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. then what happens? you pay tax on the car. repairs and maintenance. goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride...}
<C>__{mert}
<D>__{and drive it, if they're old enough.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{that's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'chrissake! then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. uncle sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. always get the short end. that's a fact.}
<P>__{(spits over the side)}
<D>__{some brother. shit.}
<A>__{the prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work.}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{poor byron. what terrible fuckin' luck. imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{crying shame. some folks got it awful bad.}
<A>__{red glances over and is shocked to see andy standing up, listening to the guards talk.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{hey, you nuts? keep your eyes on your pail!}
<A>__{andy tosses his padd in the bucket and strolls toward hadley.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{andy! come back! shit!}
<C>__{snooze}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{gettin' himself killed.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{god damn it...}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{just keep spreadin' tar...}
<A>__{the guards stiffen at andy's approach. youngblood's hand goes to his holster. the tower guards click clack their rifle bolts. hadley turns, stupefied to find andy there.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{mr. hadley. do you trust your wife?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{that's funny. you're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what i mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? try to hamstring you?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{that's it! step aside, mert. this fucker's havin' hisself an accident.}
<A>__{hadley grabs andy's collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof. the cons furiously keep spreading tar.}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{oh god, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof...}
<C>__{snooze}
<D>__{oh shit, oh fuck, oh jesus...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money.}
<A>__{hadley abruptly jerks andy to a stop right at the edge. in fact, andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the roof. the only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{you better start making sense.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{if you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. see, the irs allows you a one time only gift to your spouse. it's good up to sixty thousand dollars.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{naw, that ain't right! tax free?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{tax free. irs can't touch one cent.}
<A>__{the cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{you're the smart banker what shot his wife. why should i believe a smart banker like you? so's i can wind up in here with you?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's perfectly legal. go ask the irs, they'll say the same thing. actually, i feel silly telling you all this. i'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{fuckin' a. i don't need no smart wife killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{of course not. but you will need somebody to set up the tax free gift, and that'll cost you. a lawyer, for example...}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{ambulance chaaing, highway robbing cocksuckers!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{...or come to think of it, i suppose i could set it up for you. that would save you some money. i will write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and i will prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge.}
<P>__{(off hadley's look)}
<D>__{i'd only ask three beers apiece for my co workers, if that seems fair.}
<C>__{trout}
<P>__{(guffawing)}
<D>__{co workers! get him! that's rich, ain't it? co workers...}
<A>__{hadley freezes him with a look. andy presses on:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. that's only my opinion.}
<A>__{the convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. they look like they've been pole axed. hadley shoots them a look.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{what are you jimmies starin' at? back to work, goddamn it!}
