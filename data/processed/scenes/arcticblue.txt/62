<A>__{corbett sits in the scout for a long moment, weighing his odds. he takes his hands off the steering wheel... eric shoots again, this time smashing the side view mirror and window next to corbett's head. still handcuffed, corbett gets out of the scout. holding the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the scout.}
