<L>__{interior mussburger's office}
<A>__{its door swinging open to admit norville. in the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag draped across her forehead. the receptionist is fanning her with a towel. the door closes behind norville. we hear a rhythmic click click click and the hum of}
<B>__{ventilation.}
<A>__{norville's pov across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which is a large executive chair facing the window. from above the back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. a telephone cord snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from us. on the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large swinging ball bearings. click click click. a tickertape machine occasionally burps information in the far corner of the office. a huge mechanical arm the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock on the facade of the building rumbles by immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws a moving shadow across the office. his back to us, into the phone:}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{ sure sure, parkinson's stupid but he's ambitious, too hard to control...}
<A>__{he swivels around to face norville, who stands deferentially at the door. still listening at the phone, mussburger waves norville forward.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...no! not mcclanahan; sure he bungled the teleyard merger, but that means he's got something to prove...}
<A>__{he covers the mouth piece.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...who let you in?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i }
<A>__{into the phone:}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{atwater? tremendous. except i fired him last week }
<A>__{the intercom buzzes fiercely.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{mr. bumstead is waiting downstairs.}
<A>__{mussburger hits the intercom.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{tell him i will be right there...}
<P>__{(looks at norville)}
<D>__{well, what is it?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i }
<A>__{but mussburger is listening to the tinny voice issuing from the phone.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{you, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. we can't use morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. matter of fact, why don't you fire him. no scratch that; i will fire him.}
<P>__{(looks up at norville)}
<D>__{...make it fast, make it fast.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{you }
<A>__{the intercom squawks.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{mr. bumstead is getting very }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{i will be right there. give him a magazine.}
<P>__{(to norville)}
<D>__{...what're you, a mute?}
<A>__{the second phone on mussburger's desk rings.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...yeah, how's the stock doing? ...bad, huh? well it's not bad enough.}
<P>__{(into the first phone)}
<D>__{...look, chump, either you find me a grade a ding dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom.}
<P>__{(into the second phone)}
<D>__{and that goes double for you.}
<P>__{(into the first phone)}
<D>__{ear clay?}
<P>__{(into both phones)}
<D>__{ood gay!}
<P>__{(slams down both}
<D>__{phones, looks at}
<P>__{norville)}
<D>__{this better be good. i'm in a bad mood.}
<A>__{norville clears his throat.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well, sir. i've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if i could just take a minute or so from your very busy time...}
<A>__{he reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper across the desk to mussburger, who stares, frozen, at norville, making no move to take the paper.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...to show you a, uh...}
<A>__{norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since mussburger will not take it. mussburger doesn't even look at it; his eyes are locked on norville's. mussburger smolders.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...a little something i've been working on for the last two or three years...}
<A>__{mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at norville.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...you know, for kids! which is perfect for hudsucker not that i claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case i'd say it's at least twice that, but i gotta tell ya, mr. mussburger, sir, this sweet baby }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{sudden quiet. with one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings abruptly stop. as mussburger's eyes burn in on him, norville stands mute and paralyzed. his eyes locked on norville's, mussburger circles the desk. he stands toe to toe with norville. he thrusts his face into norville's, whose head moves reflexively back. mussburger's nose is almost touching norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, evaluating. finally he draws his head back.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{hmmm...}
<A>__{with one hand he thrusts his cigar into norville's gaping mouth. with his other hand he raises norville's chin so that his teeth clench it.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{umm hmm...}
<A>__{he steps back, eyes still on norville. he jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair behind the desk.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{siddown.}
<A>__{norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, looks bemusedly from the chair to mussburger.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...go ahead. try it on.}
<A>__{norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...put your feet up.}
<A>__{norville is again reluctant.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...go ahead.}
<A>__{norville obeys. mussburger studies.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{hmmmm... let's get to know one another, shall we?}
<A>__{norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing from between his teeth. mussburger seems to relax.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...let's chat!}
<P>__{(beams)}
<D>__{...man to man!}
<A>__{norville beams.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...you weren't blessed with much...}
<A>__{he waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a euphemism.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...education, were you?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well, i'm a college graduate }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{all right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well, i made the dean's list.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<A>__{norville sputters out some more cigar smoke.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{at the muncie college of business administration.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{sure, sure. and did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...}
<P>__{(searches again)}
<D>__{...'schmoe'?}
<A>__{norville shakes his head.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...'shnook'? 'dope'? 'dipstick'? 'lamebrain'?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{not even behind your back?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{sir! they voted me most likely to succeed!}
<C>__{mussburger}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{you're fired.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{but, sir! }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{get your feet off that desk.}
<A>__{as he struggles to comply:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{get out of my sight.}
<A>__{norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping for a place to set down the cigar. he sets it blindly on a loose stack of papers.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{my god! the bumstead contracts!!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh my god, sir!}
<A>__{the top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the cigar's live end.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{you nitwit! i worked for three years on this deal!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh my god, sir!}
<A>__{norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{i will take care of it. just get out!}
<A>__{mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it into a wastebasket. he pats the fingertips of one hand against his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange circle on the top sheet of the contract. at the other end of the office, norville is wrapping his arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its base. he runs back across the vast expanse of office toward the desk, hugging the water tank whose water gloob gloobs out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees. as he reaches the desk, the near empty tank is now light enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water. he tosses the tank to the floor where crash it shatters, and stands looking about for a place to dump his handful of water.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{why you nitwit. you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh my god, sir!}
<A>__{he is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk, which mussburger cannot see. it is sprouting flame, at which norville ineffectually flecks his remaining drops of water.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{now out of here! out!}
<A>__{norville is already running to the window, which he runs both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{not that way! through the door!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{but, sir!}
<A>__{the windows do not open. norville furiously stomps on the flames in the wastebasket and his foot sticks. further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up and down with his foot.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{right away, buster! out of my office!}
<A>__{norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the flaming wastebasket off his leg.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{up on your feet! we don't crawl at hudsucker industries!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{sir, my leg is on fire!}
<A>__{norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket off his foot. now the problem is what to do with it.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{get out of this office, you dithering nincompoop!}
<A>__{norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh my god, sir!}
<A>__{he winds up and throws it through the closed window. the glass shatters and the flaming basket plummets to oblivion. with the picture window broken a ferocious draft roars through the penthouse office. close shot bumstead contracts on the desk. the pages are sucked away by the draft.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{my god! the bumstead contracts!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh my god, sir!}
<A>__{mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out the window. he runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs his fist clenches around one wafting page he is about to fall }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!}
