<C>__{john}
<D>__{on my roof? you gotta be kiddin'! not on my green chair! tell me it wasn't on the green chair.}
<A>__{wills winces.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, great. now how am i gonna clean that?}
<L>__{exterior another block minute later}
<A>__{john walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious wills }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{look, it doesn't matter that she's sick she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. it's unhealthy... it's... it's inappropriate...}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(with disgust)}
<D>__{what the hell is that? some sorta shrink talk?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{look, if she were just fun... just some sort of diversion... maybe i could justify it. but the worst part is that it's becoming more. much more. it's embarrassing how much i like her. she gets to me. she affects me...}
<A>__{he stops and leans back against a building. he looks around, avoiding eye contact with john, as tears rise into his eyes.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and she's gonna be gone and... i'm not sure i can... i mean... i already think about her all the time...}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{her smile kills me... and the thought... that it'll be gone... forever... that i will never see her again... i don't know... i can't i don't think i'm that strong, johnny. it's too much. i'd rather have it be over... over now. i will start missing her now.}
<A>__{wills is still unable to look at him. john speaks softly }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{buddy, i hate to break it to you, but in the real world... where i live... there're only two kindsa love stories. boy loses girl and girl loses boy. that's all there is. somebody always gets left behind. you try to avoid that, you'll end up an old man toastin' yourself with egg nog in the mirror on christmas eve. you'll end up dying in your own arms.}
<A>__{wills lifts his frightened eyes. john pats him on the cheek.}
