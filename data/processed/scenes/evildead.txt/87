<L>__{86 exterior night cab}
<A>__{an evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ashly carries linda's body outside for burial. he lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel. harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ashly digs linda's grave. she lies on her back during the digging. one of her eyes opens. it is white. ashly drops the shovel and looks at her. she appears to be dead.}
