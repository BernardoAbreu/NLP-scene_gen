<A>__{dark. dim red lights. john stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness. he sees: newt's hyper sleep tube a glass and metal coffin pneumatic piping twines around its base. the glass lid is broken. a small red light pulses at the head of the tube a soft voice and tone, like your seat belt warning is audible...}
<C>__{computer voice}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{seal broken...seal broken...}
<A>__{john finds himself moving towards the tube... looks through the broken lid:}
<B>__{in the tube}
<A>__{there is a splattered blood stain on the sterile white interior. old, turned rust brown. whatever happened here happened a while ago. rust colored drips trail down to }
<B>__{the floor}
<A>__{drag marks. his eyes follow the stains to a pile of bloody clothing against a control panel. a jumpsuit. torn. child size. the head of child's doll, but no body to be found.}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{looks back towards the door. part of him wants to get the hell out here but he fights back his fear. he is a doctor or trying to be someone in here may need his help. he presses forward averts his gaze from the clothing, up to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid }
<B>__{lights}
<A>__{pressure lights. data lights. warning lights. thousands of lights. like the stars in the sky. it's been decades since he's seen technology like this and never this close up. he steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....}
<B>__{on a pale green screen}
<A>__{led numbers race 7,291.01.05...06...07 a legand identifies "elapsed since separation." he moves on...}
<B>__{a video monitor}
<A>__{through scanning bars of snow, an image: a woman with a young girl standing in front of her. the woman's arms are wrapped around the girl. protective. maternal. the woman speaks. her message repeats itself. a tape loop, although john has no idea what that is.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...taking pod four. the crew of the ss sulaco and all marine commandoes are dead. ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle. an overlooked alien egg has hatched. bishop and hicks have been killed. xenomorphs have infested the cruiser. newt and i are taking pod four. the crew of...}
<A>__{the warning tone of the woman's message rekindles john's fear. he moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments drawn to touch a button. click... something tentacle like drops down on his shoulder! just an oxygen mask. john feels his rapidly beating heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. his hand brushes over a sensor which responds by lighting and hsssssssss ! a blast of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe john shouts and back up into another hyper sleep tube!!! next to newt's now empty tube. humming gently. still operational. john approaches it cautiously. he can make out the occupant through the lid...}
<B>__{a woman}
<A>__{the woman from the screen. this is ripley. in hypersleep. wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer type shorts. christ, she looks beautiful. john looks from ripley to her image on the monitor, then back. sinks to his knees, reverent. fascination has replaced fear again. moves his face closer to the lid. closer to hers... daylight spills in john's head whips towards the source of the light }
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{open. kyle and the other monks.}

<D>__{john what is it? is this a supply ship?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. no supplies. kyle, there's someone in here }
<A>__{the second monk looks at kyle.}
<C>__{second monk}
<D>__{this is forbidden.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{john. just get the hell out of there }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't want to stay. i have to get her out before this sinks. you come in, give me a hand }
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{her? look, this is not the supply ship, so this is technology forbidden to us. get out of there now!}
<A>__{john looks down at ripely. a keypad is mounted at the head of the tube. a red button: "emerg open" that's plain enough.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{all right }
<A>__{he presses it. the tube opens with a loud blast of compressed air. the monks at the door recoil at the sound.}
