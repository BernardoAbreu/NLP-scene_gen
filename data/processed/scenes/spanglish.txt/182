<L>__{interior restaurant kitchen half hour later night}
<A>__{they sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the greatest late night meal in the history of western man.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i will remember every taste..forever.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tell you the truth..i wanted a shot at cooking for you.}
<P>__{(shy his heart)}
<D>__{i'm very glad you liked it.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{it's something watching you.}
<A>__{he looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, if it's anything at your end imagine over here...scratch that..the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{don't be crazy. tell me every detail.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, flor, yes i will...they should name a gender after you..looking at you doesn't do it..staring is the only thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything.}
<A>__{she squeals with laughter..he laughs a little himself and in so doing loses his courage..he looks down at his hands..shyness again belting him a good one..still looking down.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{look..forgive me..i'm.....it's just that you are drop dead, crazy gorgeous..so much so that i am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{soon, please.}
<A>__{and now he looks at her.}
<B>__{close on flor..}
<A>__{utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before being swept away.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{right now....immediately..we have to dance or kiss.}
<A>__{he stands. she stands..he kids just a bit, clowning at weighing the two options and then:}
<B>__{his pov..}
<A>__{her face..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no contest.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you sure you're not mexican.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiling he likes this)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i meant you talk like a spanish song.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you kiss like a spanish fly..}
<P>__{(on her confusion)}
<D>__{joking around. i don't know what i'm talking about...}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes you do.}
<A>__{she breaks and heads for the dining room. john has a moment to consider.. he does not have his wits about him..a condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.}
