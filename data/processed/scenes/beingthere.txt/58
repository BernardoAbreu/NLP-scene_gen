<L>__{interior rand's pool room night}
<A>__{allenby opens the door. rand enters in his electric wheelchair followed by chance being pushed by wilson.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{... i don't know what you've heard about me, chauncey, but i'm sure you know everything there is to know. cigar?}
<A>__{rand holds out humidor to chance.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, thank you.}
<P>__{(takes cigar)}
<D>__{no ben. i don't know everything about you.}
<A>__{rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{... no, of course you don't. excuse me for being so presumptuous. no man knows everything about another man however, very few are honest enough to admit it.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{that is so true. you're different, chauncey... quite different than most men.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{thank you, robert.}
<A>__{rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to chance.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(picks up pool cue, weakly strokes the balls)}
<D>__{... you know, chauncey, there are thousands of american businessmen, large and small, that share your plight. i've been concerned with the situation for some time now.}
<A>__{chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the cigar like the man on tv. it will not light.}
<C>__{rand }
<D>__{so i've been thinking about beginning a financial assistance program, chauncey, to help out american businessmen that have been harassed by inflation, excessive taxation, unions and other indecencies...}
<A>__{allenby watches chance trying to light the cigar as rand speaks on, shooting pool as he talks.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{... i'd like to offer the decent 'gardeners' of the business community a helping hand. after all, they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well being of our middle class. tell me, would you have any thoughts on such a program?}
<A>__{chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at allenby, then answers rand.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, ben.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{reluctant to speak, eh, chauncey? well, i can understand that. when a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. just give it some thought, work with the idea, i'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i could give it some thought, ben, but my leg is very sore.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{... oh?}
<P>__{(looks to allenby)}
<D>__{robert, take a look, would you?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{some pain is to be expected...}
<P>__{(bends to chance, looks at leg)}
<D>__{... and i think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{... it's late, i'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(puts down pool cue)}
<D>__{we have common foes, chauncey kid lawyers and our physician!}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{allenby laughs as he takes rand's cigar from him, snuffs it in the ashtray.}
