<L>__{interior operating theatre. night.}
<A>__{inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. there are 3 attending nurses and an assistant doctor. they all look up to bean as he enters, fully kitted up.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{good evening doctor.. what we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.}
<C>__{nurse 2}
<D>__{he's coming round.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{give him a t 70, straight away.}
<A>__{the victim starts to move he looks up we see his face for the first time. it is the police officer, brutus. he is in great pain. as the sedative shot goes in, bean takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. a look of total panic goes over brutu's eyes, as he loses consciousness.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{shall i do the cut, sir?}
<A>__{bean nods he's not going to argue with anyone. the assistant cuts. bean is horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. he can't believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's only my first week.}
<A>__{bean hands the knife to the nurse testily.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the x rays, doctor, or we'll never find the bullet. come on everyone sort out the support systems.}
<A>__{everyone turns to get on with their particular jobs. bean is left with the body. a pause. he gets a little bored. takes a sweet packet out of his pocket. only one sweet left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he always does throws it up into the air, to catch it in his mouth. unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask. it hits the middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body. bean looks down annoyed. checks round him everyone's 'still busy. so he puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers. ..guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. at which second the x ray arrives.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{here we go, doctor. ( studying the x ray ) the bullet is here so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. think we all better be prepared for a long one here. this is tricky.}
<A>__{bean tuts scornfully 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers. they all applaud.}
