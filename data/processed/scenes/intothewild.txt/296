<A>__{chris says nothing. he just looks at jan. they understand each other. chris closes the door. he fiddles with the broken handle of the back door, gets it open, gets his pack out. on top of his pack, a wrapped xmas gift and when he closes the back door, jan heads straight off back to the slabs. chris opens the giftwrap; it's the new hat jan had promised. chris is touched.}
