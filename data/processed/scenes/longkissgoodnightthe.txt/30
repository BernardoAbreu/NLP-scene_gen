<T>__{fade out:}
<A>__{pause. fade in: . super the legend: one week later. establishing samantha's house morning early morning quiet. henessey and samantha are throwing suitcases into the back of his battered chrysler.}
<L>__{interior house later everything's packed}
<A>__{sam's looked better. kneels beside caitlin, says softly:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{that man who tried to hurt us...? if i stay here... other people will come. i have to leave. just for a little while.}
<A>__{caitlin looks at the floor. doesn't respond. samantha reaches in a cupboard. produces a box of candles. lights a match, touches flame to one of them.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window. and never, ever let it go out, because as long as it burns...? it means you're thinking of me. and if i'm alone... if it's dark and i'm lost... it's how i will find my way home.}
<A>__{she touches caitlin's wrist cast. pain in her features. she grabs a marker pen and writes a telephone number on it.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{that's for a portable phone. i keep it with me, you call me anytime, you don't worry about the bill. and last but not least }
<A>__{she reaches behind her head. unhooks the key, the one she wears around her neck.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{for luck.}
<A>__{slips it over her daughter's head. looks up at hal, eyes brimming. he whispers:}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{no matter what you find, i'm not scared. not of you. not ever...}
<A>__{series of shots: exterior suburban town as it fades behind henessey's chrysler. leaving behind porch bound elders, dimestore clerks. grinning children, hair like spun straw. all fading... dissolve to:}
