<A>__{he enters the garage violently. tj sweeps hesher's belongings off the work bench in the garage. he kicks hesher's sleeping bag and pillow. a weathered bass guitar leans against a little amplifier. tj kicks the guitar, snapping it in two. out of breath, he stands in the mess he has created. something catches his eye. he contemplates this for a beat. close on: garden shears. tj pockets them and exits the garage.}
