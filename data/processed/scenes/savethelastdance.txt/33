<L>__{interior jurasinski's classroom morning}
<A>__{the room's seen better days. probably better teachers too. mr. jurasinski looks out at his american literature class and sees nothing but tenure.}
<C>__{jurasinski}
<D>__{in cold blood represents a turning point in our country's literature. take the cap off and tell me why that is, mr. ricard.}
<A>__{wider to include the class. favor "snookie" ricard. we recognize him from the hallway kids wrapped up in patrick. snookie, a flagrant patrick wannabe, sits next to him now. he removes his baseball cap. thoughtfully twirls it on a finger. he truly believes he's being profound.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{gay rights. that compote dude who wrote it? sweet tooth. straight up fag, mr. j.}
<C>__{jurasinski}
<D>__{thank you, mr. ricard. your genius grant is in the mail. anyone else?}
<A>__{no volunteers. jurasinski looks for someone to put on the spot. sees the new girl in a back corner. johnson. he gets into her line of sight. the class shifts in their seats, peeping her.}
<C>__{jurasinski}
<D>__{ms... johnson. you can catch up later. if this is over your head.}
<A>__{everyone looks at her. the way kids look at new kids.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's a non fiction novel. the first of its kind. capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up.}
<A>__{a small murmur goes up. over this, the voice of a dissenter.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{white folks back then felt safe. capote scared 'em. he took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in america's back yard. that's what makes the book special.}
<A>__{sara cranes to see him. god. it's pretty boy. he's sitting on the other side of the classroom. looking... pretty. looking at her. he has nice eyes. not that she noticed.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{yeah. that is part of it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that's all of it. capote wasn't first. richard wright and james baldwin did the same thing. wasn't nobody tryin' to read them though.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{lots of people read them.}
<A>__{a defensive save. patrick sees right through it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{lots of people like who? you? hello. didn't think so.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{mr. j.! girl needs to bone up. give her a pass to the lib'ary.}
<A>__{the room erupts in laughter.}
<B>__{on sara}
<A>__{flushed in the face. embarrassed. pissed. angle widens as jurasinski quiets the class. then.}
<C>__{jurasinski}
<D>__{she can have your pass, mr. ricard. since you obviously never use it.}
