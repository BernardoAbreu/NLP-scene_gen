<L>__{exterior beautiful rome overview}
<A>__{out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses, anna looks out to a lovely view of italy. the vatican truck pulls up behind her. a giddy, blood stained alex and a not so giddy hawk bound out of the back. alex excitedly gives himself an insulin shot.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh thank god, you're dead...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it was so beautiful! when the blanks went off, they...}
<A>__{hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts alex's jaw.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you bastard. you fucked my freedom for a lousy job.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{but i said i was sorry....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no sweat, alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life. what was your per diem?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't act like you've never committed a crime before, hawkins? i know, i made call, when anna tracked me down i...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hudson, don't you understand...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and you, dr. cappucino, you're lucky i don't hit women, assuming you are a woman. i'm not taking anything for granted anymore.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i work for a covert vatican humanitarian organization. the cia made a fool of me. i care for you...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh. well, what's this?}
<A>__{hawk pulls out the demon head that was in the mayflower museum from out of his pocket. anna turns white.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{where did you get this?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you know, the place where you gave the bad guys the codex.... the mayflower museum.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's from the machine. all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2 3 of it already. we can't let that happen.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(pulling out plane tix)}
<D>__{well, forget about it. hawk and i are going to rio. we're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich. right, buddy?...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hudson, god's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you better believe i can. i'm sick of people telling me what i have to do.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's that kind of selfish attitude that...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{selfish attitude? i'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you re not "some guy" anymore, hudson. right now, you're the only guy. without your help, i....}
<A>__{anna looks to hawk with a choked up expression. the weight of the world on his shoulders, hawk turns away to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and swirling toward peaceful clarity.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{the world is beautiful. every day in prison i made sure to remember that. it's only when i actually got out that i forgot. if i was sane, i'd be on that plane to rio. but being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporation's perverted vision does something to your mental health. the world is beautiful and i'm tired of being fucked.}
<P>__{(turning around)}
<D>__{it's darwin and minerva's turn to bite the pillow...}
<A>__{anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross. alex goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that was beautiful.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i laughed, i cried.}
<A>__{shaking his head, hawk swipes the plane tickets from alex.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{rio, alex? after all they've done to...hey, these tickets are for moscow!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(knowing smile)}
<D>__{damn travel agency. that kremlin thing is in moscow, isn't it?}
<A>__{a proud hawk slaps alex on the back as some passing italian locals stop to stare, horrified, at alex's bullet holes. anna sweetly intervenes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ketchup. stupido americani...}
<A>__{the locals give off a slightly dazed "a a h" and move off.}
