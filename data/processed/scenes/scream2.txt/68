<L>__{interior library research computer room late afternoon}
<A>__{a room of the library sectioned off exclusively for computer use. it consists of thirty to forty cubicles that house computer terminals. every cubicle is full. the place is packed. sid sits at a terminal busy at work. her two police guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye out.}
<B>__{close on sidney}
<A>__{her face appears concentrated, focused. she scans the computer screen in front of her.}
<B>__{on the monitor}
<A>__{sid is typing feverishly. suddenly, her screen starts flashing and beeping, freezing her words.}
<B>__{on sidney}
<A>__{confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. she leans back, turning to the guy next to her. a handsome young man.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{excuse me? did your computer just freeze?}
<A>__{the guy leans over and takes a look at sid's monitor.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you have an instant message, that's all. just hit alt m.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm not signed on.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{someone here in the room. all the terminals are connected.}
<A>__{the guy returns to his own computer. sidney eyes the screen suspiciously. she hits alt + m. a message pops up on the screen. "you're going to die tonight." sidney freaks. a muffled cry. she shoots up, looking about the crowded room. he could be anywhere. the two guards take notice, rushing over to her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he's here. he's in the room right now.}
<A>__{she points to the screen. the men instantly break up and cover the room. they start pulling people from their terminals to check their screens. sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing. suddenly, it starts flashing and beeping again. she looks around. she slowly moves toward it, drawn uncontrollably. she hits alt + m. another message pops up: "the police can't save you." close on sidney's face it's stone pale. she takes a deep breath and begins to type.}
<B>__{on the monitor}
<A>__{the words "fuck you" appear. sid hits "send".}
