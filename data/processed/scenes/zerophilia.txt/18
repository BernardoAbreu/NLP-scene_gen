<L>__{exterior langford statuary supply night}
<A>__{sydney makes her way through a barbed wire fence, past a "no trespassing" sign. a lone dog howls in the distance. life size replicas of greek gods, venus and david, all face one way in the mist. their cold stone bodies press up against each other; nude, indifferent. a figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat, a baseball cap over his eyes: luke.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{didn't want anyone around. so, i did what you said.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{amazing, huh?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{weird. awful.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{hmm. was it difficult making the switch?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. it was hard gettin' back. i need an owner's manual.}
<A>__{sydney smiles, nods in agreement.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{a lot of guys could use one of those.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so, what now? do i take pills or something?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{no, it doesn't work like that. this may sound odd, but i need to know if you're attracted to me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what? no.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{hmm. you're not gay, are you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! jeez! i'm just not attracted to you like that.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{okay, calm down. this could be a problem. right now, you can go either way anytime you want. it's a very special and critical time for a z, something you'll experience only once in life.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{don't you see? you get to choose.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't want to choose. i want to be a guy.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires. it's important to know for sure.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{believe me, i know.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i think you need to try again.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{why're you so resistant? if the truth is, you want to be a guy, great, but if not...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{don't even say that!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well, clearly some part of you feels differently. you couldn't change if you didn't want to.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what?! that's crap!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's the thing about the truth. it'll set you free, but first it can really piss you off.}
<A>__{sydney moves to leave.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{this is nuts! i'm supposed to be a guy!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{then what's the problem? you are one.}
<A>__{sydney turns to leave.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're not gonna' help?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i will, the moment you're ready to try again. you can come back to my place right now if you want.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{forget it!}
