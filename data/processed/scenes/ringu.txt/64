<A>__{kazue gives a little bow.}
<C>__{kazue}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{kazue turns to the right. almost immediately after reaching the top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses ryujis face. he heads down the opposite end of the corridor, asakawa close behind.}
<C>__{kazue}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{sir!}
<A>__{ryuji flings open the sliding door to one of the older rooms. there, hanging from one of the walls, is the oval shaped mirror from the video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair. ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing. he turns around as if to look at asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her. asakawa follows his gaze, as does kazue. standing at the end of the corridor is an old man, mr. yamamura. yamamura regards them silently, balefully. breaking the silence, kazue gestures for asakawa and ryuji to follow.}
<C>__{kazue}
<P>__{(softly)}
