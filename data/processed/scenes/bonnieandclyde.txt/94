<L>__{exterior car.}
<A>__{the camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car. the car stops a good distance away and one man gets out, the only occupant of the car. he is tall, dressed in the uniform of the texas ranger. he draws his gun and slowly approaches the car from the rear. on the soundtrack buck's voice continues; as we see all this taking place.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{when he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain he'd caught clyde barrow, bonnie parker, and maybe buck barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang. it took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blonde haired stenographer from the highway patrol . haw! haw!}
<P>__{(everybody busts up with laughter)}
<A>__{in the meantime, on screen, the lawman is slowly approaching the back of the car. suddenly, cut to shot of clyde coming out of the woods, behind the lawman. his gun is tucked in his pants. in a second, he sees what is happening. buck's voice is continuing:}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{anderson was held up as an example for every other texas peace officer today. "that was a mighty brave thing," explained highway patrol chief l.c. winston.}
<A>__{clyde whips out his gun. the following scene is played exactly like a classic fast draw in an heroic western.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{sheriff!}
<A>__{bryce spins around. both men fire instanteously, but clyde has the draw on him, and the aim. the gun goes flying from the sheriff's hand. a really razzle dazzle display of grandstand marksmanship from clyde. immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the man, guns drawn.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{boy! what a shot, clyde!}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{sweet jesus, i never seen shootin' like that!}
<A>__{the gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt. clyde makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs spread, while he frisks him. in general, everyone is excited over the capture. bonnie takes the sheriff's gun and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an object d'art.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(examining the man's wallet, really surprised)}
<D>__{well, now, getta load of this. i want y'all to know we are in the custody of cap'n frank bryce, and frank here is a texas ranger.}
<A>__{rev. angle across hood so bryce's face, not visible to clyde or anyone else behind him, is in foreground. his gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper. his eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but without passion. they are shark's eyes. they have witnessed much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{sure 'nough, clyde?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{say there, peacemaker. i believe you got your spurs all tangled up. you're in missouri, you know that?}
<A>__{clyde has been going thru the man's credentials. not so pleasantly:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you didn't know you was in missouri?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{he's lost, this here texas ranger.}
<A>__{clyde claps bryce's hands behind his back, handcuffs him, spins him around.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(a little pissed)}
<D>__{ he ain't lost...them banks are offerin' extra reward money fer us, and frank figured on easy pickin's, didn't you?}
<P>__{(he suddenly knocks bryce's hat off)}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<A>__{bryce flinches involuntarily. buck suddenly grows wary at clyde's mood. clyde leans into bryce, looking up.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ now you ain't hardly doin' your job, texas ranger. you oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us.}
<A>__{he suddenly hefts bryce's huge bulk onto the fender.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(trying to be casual)}
<D>__{easy there, clyde. why take is so personal.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(to bryce)}
<D>__{reg'lar laws is one thing. but this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that.}
<A>__{blanche looks very uncomfortable. she starts to say something, but buck intervenes.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{like how, clyde? }
<A>__{a tense moment. clyde can't think of anything right away.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(trying to be helpful)}
<D>__{shoot him.}
<A>__{bonnie shoots c.w. an angry glance it's just what the gang doesn't want.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(trying again)}
<D>__{...hang him?...}
<A>__{reaction bonnie carefully gauging the moment to intervene.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{ uh uh. take his picture.}
<A>__{clyde's not sure he's heard right. neither is c.w.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{take his picture?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(pointedly ignoring c.w., brightly)}
<D>__{then we'll let the newspapers have it so's everyone can see captain frank bryce of the texas rangers with the barrow gang }
<P>__{(moving demurely to bryce)}
<D>__{ and all bein' just as friendly as pie.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(grasping possibilities immediately)}
<D>__{...yeah, yeah...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(continuing right on,}
<D>__{coyly picking up}
<P>__{bryce's gun from grill)}
<D>__{ why we 'bout the friendliest folks in the world. texas ranger waves his big ol' gun at us, and we just welcome him like he's one of our own.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(grinning widely)}
<D>__{buck, get the kodak!}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(relieved and excited)}
<D>__{hot dog!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(to bryce)}
<D>__{we're mighty proud to have a texas ranger in the family.}
<A>__{bryce is obviously not pleased with this turn of events. following dialogue is overlapped, ad libbed, etc. a sense of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to exact. new angle. buck is fiddling with the camera, setting up the shot with clyde. buck's following speech should be heard, b.g., to clyde's speech below it.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{...keep him set on the hood, there...more to the sun, like that...yeah...when all his ranger friends see this...i bet he's gonna wish he was dead!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(to bryce)}
<D>__{...see what come o' your mischief?...not doin' your job? down in duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns...you're s'posed to be protectin' them from us, and they're protectin' us from you.}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{ don't make sense, do it?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{c'mon, now, clyde, you and bonnie first. move into him, right close, right friendly.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{all righty}
<P>__{(to bryce, whose}
<D>__{hands are tied,}
<P>__{hemmed in by them both)}
<D>__{don't move, now, hear?}
<A>__{clyde grandly puts an arm on bryce's shoulder, bonnie, looking up admiringly from the other side. buck takes the picture. bonnie immediately hops onto the hood, next to}
<B>__{bryce.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{how's this? "captain bryce and new found friend."}
<A>__{she coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a big kiss on him while still ogling camera.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{...yeah, yeah...quick, buck, get it...}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{...i'm gettin' it, i'm gettin' it.}
<A>__{quite suddenly bryce, whose simmering intensity we should be more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on bonnie. bonnie half screams in disgust, but clyde is on top of bryce in a flash, half strangling on his own fury. he pulls bryce off the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily like a lasso. bryce is literally ricocheted off the car by the force, and, with clyde hanging on by the cuffs, plummets down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men falling, spinning. bryce rises shakily. he tries to walk away. clyde grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him out into the water. bryce smacks into a tree stump poking out of the shallows and goes down. clyde is on top of him. meanwhile, buck has rushed down into the water, tries to pull clyde off bryce.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{i got the picture. i got the picture...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{lemme be, lemme be...}
<A>__{bryce reaches the surface and clyde tries to throw him into deeper water. he hitches bryce over a moldy skiff, knocking aside one of the oars. buck upends bryce into the skiff and kicks it spinning. clyde picks up an oar and hurls it like a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff. it kicks up a spray.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(holding tightly to clyde, yelling)}
<D>__{i got the picture!}
<A>__{reaction. clyde waist deep, breathing heavily.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{...all right, all right...}
<P>__{(to bryce, yelling)}
<D>__{we got you...hear?... remember... you... your face...we got it...we got you...we got you...we got you...}
<A>__{bryce, battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical spectre of clyde, screaming his madness across the water.}
