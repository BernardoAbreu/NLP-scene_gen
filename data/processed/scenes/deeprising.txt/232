<L>__{exterior saipan night}
<A>__{finnegan and trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of trouble. it's quiet in here. maybe too quiet.}

<A>__{they step up to one of the big crates. finnegan starts smashing it with the butt of his pulse rifle. the crate burst open. revealing the warhead of the torpedo. trillian is stunned.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{not unless we kill it first.}
<A>__{finnegan smashes more of the crate, it falls apart, revealing the entire torpedo. he hands her his pulse rifle.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{anything moves, you shoot.}

<C>__{finnegan }

<D>__{if you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{jet ski...there's one left up there.}
<A>__{the plate comes loose. revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red?}
<A>__{he starts to fiddle with the wires. suddenly, there's a loud sloshing sound right behind them! crates topple! more pulse rifles spill out. trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to...}

<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{just the man i wanted to see. on this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...}

<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{not even a joey, i'm glad to see you? joey, what happened to your leg?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?}
<C>__{pantucci}
<P>__{(fast)}
<D>__{red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? a squid?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do i know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...i'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of hercules...fast?}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{for juice, i gotta rebuild. that's not fast.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{how about noise? can you get noise? we don't need speed, just noise, right?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{right...}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?}
<C>__{finnegan}

<D>__{not unless you can wire a missile or fix an engine.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{and what if i run into one of those things?}
<A>__{finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate.}
<C>__{finnegan}

<D>__{don't take too long...i'm not planning on being on the menu tonight.}
<A>__{...and exits.}

<D>__{i've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex... the two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...}
