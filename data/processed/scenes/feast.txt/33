<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{there is a holler at the top of the stairs. everyone turns.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{is it clear?!}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{is there a gun pointing at you?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{nah, i got the gun.}
<A>__{boss man hobbles down the stairs with the help of tuffy. his foot is a bloody mess. he is holding a .38.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{alright goddamn it! who shot me!? who did it!?}
<A>__{belle and bartender move to his aid.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{my goddamn foot is gone! who fuckin' shot me? who fuckin' shot me!?}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(motioning to heroine)}
<D>__{her fella.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{my husband...}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{well, where's the sonuvabitch!?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(noticing destruction)}
<D>__{what the hell happened down here?!}
<A>__{boss man looks to bozo.}
<C>__{bozo}
<D>__{i didn't do it! it was fuckin' monsters, asshole!}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{jesus christ on the cross... someone make sense.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{easy. we're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. some kind of animals. real fast, volatile, predators. one went through three of your patrons like nothing.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{so, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{he only shot you once.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{heroine}
<P>__{(re: bartender)}
<D>__{he shot you the other time.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{it was an accident. sorry.}
<A>__{boss man squints skeptically. adulterer points to grandpa beast's head on the bar.}
<C>__{adulterer}
<D>__{look at it!}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{fan fuckin tastic.}
<C>__{tuffy}
<D>__{my god... what is that?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{that's one piece of four problems.}
<C>__{boss man}
<D>__{please elaborate.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{that head over there, that's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the grandpa. we caught the little one, junior, in the cooler there. as we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{and the rest of 'em?}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.}
<A>__{note: as heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{the next one is taller, but all out of proportion. like a "teen beast."}
