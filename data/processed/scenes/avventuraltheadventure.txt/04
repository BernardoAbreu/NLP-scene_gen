<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{on a calm sea, amid the aeolian isles, just off the coast of sicily, a motor yacht is moving quietly and smoothly over the water. it is heading directly towards a small island that appears like a huge rock jutting up from the sea, sharply silhouetted against the sky, about a hundred yards away. a few sea gulls are lazily wheeling around up above. aboard the yacht, a sailor is at the helm, peacefully smoking his pipe, while another peers out over the water as he munches on a sandwich. it is almost noon. raimondo, a deeply bronzed young man in his thirties, is lying outstretched in the sun on top of the cabin. towards the prow, lying flat on her stomach upon a small rubber mat, is claudia. her arms are dangling over the side of the boat, catching the cool, fine spray of water splashing gently against the prow. corrado comes out of the cabin. he sits down on a bench near the stern after placing a cushion under himself so as not to soil his suit, which is white and of an elegance that is slightly out of style. corrado has a sensitive face, with a look that is both sharp and intelligent. in age, he is closer to his fifties than his forties. following directly behind him is giulia, one of those impossible women who are so terribly sweet and coy and yet so demanding of attention. the pose she strikes as she looks out over the water, and the saccharine tone of voice in which she speaks, are precisely characteristic of her nature.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{it's as smooth and slick as oil.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{i detest comparisons made with oil.}
<A>__{anna also appears on deck, looks around and, noticing claudia, goes over and lies down beside her. claudia rolls over on her back to embrace all that wonderful sun but her outstretched arm comes in contact with anna, who smiles and joins her in a friendly embrace.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{did you sleep well?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, fairly well. but i went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, i fell asleep.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. it lulls you ...}
<A>__{their conversation is suddenly interrupted by sandro's voice shouting "hello." he comes up to them and gives anna a warm hug, then nods hello to claudia. he is in a jaunty mood. stretching himself out on the deck, he opens a picture magazine he had brought with him and starts to read. but anna places her hand over the page he is looking at and says to him:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it would be better for you to get some sun.}
<A>__{sandro closes the magazine and throws it overboard. the pages come apart in the water. some of them are quickly swept under by the waves, while others float and slowly drift away: white specks upon which a few sea gulls converge emitting their guttural cries. as sandro stretches himself out in the sun, anna looks upon him with tenderness. she is about to embrace him but stops midway, and then finally changes her mind. instead, she proceeds to stare at him with a profoundly troubled expression. then, momentarily dismissing her anxiety, she cuddles up close to him in an effort to provoke his affection. sandro responds, but only with a fleeting kiss. seeing them together like this, claudia gets up and moves away to the far side of the prow. sandro and anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow. sandro opens his eyes and sits up. anna does the same. the rocky island is now quite close, almost directly upon them. it is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht. the water beneath the overhanging cliffs is extremely clear and almost motionless. sandro rises to his feet and shouts out to everybody aboard.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{shall we go for a swim?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh, no... please... not here. it looks too dangerous.}
<A>__{the yacht proceeds to encircle the island. up ahead, another island comes into view. it is smaller, brighter, and less foreboding. corrado gets up and comes over to the prow to join sandro, anna and claudia. he is immediately followed by giulia, who peers intently at the landscape.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{you must know your third grade geography book inside out.}
<A>__{giulia looks at him resentfully and abashed. claudia points to an island which they have just passed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what is that one over there called?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{that must be basiluzzo.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sounds like the name of a fish merluzzo, basiluzzo...}
<A>__{corrado then points to an even smaller island which they are now approaching.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{now that one is lisca bianca.}
<A>__{anna, who had been absorbed all the while in contemplating the landscape, though still preoccupied with certain personal thoughts of her own, suddenly unfastens her thin dress. stripping down to her bathing suit, she turns to the group and exclaims with a note of exasperation:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh, my goodness... all that yapping just for a little swim.}
<A>__{she then goes to the edge of the boat, which has slowed down somewhat, and before sandro has a chance to call out to her, she dives into the water.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{anna!}
<A>__{once in the water, anna starts swimming towards the island. the sailor at the helm slows the boat even more so as to keep it within anna's range. raimondo, meanwhile, has gotten his skin diving equipment ready; around his waist he is tightening a belt to which a long knife is attached. the yacht continues to slow down. sandro now dives into the water and starts swimming towards anna. claudia and giulia are removing their clothes and they too get ready to go into the water. but claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{stop ... stop the boat!}
<A>__{the motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt. a sailor places a ladder over the side of the boat. claudia goes down the ladder, easing herself into the water. she moves away from the side of the yacht by swimming backwards. giulia follows her down the ladder but stops on the last rung.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{how's the water?}
<A>__{sandro looks up and, pointing to the rocks at the highest part of the island, answers her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, giulia. that would be really sensational. come on, giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{what has everybody got against me this morning?}
<A>__{from inside the cabin, a feminine voice is heard shouting:}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{raimondo!}
<A>__{solicitously, raimondo goes over to the door of the cabin, from which patrizia emerges wrapped in a filmy nightgown. she is a woman of great elegance, somewhere in her thirties.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{why have we stopped?}
<C>__{raimondo}
<P>__{(kissing her hand)}
<D>__{lady patrizia!}
<A>__{then, holding her by the hand, raimondo leads her towards the prow, where corrado greets her and likewise kisses her hand.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{aren't you going in for a swim, patrizia?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{what makes you think i would even dream of such a thing? raimondo, why don't you go in for a dip?}
<A>__{she turns around to look at raimondo and becomes somewhat startled to see him all rigged out in his diving equipment, complete with mask, spear gun, etc.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{raimondo... do you enjoy fishing underwater?}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{i detest it. but, after all, what can you do... it's the latest...and i try my best to adapt myself.}
<A>__{he dives in. as soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims:}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{who ever said that man was originally a creature of the sea!}
<A>__{then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge. on deck, patrizia peers out over the sea and covering her eyes to shade them from the sun, remarks:}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{i have never understood the islands. with all that water around them, poor things ...}
