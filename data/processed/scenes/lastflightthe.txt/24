<T>__{flash cut :}
<A>__{ the man's body dropping unconscious to the floor.}
<B>__{our four heroes}
<A>__{enter a hallway just in time to see two claridge's employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body. our heroes have missed the fight but shep and bill are delighted anyway. bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well. that's all fixed.}
<A>__{bill straightens his bow tie. already the group seeks a new distraction.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{let's go back.}
<A>__{they head back to the bar.}
<B>__{the bar}
<A>__{nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. after a moment of searching, cary spots her at the bar.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, there she is.}
<A>__{all four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, we missed it.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{did something happen?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, they carried a guy out.}
<P>__{(sees her empty glass)}
<D>__{say! what's become of the teeth?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, the man came and got his teeth.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, what did he say?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{he said thank you for holding his teeth.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what did he look like?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i think he fell in an airplane in the war and got his teeth knocked out.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, why do you think he was in the war?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what makes you think he was a flyer?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{his eyes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{his eyes?}
<P>__{(dry, to the others)}
<D>__{you can tell a flyer better by his ears.}
<A>__{the men chuckle.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, what do you say we have a drink?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fine!}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sure, here's some space.}
<A>__{seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to nikki. shep greets the bartender:}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hello, jean!}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{bon soir, monsieur lambert. qu'est ce que voulez vous [?]}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{martiniiii!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{could i have a champagne cocktail?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{certainment, mademoiselle.}
<P>__{(calls off)}
<D>__{quatre martinis pour messieurs! champagne cocktail pour mademoiselle nikki!}
<A>__{the men are all excited to find out her name. francis uses a pretzel as a monocle to eye nikki.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{nikki?!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nikki?!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{nikki?!}
<A>__{for the first time this evening, shep takes off his dark glasses.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{can you imagine that, fellas? her name is nikki!}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(considers the situation)}
<D>__{her name is nikki. she holds men's teeth. she sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(significantly)}
<D>__{boys, she's gonna be a lot of trouble.}
<A>__{drinks are served. a moment of silence as they imbibe. nikki's hand shakes as she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. she laughs, embarrassed.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, my, my!}
<A>__{shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{poor sweet! she can't even hold her glass!}
<A>__{nikki notices cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his martini.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{oh, well, he can't either. besides, he has to use two hands.}
<A>__{nikki chuckles. a dark look crosses cary's face as he looks at her and puts down his drink. seeing this, bill and francis exchange worried glances. cary abruptly rises and leaves the bar. mystified, nikki looks quizzically at shep who is suddenly grim and annoyed.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{course he can't hold his glass. his hands are burned.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{burned?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{you have no right to spill your drinks. he can't help himself.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{burned? how burned?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{he brought a plane down on fire.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{an airplane? in the war?}
<A>__{shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains:}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{he held the stick. but his hands began to slip. then he held it inside his arms. he was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{did he bring him down safe?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{shep takes a swallow of his martini, sets down the glass.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{brought him down.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, so that's why ?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{yes! that's why he can't hold a glass.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, i'm so ashamed.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{now, cary's had a pretty thin time. his nerves are tricky. you should never call attention to his hands.}
<B>__{at a table}
<A>__{cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless american journalist the unspeakable frink enters and greets him casually.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{hi, cary.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(unhappily)}
<D>__{oh, hello, frink.}
<A>__{cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. rebuffed, frink wanders over to the bar and sees the other men. he has a friendly pat on the back for francis and bill.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{hello, francis. bill.}
<A>__{frink pauses to stare at nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at the bar. then he turns to shep, amused.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{shep. drunk again?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{say, don't you know any other opening remarks? it's about all we've heard from you for a year.}
<C>__{frink}
<P>__{(signals the bartender)}
<D>__{hi! jean!}
<A>__{frink snaps his fingers at jean and grabs a seat next to shep. jean asks for frink's order in french.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{un sidecar.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{sidecar ... [?]}
<A>__{jean moves off. frink regards the others.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{work? what kind of work?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{oh, anything useful.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what could we do? sell washing machines? drive a milk wagon? mend old furniture or somethin'? heh!}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{go back to flying. fly the air mails.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{aw, we couldn't fly a kite.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{maybe a small kite.}
<A>__{francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. bill chuckles.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{well, there must be something you can do.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{we've got to tend to our drinking. we don't get much opportunity.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{lots of things going on outside. sun shining, trees growing, people walking around.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{say! is that still going on?}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{sounds pretty pre war to me.}
<A>__{during all this, nikki has been in her own little world. frink leans over and whispers to shep.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{hey. don't i rate an introduction? who's your swell friend?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{oh, her? just an old hussy we found scattered around.}
<A>__{around her neck, on a slender chain, nikki carries a small lorgnette. it opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. she uses it frequently, peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. on shep's remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. he raises his drink to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(off frink)}
<D>__{pay no attention. sometimes he goes away.}
<A>__{nikki looks away glumly as shep grins at her. she turns and sees something. she raises her lorgnette for a better look at:}
<B>__{cary}
<A>__{who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.}
<B>__{nikki}
<A>__{is pleased to see cary.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh! he didn't go.}
<A>__{she rises to join him.}
<B>__{cary}
<A>__{startled, rises and stares at nikki as she approaches.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, i'm so sorry. your hands...}
<A>__{she tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, your poor hands! your poor, poor hands.}
<A>__{wildly uncomfortable, cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. stunned, nikki watches him exit the building. she realizes she's done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{but shep intercepts her. upset, she whimpers.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(more in disbelief than anger)}
<D>__{if you aren't the worst! first, you insult his hands and make him mad. then you cry over them and make him self conscious. come on back here. come on.}
<A>__{he clasps her hand and leads her to:}
<B>__{the bar}
<A>__{francis and bill watch, disturbed, as shep guides a crying nikki onto a stool beside them. shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. she pulls out a compact to fix her tear stained face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, that's torn it. he'll never come back now.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{then we'll have to find him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{to explain how sorry i am.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(amused at her distress)}
<D>__{we ell. you don't have to get so emotional about it.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who's getting emotional?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{you are. you're coming all apart.}
<P>__{(hands her a glass)}
<D>__{here. take a drink of this. make you laugh and play.}
<A>__{nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. meanwhile, bill leans in.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to shep)}
<D>__{say, what's she crying about?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{she's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(agrees, sadly)}
<D>__{no.}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{frink watches suspiciously as shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to nikki.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{nikki obediently hops off her stool and shep leads her away from the bar, toward the exit. bill and frink are distressed to see her go. bill calls after shep:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey! where're you goin'?!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{oh, out.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{out where?!}
<C>__{shep }
<D>__{out to get a drink.}
<A>__{bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't you suppose you could arrange that here?!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{nope. we gotta go somewheres else.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(without missing a beat)}
<D>__{okay. come on, francis. we got to go somewheres else to get a drink.}
<A>__{francis and bill head out the door. after a moment, frink follows behind.}
