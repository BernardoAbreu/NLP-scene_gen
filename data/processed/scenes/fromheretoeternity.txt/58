<L>__{exterior ocean and beach night}
<B>__{medium shot near shore}
<A>__{a wave sweeps by camera, karen and warden riding it into shore. camera pans with them as they walk out of the water, hand in hand. they stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse. he swings her to him and kisses her.}
<C>__{closeup}
<A>__{as they kiss. the embrace is impassioned. when their lips separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight to something they find is more than sex alone.}
<C>__{extreme closeup}
<A>__{as karen and warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen before and which he normally takes great pains to hide.}
<B>__{medium close shot}
<A>__{as their lips separate again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{nobody ever kissed me that way... not really...}
<A>__{they are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to the kisses. the jump to banter is a quick defense.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{nobody?}
<A>__{camera moves with them as they walk to the fire. karen smiles at him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no. nobody.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{not even one? out of all the many men you've been kissed by?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, that will take some figuring. how many men do you think there've been?}
<A>__{camera holds as they sit, beside the fire. karen wraps one of the blankets around her.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i wouldn't know. can't you even make me a rough estimate?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not without an adding machine. do you have your adding machine with you?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no, i forgot to bring it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then i guess you won't find out, will you?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{maybe i already know.}
<A>__{the defense has given way and there is no mirth in the questions and answers now.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's the matter? what are you hinting at?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{why? is there something to hint at?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe a lot. or maybe you just think there's a lot.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{maybe i do. maybe there's been a long line of beach parties }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you must be crazy !}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{am i? listen, baby, maybe not here. but what about when you and holmes were at fort bliss?}
<A>__{karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up, raging. she speaks as she pulls the dress over her head, wriggles into it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i had to go and forget you were a man with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. for a minute i had to convince myself you were different }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{only it's true, ain't it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes, it's true! a part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. some day perhaps you'll get all the story.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(yaps up)}
<D>__{all what story?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're getting to sound so much like a typical male. so you just sweat it out like a typical male.}
<A>__{she starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking fast, then almost running. warden runs after her.}
<B>__{medium shot beach near path up rocks}
<A>__{as warden catches up with karen. he grasps her arm roughly, hauls her down onto the sand. he stares at her bitterly, waiting f or her to speak.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{all right. i've never told it to anyone before. but i think now is the time. i will tell you the whole bloody messy thing. you can take it back to the barracks with you.}
<A>__{she speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. for much of the story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across the moon.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'd been married to captain dana e. holmes two years. only he was a first lieutenant then. back at fort bliss. we lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... i'm sure you must be able to picture it. it was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. two miles from a neighbor and a telephone....}
<P>__{(pauses, then rushes on)}
<D>__{i hadn't been married long when i knew my husband was stepping out on me. but you get used to that. your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens.}
<B>__{another angle featuring warden}
<A>__{reacting with fury toward holmes, compassion for karen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then, by that time, you're pregnant. and at least you've something else to hope for. i think i was almost happy that night the pains began. even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. i remember dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. he was going to an officer's 'seminar.' he was kidding me about false labor. i didn't think it was humorous. i told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. he smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. but never fear, he'd be back early. and maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat check girl in one of the night clubs.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{listen.}
<C>__{two shot}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. he looked alarmed when he saw me. i guess it was because of my screams. i was lying there on the floor, you see no, don't say anything. i'm not finished yet. of course, the baby was dead. it was a boy. but they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. they even took my appendix out, too. they threw that in free. it was all fine.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{listen. listen. please.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and, of course, one more thing no more children. do you know what that means? you're not a woman. you're not anything. you're a gutted shell... sure, i went out with some of the men after that. a few months of it. i'd been made dirty and i wanted to be clean. you can see that, can't you?... anyway, i got my revenge on dana. i kept on living with him.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{the hateful, miserable }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{listens listen to me }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{all right. i'm listening.}
<A>__{warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love. karen moves closer to him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i know. until i met you i didn't think it was possible, either.}
