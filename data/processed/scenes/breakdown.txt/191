<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior red's house day}
<A>__{police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the house. radios chatter. yellow crime tape holds back onlookers and news reporters. cops and evidence technicians work the scene. a criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried out of the barn. a plainclothes fbi agent closes a cellphone and walks over to where jeff and amy are sitting at a picnic table. they are battered and bandaged.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how's the sheriff?}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<D>__{out of surgery. it looks like he's gonna make it. as for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to protective services.}
<A>__{jeff nods soberly.}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<D>__{we've got i.d. on the dead suspects. turns out they were all licensed truckers. one of 'em had a rap for check kiting. otherwise they could've been model citizens.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what about the leader?}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<D>__{same thing. his real name's warren claney. three speeding tickets in five years apart from that, he's clean as a whistle.}
<A>__{amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{how could they do it? how could they treat it like a... business?}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i don't know. i've been doing this 15 years, i've never seen anything like it.}
<C>__{fbi agent }
<D>__{it was simple, efficient and organized. they stayed on the move, spread it over a dozen states. as long as no witnesses survived, it's an untraceable crime.}
<P>__{(looking at them)}
<D>__{you were just a couple of the lucky ones.}
<A>__{up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the road. a cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over. jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression. it seems like a million years ago... the fbi agent shakes his head, disdainful.}
<C>__{fbi}
<P>__{(re: media)}
<D>__{c'mon let's get you folks out of here before things really get hairy.}
<A>__{he escorts them to a waiting sedan. as they climb in, jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene one last time. he gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready, running alongside the departing sedan, shouting questions. through the rear window, we see jeff putting his arm around amy, pulling her close as we hear:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{promise me one thing...}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{name it.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{next time... we fly.}
