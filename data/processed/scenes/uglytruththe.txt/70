<A>__{the group sits down at the table.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so, you guys here to give me a raise, or what?}
<B>__{under the table}
<A>__{abby tries to kick mike. as she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. the contents spill out and the remote for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping under the table}
<B>__{next to them. at the next table}
<A>__{a precocious kid, 8, sits with his parents. bored out of his skull. when the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks it up and flicks the switch. a small red light turns on. at abby's table as harold and bob laugh, stuart slaps mike on the back.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{that's my guy. always with the jokes.}
<A>__{abby turns to bob and harold.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{we're really excited about the ratings increase this year. next quarter we hope to }
<A>__{suddenly, her smile quickly changes to horror.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{she shifts in her seat, trying to control her now vibrating}
<B>__{underwear.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{nothing...}
<A>__{she leans down to grab her purse.}
<B>__{under the table}
<A>__{she pokes her head under the table to see that the contents of her purse have spilled. mike's head appears next to hers.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm looking for the remote.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what remote?}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(gritting her teeth)}
<D>__{for...the...underwear.}
<A>__{mike starts laughing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you're wearing them? now?}
<A>__{she writhes again, hitting her head on the bottom of the table.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{stuart watches, worried, as abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote.}
<B>__{at the next table}
<A>__{the kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher. abby's eyes roll back. she looks like she's on three hits of ecstasy.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{this ceviche is just so....good! i'm going to ask the chef for the ooh recipe! excuse me }
<A>__{she starts to get up when stuart stops her.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{hold on. tell harold about the new teaser campaign we're starting next week.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{you're going to love this.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, abby. tell us about the teasers.}
<A>__{abby glares at mike and sits back down.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, it's fifteen seconds...each hour.}
<A>__{as she fumbles, mike spots the kid at the next table, remote in hand. he starts to get up but }
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{they're very oh!}
<A>__{abby grabs mike's arm, yanking him back down, in the throes of panic and pleasure.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{mike! wait! you tell them.}
<A>__{she looks into his eyes, imploring.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{actually, i'm really enjoying the way you're telling them.}
<A>__{candi looks at harold, intrigued by abby's display.}
<C>__{candi}
<D>__{what's in a ceviche?}
<A>__{as stuart frowns, concerned, abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{it's fifteen seconds every hour of mike telling an ugly truth and...jesus...god, they're good.}
<A>__{she leaps to her feet.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{ohhhhh...}
<A>__{then she sinks back down, spent. harold and bob applaud, as do the twins. relieved, stuart turns to bob and harold.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{see what i mean about her?}
<C>__{colin}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{you've got to love her enthusiasm.}
