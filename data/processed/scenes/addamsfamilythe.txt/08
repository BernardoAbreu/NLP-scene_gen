<A>__{pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid sized chemistry set. the walls of his room are covered with road signs he's collected "bridge out!", "detour! excavation ahead!", "dangerous undertow!", "keep clear! high voltage!" sawed off stop signs, still on their poles, are stacked in the corner. in another corner stands a cylindrical floor to ceiling fish tank, filled with piranha. this tubby energetic monster of a nine year old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. he mixes chemicals in a beaker. the brew steams. grin ning wickedly, pugsley swallows it down. he contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma tion, then shrinks to the size of a mouse. laughing, he crawls out of his human size pajamas.}
