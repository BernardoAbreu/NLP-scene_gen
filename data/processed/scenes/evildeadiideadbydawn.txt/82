<A>__{medium shot ash as he moves to the piano. the sound is coming from within. suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself; ash draws back from it. it plays a waltz. now the piano music mixing with the harp like strings. the radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange orchestra. close shot ash as he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody. he recognizes the music. it is the same music that ash had played earlier, when linda was dancing. close shot piano and radiator as steam spouts from the radiator pipes. as the piano keys depress and release themselves. the melody grows louder. close shot ash as he lowers his head. his horror gives way to sadness. from his pocket he removes linda's delicate silver locket that dangles from the end of a chain. in the locket's center is a magnifying glass. he stares mournfully into the glass. bang! he looks up sharply toward the main room.}
