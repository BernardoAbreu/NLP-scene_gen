<L>__{interior ice cave continuous}
<A>__{what we originally established as icy, and what later became the unfrozen texas field where the boys discovered the human skull, has been turned to its previously icy state. thanks to two large vents that dr. bronschweig is pointing at:}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{brought on by what?}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{heat, i think. the coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.}
<A>__{they step over to a section of the cave which has been draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this are giving off a cool blue light (passing by two portable drilling rigs which have been erected, their pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.) bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing a man lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to various and sundry machines which are monitoring his life signs. his skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. his heartbeat sending life sustaining blood and energy through his body.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{this man's still alive.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.}
<A>__{the csm is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{how can this be?}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{the developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. we've just slowed the process.}
<A>__{bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard into the man's face and; then we see it. movement. close on man's face though the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can actually see through his tissue and the bones in his skull to see something is living inside him.}
<B>__{angle up on csm and bronschweig}
<A>__{the cigarette smoking man's mind is working intently on all the possibilities, and consequences.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{do you want me to destroy this one, too? before it gestates?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{no. no...we need to try our vaccine on it.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{and if it's unsuccessful?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{incinerate it. like the others.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{this man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{cigarette smoking man}
<D>__{they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus. you'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.}
