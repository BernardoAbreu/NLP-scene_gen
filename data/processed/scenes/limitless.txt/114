<L>__{interior eddie's bedroom day}
<A>__{eddie sits on the bed, the black book open on his knees. eddie looks at the page, then reaches for the telephone. picks it up. hears strange clicks over the dial tone. he puts down the phone, fear on his face.}
<L>__{exterior downtown street day}
<A>__{eddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that man in the tan raincoat following him? he tries to walk faster, but it makes his limp more pronounced. he turns the corner. he seems to have lost the guy.}
