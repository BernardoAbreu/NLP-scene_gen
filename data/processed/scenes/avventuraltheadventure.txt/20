<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{in the seaport town of milazzo, on the sicilian mainland, sandro and anna's father are seated in an office at police headquarters. the sailors picked up on a charge of carrying contraband are being questioned by the police lieutenant.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{no, sir, lieutenant, we weren't even able to drop anchor once ... the sea was too rough.}
<A>__{the lieutenant motions for the sailor to come up to the desk, then points to a sheet of paper in front of him.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{okay. just sign here.}
<P>__{(turning to a guard standing at the door)}
<D>__{have the next one come in. he's the last, isn't he?}
<A>__{another sailor enters and timidly approaches the lieutenant's desk. he is rather young, and his face is completely bronzed by the sun.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{they tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. is that right?}
<C>__{young sailor}
<D>__{yes, sir. my sister is sick... and my father, too.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{so that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? you need the money. now, i can help you. i can see that you get some assistance from the government. but first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...}
<A>__{the sailor starts, as though taken by surprise, then quickly answers.}
<C>__{young sailor}
<D>__{yes, sir. three times.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<P>__{(to sandro and anna's father)}
<D>__{now, we're getting somewhere! they're beginning to contradict each other.}
<P>__{(then, facing the sailor again)}
<D>__{now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... and what about the other boat?}
<C>__{young sailor}
<D>__{what other boat?}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. what have you got to say about that?}
<C>__{young sailor}
<P>__{(stuttering)}
<D>__{i ... i ... wasn't feeling well ... i.. i was sleeping... i don't know anything ... i ... i'm all mixed up and ...}
<A>__{sandro is unable to control himself any longer. he gets up, walks over to the sailor and yells in his face.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but what are you saying?... what are you saying?}
<A>__{the lieutenant motions to sandro to be quiet, then calmly rises from his desk and continues.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{now look here, i'm ready to forget the whole thing: the cigarettes, the contraband everything. if you would only tell me... you or your friends... whether the girl was aboard your boat and how far she went.}
<A>__{they all remain silent. the lieutenant motions to the guard who then leads the sailors out of the office.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<P>__{(to anna's father)}
<D>__{just as i thought. even if you caught them in the act, they'd deny it. they always deny everything. and then, in this case, if they were to admit having had the girl aboard, it would mean they'd be admitting to the charge of carrying contraband. oh, it's easy to say: talk! but if they did talk, the following morning you'd find them cold dead in front of their doorstep.}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{i think it would be worth my while to take a run over to palermo. the chief of police there is a very good friend of mine and i'm sure he'll do whatever he can. i feel we're wasting our time here... excuse me, lieutenant. i hope we see each other again under better circumstances. and thanks for everything.}
<A>__{bidding goodbye to the lieutenant, anna's father leaves, without looking at sandro. a moment later, sandro folds the newspaper he was reading, tucks it under his arm, and starts heading towards the door.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{at any rate, we'll continue investigating. i know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to all areas...}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(showing the newspaper to the lieutenant)}
<D>__{tell me, lieutenant, do you happen to know this f.z. who wrote this article here?}
<A>__{the lieutenant takes a look at the paper which carries a two column story headed: disappearance of a roman tourist at lisca bianca.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{that's francesco zuria. he's the news correspondent.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{where can we locate him? don't you think that by offering a reward to anyone who can give us some information...}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{zuria is in messina. you might try him. shall we phone him?}
<A>__{from the opposite end of the corridor through which sandro and the lieutenant are walking, appears the sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on which claudia toured the islands in search of anna. after saluting his superior, the sergeant says:}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{have you any instructions for me, lieutenant? may i return to lipari?}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{yes. with whom did you leave the crate of cigarettes?}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{i left it at the warehouse.}
<A>__{the sergeant again salutes his superior, then continues on his way along the corridor. sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{pardon me, sergeant, but when did you get back?}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{about two hours ago.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and the young lady who was with you?}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{i don't know... she said she had to catch a train.}
<A>__{sandro remains a while, absorbed in his thoughts, then hurriedly leaves the building, and heads towards the station.}
