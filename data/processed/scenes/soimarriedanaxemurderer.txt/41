<A>__{allen ginsberg is on stage. he is brilliant. tony, charlie, and harriet are all amused. susan is bored stiff. charlie is looking at tony. tony glances over at susan and gives charlie an "oh, well." look. then he looks at harriet and nods in approval of her.}
<L>__{exterior fisherman's wharf night}
<A>__{the four of them walk along the wharf. charlie is at one of those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets and try and knock them down. charlie knocks two down.}
<C>__{arcade man}
<D>__{one more and you get your pick.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to harriet)}
<D>__{you do it.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{no, charlie. i'm the worst.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{come on, you'll be great...}
<A>__{the arcade man turns around to watch. harriet winds up and throws the bean bag directly into his neck.}
<C>__{arcade man}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{sorry... i told you charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, no, you're okay, you're just having control problems.}
<A>__{they both start laughing. he puts his arm around her. in the b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co worker. they continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a house of horrors. it looks somewhat run down and harriet looks questioningly at charlie.}

<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{yeah, let's go in.}
<A>__{tony nods agreement. susan looks bored. they go inside the}
<B>__{house of horrors}
<A>__{it's as low rent as charlie described. the "keeper of the threshold" so described in a poorly written sign, is an overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. he looks like a roadie for the band, kiss. he stands at a podium, smoking and reading a paper. as charlie, tony, harriet and susan pass the threshold keeper, he takes a casual drag of his cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment utters:}
