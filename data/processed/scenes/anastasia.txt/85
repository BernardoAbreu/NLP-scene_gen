<L>__{exterior cabin door night}
<A>__{vladimir and dmitri wait outside the door. the door opens and anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. dmitri and vladimir are surprised as anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. "reprise of vladimir's song (over montage) the tone of the song would now change the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. the tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. the song would end as anya and dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. montage: (mos) on deck: anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. dmitri and vlad can't even stand due to the motion. anya looks back and flashes them a smile. in their cabin: dmitri gets out of the bed he's been sharing with vlad and walks over, past where anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind. he closes is and see's anya she looks beautiful he bends down to pull up her covers and she slugs him. under a table: meetoo is walking around sniffing feet. suddenly, he runs smack into the two ugly pug dogs who growl at him. he runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs. on deck: the sea is calm, but anya wearing the heeled shoes for the first time is teetering and wobbling like mad. dmitri and vlad watch her with amusement. anya turns to them. on deck: dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as anya watches him with great vindication. ballroom: anya walks into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of dmitri. dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently. their cabin: vladimir is directing anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. dmitri enters and is directed to join anya. he does and they dance together, with anya clearly leading. the boat sways to the left and anya is thrown closer into dmitri's arms. neither of them even try to readjust.}
