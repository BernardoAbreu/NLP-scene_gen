<L>__{interior hotel bathroom night}
<A>__{she moves in, stares in the mirror sees the side of her face and her shoulder, smeared with black. she fumbles for the light, flips it on. in the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re enters the world... and the black of the liquid that's stained amy's face and hands, that track the floor of the white tiled bathroom, that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color the color of blood. amy gasps at the sight she looks like she's just crawled out of a slaughterhouse. she reaches behind her, feeling her back, trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be pouring out of her, dripping to the floor, pouring down the small of her back, staining the back of her panties a vivid, ghastly red. in a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full blast, washes away the blood from her hands, scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of her body. the water drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a nasty pink. she reaches behind her back, feeling again her hand comes back as vividly red as before. again she washes them. she stops dead, seeing something in the mirror. something is glinting between her breasts. she touches her finger to it. it looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel splinter. it appears to have just barely broken through the skin from "inside" barely a drop of blood. she stands staring down at it, breathing fast. what the hell is it? then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to the mirror and looks over her shoulder. she sees and we see for the first time the center of her back where her questing hands couldn't reach. there is a knife there, literally thrust through the middle of her back. the gleaming splinter between her breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her and clearly transfixed the center of her chest her heart. she strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. she turns back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.}

<D>__{it's not real... it's not real.}
<A>__{she clenches her eyes... opens them. her fingers feel desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. it's still there.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{wake up... wake up... wake up...}
<A>__{she starts slapping her hands against the side of her face not gently, hard slaps. but she isn't "waking up." she grabs her hair, pulls hard. nothing. she's still there. the knife is still stuck, impossibly in her back. she sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing what to do. she reaches again for the knife, but she can't touch it. she buries her face in her bloody hands.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming...}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{i'm dreaming!}
<A>__{she stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to do. she looks around her bathroom, searching for something. she tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches beneath the sink, tugging the various stuff out. whatever it is that she's looking for, she can't find it. she spins back to the mirror. opens it. slips back against it wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine cabinet. holding one hand against the mirror, she starts to push away, wincing in pain. we can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish from view, drawn back inside her body . slowly, making a wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide out. with a gasp she heaves out... and the knife goes flying. it bounces on the floor, splattering blood. with shaking hands, amy bends over and picks it up. she stands, staring at it. it's some kind of nasty stiletto. amy stands, staring at it.}
<B>__{a flashback}
<A>__{amy searching marla's drawers, tugging one open pressing the stud on a stiletto. on this stiletto.}
