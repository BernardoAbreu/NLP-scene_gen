<C>__{clay}
<D>__{when...?}
<C>__{roque}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{traitor...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{you gave me no choice. it was always gonna end like this, clay. us captured or dead. it was always a dead end. you made sure of it.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(spitting blood)}
<D>__{bullshit...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{not bullshit. you were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit max until it got us all killed.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{yes, clay. yes. only difference with this situation is at least i get to walk away.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we all could have walked... used the drive...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{don't you get it yet? there is no drive. there never was...}
<A>__{wade begins laughing. clay looks like he's been slapped.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{fennel made it up to save himself. when i told wade, he planted the info at goliath to lead you here.}
<A>__{clay stares at him.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{you really thought there was a happy ending coming? pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be soldiers again?}
<P>__{(leans down; softly)}
<D>__{we lost the moment we went off mission. this is just the logical conclusion of that playing out. you didn't want to hear it.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{you just wanted your revenge. your face to face with the big bad wolf. i'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world...}
<A>__{roque straightens back up, shaking his head:}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{guys like us don't beat guys like him.}
<A>__{in the corner, wade nods at this. behind him, a large semi pulls up to the cash container. over the following, a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{kill me now... maybe you live through this.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{oh, we're not gonna kill you. someone's gotta get away with the cash. your crew? i'm definitely wasting them. but you?}
<A>__{he nods to the hydro winch slowly lowering the cash container onto the flat bed, with a smile...}
<C>__{wade }
<D>__{you're about to steal a billion dollars from the central intelligence agency.}
<A>__{clay stares at daggers at both of them.}
<C>__{wade }
<D>__{it's for our replacement nuke. when a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{max really does love to frame you...}
<A>__{several par sec guards arrive. wade points to clay:}
<C>__{wade }
<D>__{take him away. drop him in newark.}
<P>__{(to roque)}
<D>__{i will see you at turner airfield.}
<A>__{the guards handcuff clay and drag him to his feet. pushing him towards the door. as he hustled past roque:}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{they stop. roque looks at his old friend.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{i'm sorry it had to end this way.}
<A>__{clay stares back at him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're going to die very badly.}
<A>__{the guards hustle clay out the door...}
