<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{ harolday wanted the k.c. like he wanted the santee and the hardman place, for his land scheme he planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers. he pretended to be on the outs with me so i could get caldwell's confidence. and when red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me harolday shot him.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{why did he kill clint? an' not me?}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{that shot was an accident it was meant for you. we planned on getting the women to let me handle their business }
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(interrupting, furious)}
<D>__{ and do us out of everything }
<P>__{(moves close to garvey)}
<D>__{you vile wicked despicable }
<A>__{she is beside herself in her anger and taking up a large vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over garvey's head. garvey goes down unconscious. miss martin rushes to her room screaming. clara follows her. on dave grinning broadly rocklin comes to him}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{when he wakes up we'll have him put everything on paper.}
<C>__{dave}

<P>__{(his eyes flash with an idea)}
<D>__{yeah i believe i am.}
<P>__{(looks at the group)}
<D>__{i know i am.}
<A>__{he starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. rocklin's eyes wander to clara, who seems quite at a loss. now he moves slowly toward her. in the b.g. arly watches rocklin's every move.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i guess there's no rush for you to get to garden city, now }
<A>__{after a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of arly, clara speaks.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no i don't suppose there's any rush }
<A>__{there is another short pause. rocklin glances at arly, and arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the door, leaving julio attending garvey.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(after arly goes)}
<D>__{if i was like her, i'd stay in the west.}
<C>__{rocklin}
