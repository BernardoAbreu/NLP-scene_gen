<L>__{interior main room}
<A>__{the cops pin everyone up against the wall or on the ground. everyone is lined up, searched. i.d.s are checked. bobby turns to rosario:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{gimme your shit!}
<A>__{troubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his palm. bobby quickly swallows them. a uniformed cop approaches bobby:}
<C>__{uniformed cop}
<D>__{hey! i saw that! get your hands on your fuckin' head!}
<A>__{bobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; rosario is tossed aside. the uniformed cop, to someone else:}
<C>__{uniformed cop }
<D>__{jessie! this one just ingested!}
<A>__{all patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly lined up, hands clasped on the backs of their heads. paramedics speed to the ladies' room. jessie the cop takes out a ketchup squeeze bottle except it's black and forcibly fills bobby's mouth with charcoal:}
<C>__{paramedic}
<D>__{arright, open up a little charcoal, to absorb the toxin...}
<A>__{as bobby gags, joseph walks through the club with confidence. the place, though absolutely packed, is uncharacteristically silent. he turns to uniformed cop #2:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{give everybody a toss. g.q. }
<A>__{this gets mike's attention. joseph signals something to him, he nods, moves to the back. joseph walks over to louis, pokes his gut:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{too much pizza, right there.}
<A>__{several cops laugh. then: joseph sees bobby, and vice versa. close shot on joseph. he sobers, his brashness muted. joe walks toward vadim and his party. vadim has his face to the wall. joseph kicks his legs further apart. (joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on vadim.) in russian, subtitled:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{turn around... turn around!}
<A>__{vadim turns around. joseph starts to search him. he pulls a wad of money from vadim's pocket:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{what is this?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{want me to double your money? huh?}
<A>__{vadim doesn't answer. joseph takes out a huge swiss army knife he's got on his keychain. he cuts the wad in half.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{okay. it's doubled now, how's that.}
<A>__{michael and jack search the other members of vadim's party. they rip out pockets. michael points to a woman's fur:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{you got anything in there?}
<A>__{he motions for the mink. she hands it over. he pats it}
<B>__{down carefully. nothing. across the room}
<A>__{the uniformed cop puts handcuffs on bobby and others. rosario watches, upset but powerless. louis is down, next to bobby. unwittingly referring to bobby's brother:}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{jesus, that cop's crazy!}
<C>__{uniformed cop}
<D>__{hey! fat albert! shut your fuckin' mouth!}
<A>__{several officers charge through now, pulling the latino man and the young dark skinned white man (in cuffs) from behind the coat check. bobby is pulled up, on his feet.}
<B>__{back to}
<A>__{joseph interrogating vadim. as he looks through i.d.:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{you got a cross and a jewish star on you?}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski }
<D>__{the cross is for good luck.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{what's the star for?}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{that one's for god.}
<A>__{just then, michael solo interjects. in joseph's ear:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{coupla dimes on `em cocaine, a little pcp.}
<A>__{joseph nods, acknowledging this news. he eyes vadim, then turns to the two men:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{okay, let's go. you. and you }
<P>__{(to the young man)}
<D>__{you're under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics }
<A>__{michael reads two other men, one of whom is a tall man from near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their miranda rights in a totally perfunctory manner. almost mumbles them. paramedics exit the women's room. girls are on stretchers. marat buzhayev enters the main room of the club. he is escorted by two uniformed officers, who are very obviously not arresting him. they are asking him questions and writing down his comments. he turns to see: a humiliated bobby, who eyes him back. bobby is then quickly ushered out along with tens of others. marat watches, as does rosario. louis and rosario are left behind, not having been arrested. neither has vadim. joseph moves close to vadim. with arrogant brio, re: the dark skinned white man, in russian, subtitled:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{your boy's gonna turn. and then we'll come back for you.}
<A>__{joseph eyes vadim, virtually mocking him. vadim eyes joe back with silent rage on his face. then the cops push the young dark skinned man out, and as they do, he turns back to vadim. the young man is terrified. bobby, too, is hauled out like a common criminal. cuffed...}
