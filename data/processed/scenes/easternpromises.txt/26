<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{the trans siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and cigars. the party is in full swing with two dozen guests and family. one of the golden haired children is playing violin badly. the language is russian, english and turkish mixed. kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table. his mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel to answer it. when he hears the voice, kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot. semyon notices but hides his concern. as kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy, asking a question in russian.}

<C>__{kirill }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, not the beach. it's an english expression, you fucking baboon. i mean...}
<P>__{(hissing out of ear shot)}
<D>__{...there are no police. you sure? good. kirill glances over at semyon, who is apparently lost amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of his eye he is watching kirill.}
<C>__{kirill }
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{no, my dad's not involved. i'm a big boy now. i do my own stuff. yeah. merry christmas. kirill cuts the call and nods to ozim, who stubs his cigar. semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to one of the violin playing angels, smiles, and kisses her on both cheeks.}
