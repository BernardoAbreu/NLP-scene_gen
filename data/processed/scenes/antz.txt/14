<L>__{interior termite tunnel night}
<A>__{...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound. the corridors here are primitive, caveman like, pocked with jagged access holes. no sooner has z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at z's head. z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straightthrough the wall in order to escape...}
<L>__{interior termite queen's chamber night}
<A>__{...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex the queen's chamber. this is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive (to z) column of piled stones. the termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot long monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite nurses. the queen turns to look z right in the eye.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{excuse me. i seem to be lost, and i was wondering if you could give me }
<A>__{before z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a piercing, blood curdling shriek. the nurses start shrieking too.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(backing away)}
<D>__{i will let myself out.}
<A>__{but the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite thebiggest one we've seen yet who is charging headlong at z, jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(backing away)}
<D>__{shoo! torro! torro!}
<A>__{at the last moment, z jumps out of the way and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber. as if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut andshatter the base of the column. the walls of the room begin to rumble... the termite turns to eat z...but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder andcollapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen. as the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above...they keep struggling until...}
<C>__{ant officer}
<P>__{(points at z)}
<D>__{he's killed their queen!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{hey, i'm sorry, it was a mistake }
<C>__{ant officer}
<D>__{victory!!!}
<A>__{we can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(facetious)}
<D>__{this is terrific! let's exact crippling war reparations! let's set up a puppet government!}
<C>__{ant officer}
<D>__{let's slaughter them all!}
<A>__{the ants set about killing the disoriented termites when...we hear another rumble coming from the outside...the ants look up confusedly... ...and a (from the ant's point of view) five hundred footlong tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a crash. the ten or so ants standing directly below aresmashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater. as quick as it appeared, the tongue retracts, with a hideous sluuurping sound. we can now see the end of the snout of an ant eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above...}
<C>__{ant officer}
<D>__{incoming!}
<A>__{the tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and again... z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down again, barely missing him! z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him, across the tunnel from intersecting access tunnels, getting closer and closer to z, dragging more and more screaming ants and struggling termites... ....then the tongue disappears. silence. z wipes his brow... and we hear a thunderous sniffing noise as the anteater searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down the corridor right towards z, the tip squirming as it ricochets along the walls! z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him, reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed indiana jones in raiders of the lost ark! the walls disintegrate under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to z...closer... ...and just misses him as z tumbles out of the stump and down to the ground...z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.}
