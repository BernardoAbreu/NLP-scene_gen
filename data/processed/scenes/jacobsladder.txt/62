<L>__{interior jacob's apt. evening}
<A>__{jacob emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe. jezzie is moving rapidly around the kitchen.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it'll be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it's in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. don't drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he did? when?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(grabbing her coat)}
<D>__{while you were in the shower.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why didn't you call me?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{he didn't give me a chance.}
<P>__{(she pauses nervously)}
<D>__{look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what? what do you mean?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{he said you didn't have one.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i don't know. that's all he said. he wasn't very friendly. oh, yeah. he said your buddies backed down. they chickened out, he said.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't believe this.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{baby, i'm sorry. i feel terrible. i'd stay and talk but i'm so late. look, don't be upset. we'll talk when i get home. see you around midnight.}
<P>__{(she kisses him on the cheek)}
<D>__{bye. and don't brood. watch t.v. or something.}
<A>__{jacob's apt. frank's apt. intercut the door slams securely. the locks set. jacob begins instantly rifling through a desk drawer. he comes up with a frayed address book and looks up a number. he dials.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{frank. it's jake. jacob singer.}
<A>__{we see frank standing at a window fingering the venetian blinds. he does not reply. the scene intercuts between the two men.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen, i just got a strange call from geary. he said the guys backed down. what's he talking about?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(fingering the venetian blinds)}
<D>__{that's right. we did.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what does that mean, frank? i don't get it. why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's hard to explain.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{well, try, huh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't know if i can. it's just that war is war. things happen.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's nothing to expose.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jesus christ! who's been talking to you?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{what's going on? how can you just turn away?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{what about the others?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they're not interested, jake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shit! you know it's not half the case if i go it alone. we're all suffering the same symptoms, frank. the army is to blame. they've done something to us. how can you not want to know?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{maybe it's not the army, jake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe there's a larger truth.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe the demons are real.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddamn it. what kind of bullshit is that?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{listen, jake. i gotta go.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm hanging up.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hey, wait!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't bother to call again, okay?}
<A>__{frank hangs up. jacob stands holding the phone for a long time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook. the sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. quickly jacob tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. they aren't there.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shit!}
