<L>__{interior beverly's study night}
<D>__{bill stands in beverly's empty study. absorbing the room, the man, the stillness. picks at the papers on the desk without specific purpose. turns to one of the many bookcases, eventually finds a book, smiles.}
<L>__{exterior weston house front porch night}
<D>__{barbara sits on the front steps. it's dark now, but still very hot. moths bat at the porch lights. bill comes out carrying a coke, shares it with barb.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ivy leave?}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{i'd forgotten about the lightning bugs. around the yard, flitting in and out of the low hanging boughs of the trees.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{look what i found... she turns, he holds a thin hardback copy of meadowlark.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we have copies.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i don't remember a hardback edition. think this is worth something... first edition, hardback, mint condition? academy fellowship, wallace stevens award? this book was a big deal.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it wasn't that big a deal.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{in those circles, it was.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{those are small circles. he opens the book, perusing the first pages. reads.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{"dedicated to my violet." that's nice. christ, probably every word he wrote after this he had to be thinking, "what are they going to say, are they going to compare it to meadowlark?"}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{jean go to bed?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just turned out the light. you'd think at some point, you just write something anyway and who cares what they say about it. i don't know }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{will you shut up about that fucking book?! you are just dripping with envy over these thirty poems my father wrote back in the late sixties, for god's sake. y'hear yourself? bill's taken aback, but doesn't want to overreact.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i have great admiration for these poems }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{my father didn't write anymore for a lot of reasons, but critical opinion was not one of them, hard as that may be for you to believe.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what are you attacking me for? i haven't done anything.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i'm sure that's what you tell sissy, too, so she can comfort you, reassure you, "no, billy, you haven't done anything."}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why are you bringing that up?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{they're all symptoms of your male menopause, whether it's you struggling with the "creative question," or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{all right, look, i'm not going to be held hostage here while you attack me. and her name is cindy.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i know her stupid name do me the courtesy of recognizing when i'm demeaning you.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{violet really has a way of putting you in attack mode, you know that? you feel such rage for her you can't help dishing it }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{psychoanalyze me right now, i skin you.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you may not agree with my methods, but you know i'm right }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{"your methods." thank you, doctor, but i actually don't need any help from my mother to feel rage.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you want to argue? is that what you need to do? pick a subject, alright, let me know what it is, so i have a fighting }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the subject is me! i am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! i am in pain! i need help! barbara heads into the yard to get away from him.}
