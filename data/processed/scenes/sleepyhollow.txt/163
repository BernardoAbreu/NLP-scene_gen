<A>__{ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery unbearable. he climbs in the coach.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{do not go, constable. how can you leave?}
<A>__{inside the coach, ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes his eyes. he pounds twice on the coach wall. outside, van ripper whips the reins. the coach starts. young masbath follows. the coach picks up speed on the long straight road. young masbath stops, wiping tears.}
