<L>__{interior norville's office}
<A>__{looking at its frosted glass door; the sign painter is just finishing lettering in: norville barnes, president. the sign painter makes way as we see norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is wheezing heavily. he is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms. he tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand. the door opens as norville swings around to enter. he is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode. he swings around to kick the door shut. we see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of norville's pants: senrab ellivron tnediserp. weakly, still cradled in norville's arms:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm sorry we had to take the stairs. it was just that horrible little elevator boy...}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{not at all. you're light as a feather.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(pointing languorously)}
<D>__{the couch, please.}
<A>__{still wheezing horribly, norville staggers over to the couch and deposits her gently on it. he straightens up and looks at her. norville's pov she is smiling wanly at the camera. the entire image pulsates as the blood pounds behind norville's eyeballs. we hear the loud, rasping of his breath, resonating inside his head. amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as if coming from a long way away.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{he perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his head between his knees, still fighting for breath.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't know what came over me. i suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever. but then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry...}
<A>__{speaking into his knees as he wheezes:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{hungry, anyway.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...}
<A>__{norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her head.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...suffice it to say that i'm jobless though not for want of trying, that i'm friendless, with no one to thank you take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did }
<A>__{she screams, staring down at the couch. norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking. on the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is printed, in wet ink, right side around: norville barnes, president.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{norville, i didn't know you were president here!}
<A>__{norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. when the nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the seat of his pants. distracted but still modest:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh, it's nothing really. just determination and hard work...}
<A>__{he unbuckles his trousers.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...of course, when i started in the mailroom last tuesday i thought it might take more time }
<A>__{buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{say, buddy, here's the whiskey you asked f }
<A>__{he freezes, taking in the scene: amy reclining on the couch; norville standing in front of her with his pants around his ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in his own hand.}
<C>__{norville}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{thank you, buzz, just leave it on the desk.}
<A>__{leering:}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{happy days, buddy...}
<A>__{as he turns to leave:}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{...and i will tell your secretary you're not to be disturbed. yowzuh!!}
<A>__{he snaps the elastic strap under his chin. after the doors shut behind buzz:}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(shuddering)}
<D>__{what a horrible little person.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh, buzz is pretty harmless, really }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world }
<A>__{norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{a little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{i myself }
<A>__{he crosses back to the desk.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place }
<A>__{norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no thank you. seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years }
<A>__{over norville's shoulder he has been pushing the box towards her. the box tilts lazily forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. we hear the thud of the box landing amid the pitter patter of cigarettes raining onto the carpet. amy's brow crinkles. continuing:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{ these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{mind if i join you?}
<A>__{he is pouring himself a drink.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{be my guest. a little town you've probably }
<A>__{he tosses back his drink, gags, looks at amy with his eyes bulging.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{once again her image pulsates. there is a roaring sound and an airy steam whistle as she silently moves her lips.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{he waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{excuse me i executive washroom...}
<A>__{he staggers out a side door. on his exit amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his desk. at the top of her voice:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{are you all right?...}
<A>__{she throws open the top desk drawer. inside two lonely lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer. amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a match off the desktop.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...is it your lunch? the chicken a la king?}
<A>__{from the washroom:}
<C>__{norville }
<D>__{no, i }
<A>__{amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an appointment book. as she hurriedly flips through page after blank page an arctic wind whistles emptiness. one page only has a notation: 11:45. address wilkie grammar school junior achievers club.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{is the a la king repeating on you?}
<A>__{amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer.}
<C>__{norville }
<D>__{...i'm fine, i... you were saying?}
<A>__{she mutters:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{values... watchwords... uh, tender years...}
<P>__{(aloud)}
<D>__{ a little town you've probably never heard of...}
<A>__{she hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to disperse the smoke.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...muncie, indiana.}
<A>__{she scurries back across the room as we hear the faucet being turned off: she re strikes her languid pose on the couch just as the washroom door opens. norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his forehead.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{you're from muncie?!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why yes, do you know it?}
<A>__{norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and loud syncopated grunting noises. amy gapes at him. he starts singing, off key:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{'fight on fight on dear old muncie fight on hoist the gold and blue you'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' once 'the munce' is done with you!'}
<A>__{amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, obvious rhyme. norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly follows sit, also pumping her fists. as norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...goooooooo eagles!}
<A>__{amy awkwardly imitates. norville excitedly sits behind his desk.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...a muncie girl! talk about the cat's pyjamas! tell you what, amy. i'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the hud.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh, no, really, i }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. matter of fact, i know where a vacancy just came up.}
<A>__{he hits the intercom.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...mail room.}
<A>__{to amy:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...this'll only take a moment.}

<D>__{good afternoon to ya, this is norville barnes }
<C>__{intercom }
<D>__{barnes! where the hell have you been! and where's my voucher?!}

<D>__{i need that voucher! i told you a week ago it was important!}

<A>__{click. the intercom goes dead.}

<D>__{oh, of all the foolish... listen, do you take shorthand? are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{of course i went to the muncie, uh, secretarial polytechnic!}

<D>__{well, i just don't know how to thank you, mr. barnes }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{please! norville!}
<A>__{as he reaches to shake:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...it's my pleasure!}
<A>__{she reaches for his hand but norville snatches it away and, winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes wings of his fingers.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...gooooooo eagles!}
<B>__{amy}
<A>__{likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, and, winking back:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{gooooooooo eagles!}
<A>__{but we pull back to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper office, demonstrating the fight sign to smitty, a reporter wearing a fedora with a bent back brim. smitty howls with laughter.}
<C>__{smitty}
<P>__{(wheezing)}
