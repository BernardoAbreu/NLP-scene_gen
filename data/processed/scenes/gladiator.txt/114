<L>__{exterior roman street day}
<A>__{a mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the outskirts of rome. the street is deserted. it seems that almost everyone is at the colosseum. the dog stops. looks up. then a sound is heard. the steady cadence of horses' hooves. the felix regiment rounds a corner. maximus leads the cavalry. he wears lorica segmentata. his corps of archers and soldiers follow. they troop down the dusty street. maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.}
