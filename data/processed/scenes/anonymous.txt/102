<L>__{interior mermaid's tavern night}
<A>__{twenty seven years later. jonson is alone, trying to write at a small table, though it's obvious from his fits and starts and crossing outs that he is having difficulty.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{it's difficult to write, isn't it? after watching something like "hamlet"...}
<A>__{jonson looks up. marlowe sits, uninvited. jonson looks annoyed at the interruption.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{i've seen you watch him. will. during a performance. it eats at you... at your soul...}
<A>__{jonson stares at him, his answer obvious.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{why do you think will hasn't been arrested? you or i make the slightest joke about a nobleman of no consequence, and we find ourselves in a cell quicker than a fart spreads in the trade winds. will he murders a caricature of old william cecil himself, and still whores all the way to westminster and back.}
<C>__{jonson}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{perhaps they haven't noticed..}
<A>__{jonson gets up and walks towards the door.}
<C>__{marlowe}
<D>__{i made sure they did...}
<A>__{jonson turns around.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{you informed on one of your own? to the tower?}
<C>__{marlowe}
<D>__{watch who you judge, ben, for as god is my witness, you may well find yourself doing the same before you meet your maker. we do what we have to, to survive, and survive well, in this life. all of us. and will is definitely not one of us. you know he's illiterate, don't you?}
<A>__{jonson is stunned.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{no? oh, he can read well enough how else could he learn his lines? but the man never actually learned to form his letters.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{why are you here, kit?}
<C>__{marlowe}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{so who did write it? you? no. you'd take credit for it. no...}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{it must be someone who wants their anonymity protected. someone who might even pay to have it protected.}
<A>__{jonson is getting nervous.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{a nobleman.}
<A>__{jonson looks up. marlowe smiles, knowing he is closer to the truth.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{but which? you know, don't you, ben?}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{you've had too much to drink, kit. you're beginning to sound like one of your plays.}
<A>__{jonson stands and hurries out of the tavern.}
