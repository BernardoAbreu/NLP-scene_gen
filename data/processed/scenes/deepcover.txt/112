<L>__{exterior east l.a. street interior car day}
<A>__{elias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to himself at some private joke.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{what are you laughing at?}
<A>__{elias shakes his head: nothing. he laughs. they pull into the lot beside a movie theater.}
<L>__{interior theater day}
<A>__{a technicolor spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. a door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals hull and elias being brought in by a guard and met by molto. molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money satchels, make them wait a moment until... the movie ends. the house lights come on revealing ramon gallegos as the only spectator in the theater. he beckons. molto and the guard bring hull and elias down the aisle to him. gallegos looking in the satchels. a tense moment.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{it isn't one eight.}
<P>__{(off gallegos)}
<D>__{it's a million one. that's all barbosa owed, it's all we're paying.}
<A>__{gallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{big brass balls. collecting money makes you strong.}
<A>__{everybody relaxes. gallegos scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax machine.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{i'm telling our suppliers they got paid. they'll be very happy. i'm happy.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{and we're happy. everybody's happy. it's a happy world.}
<A>__{elias seems a bit mad, but no one minds. he and hull are ready to go. he gestures to molto, wants his gun back.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{so, how can i express my gratitude for a job well done?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{we want barbosa's business.}
<A>__{gallegos gestures to molto to give them the guns.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{done. of course.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{and, also, your business. all this. your money, your dope, everything.}
<A>__{hull looks at elias; what's going on?}
<C>__{gallegos}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you're tougher than i thought, but not that tough.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{how tough is enough?}
<A>__{he brings up the gun and shoots gallegos in the head. hull and the guards are frozen. then everyone goes for a gun. elias shoots the guard. hull has his gun to molto's head and screams at elias:}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{meaning don't shoot him. but elias has no intention of doing so.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{thank you, john. i couldn't have done that without you.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<A>__{he can't believe it: the guy he's been after the whole time is dead on the floor.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{you taught me to take my work seriously.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{what's going on here, david?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{we're taking over.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{you're doing too much stuff.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{no, i'm very clear. i'm very, very clear.}
<P>__{(to molto)}
<D>__{ahora, usted nos assistamos. enteindo?}
<A>__{molto nods.}
