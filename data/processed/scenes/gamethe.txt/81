<A>__{a manhole cover slides aside, schuyler climbs out and helps christine up. it's a short, covered wooden walkway in an alley.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{well, that was pointless... but different... kind of fun...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{mm, a different kind of fun. what's your middle name?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{louise... why?}
<A>__{schuyler points to some graffiti a heart with "svo + clk."}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you're supposed to be here... they picked you for a reason.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{but why?}
<A>__{they start to move shakily down the construction walkway, both bedraggled, covered in goo. handbills cover one wall.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{probably knew you'd play good samaritan for that guy, drag me along but they could have hired an actor for that, less of a risk...}
<A>__{on the wall, a series of handbills say, "aren't you forgetting something?" schuyler puzzles over these as they move, gets to one last one "behind you, stupid." schuyler looks back toward the end of the alley a yellow dumpster with the logo, "consolidated refuse supply" and the smaller image of a key. schuyler moves quickly to it, throws open the lid. angle in dumpster a mountain of shredded paper. schuyler rolls his eyes, sorting through it. christine approaches.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{this is really sick. i think they're trying to fix us up.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{maybe you can't play alone }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{who says i want to play?}
<P>__{(a sigh)}
<D>__{ok, what the fuck are you doing in the dumpster.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{there's something in here i need.}
<A>__{he climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with close a z shaped window crank. sure enough, there's a key embossed on the side. schuyler climbs out again, brandishing the small crank.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i imagine i will find out.}
