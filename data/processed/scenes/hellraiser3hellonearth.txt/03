<L>__{interior carducci's antiques night}
<A>__{the store itself looks like an antique old wood panelling and shelving, victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper. it is grimy, dusty, and dimly lit and apparently unattended. it is packed with merchandise shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through. the stock is a strange surreal mix. discarded items from 50's america (norge fridges, toasters, frankie lymon albums) share space with older items; framed pictures, victorian automata, wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. could that really be an electric chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{he wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances at some items. some he even runs his hands over grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers. but his manner suggests he is looking for something specific. near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows. it is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it.}
<B>__{angle on hoarding}
<A>__{ which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of hyperbolic come ons to long dead punters: you will be amazed! they shouldn't be alive! freaks of nature!}

<D>__{wow ...}
<A>__{revealed is a six foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered in beautifully detailed 3 d carvings all in the same matt black finish as the pillar itself. the pillar is extremely bizarre, as if a new york avant garde sculptor has interpreted a totem pole for jaded modern tastes. the carvings are of dead rats, copulating skeletons, filigree patterned boxes, and faces. one of these faces recognizable to the audience but not to jp is the ossified visage of pinhead, the demon from the first two hellraiser pictures.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom. a voice off startles him.}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{you want it?}
<A>__{jp whirls round in shock. a bum is standing close to him.}
<B>__{angle on bum}
<A>__{he has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard. his eyes are a piercing, excited blue. otherwise he is indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{is it yours?}
<B>__{angle on both}
<A>__{the bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{no. not mine. yours.}
<A>__{jp nods, still a little uncertain.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{how much do you want for it?}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{whatever you think its worth.}
<A>__{jp digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of cash. without counting or checking, he proffers it. the bum's hand flies out and siezes jp's, pressing the money between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp. in the background, out of focus, is pinhead's face on the pillar.}
<C>__{bum }
<D>__{enjoy ...}
<A>__{the focus switches so that the hands in foreground blur and pinhead's frozen face becomes sharp, as if he is silently watching this deal take place. the bum's hand moves away with the money as we}
