<L>__{interior banque real de geneve saurel's office day}
<A>__{jordan, rugrat and donnie drink coffee with saurel and one other swiss banker. it's an impressive office, with an enormous fish tank.}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{we have a joke in america. "heaven is a place where the police are brits, the chefs are italian, the car mechanics are german, the prostitutes are french and the bankers are swiss." i never got it `til now look at those fucking fish! come here, little guy...}
<C>__{saurel}
<D>__{yes, we have the same joke here. only sometimes the english are chauffeurs and the chefs are french. the germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.}
<A>__{polite laughter. jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point:}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.}
<C>__{saurel}
<D>__{excusez moi, jordan, swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit chat before business can be discussed.}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{of course, let's get "down to it." what would you like to know?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an fbi or u.s. justice department investigation?}
<C>__{saurel}
<D>__{ca depend.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{ca depend? ca depend on what?}
<C>__{saurel}
<D>__{whether america plans to invade switzerland in the coming months.}
<C>__{rugrat}
<D>__{want me to see if tanks are rolling down the rue de la croix?}
<A>__{more chuckles. through jordan's forced smile:}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{what i'm asking, you swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.}
<C>__{saurel }
<D>__{i understand perfectly, you american shitheel.}
<A>__{saurel smiles.}
<C>__{saurel}
<D>__{the only way the banque real de geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in switzerland. but there are very few swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties. which is why mr. azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. if the u.s. justice department or fbi or sec or irs sent us a subpoena, it would become papier toillette. we would wipe our ass with it.}
<A>__{everyone's impressed. except jordan.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{unless it was an investigation into stock fraud which is a crime in switzerland. then you'd have to cooperate.}
<C>__{saurel}
<P>__{(now he's impressed)}
<D>__{yes, we would. assuming the account is under your name. however, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...}
<A>__{they take each other in.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{was that yodeling i just heard or did you just say what i thought you said?}
<C>__{saurel }
<D>__{yes! yes!}
<A>__{as the meeting wraps up with handshakes, jordan's v.o. overwhelms saurel's v.o..}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{he was telling me to use a rathole. problem was: sneaking a u.s. rathole into switzerland was a chance i couldn't take. what i needed was somebody with a european passport.}
