<D>__{it's that homer!}
<A>__{muddy is right behind them. he picks up a pillow, off the floor, looking for which bed it belongs on.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{it's that candy, too...}
<A>__{then comes mr. rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in there's no hiding what's going on. homer and candy are caught, their shirts untucked and half unbuttoned they're still out of breath. the pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of which has been stepped on.}
