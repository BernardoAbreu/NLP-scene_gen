<L>__{exterior normandy crater field day}
<B>__{near constant mortar explosions. heavy machine gun fire.}
<A>__{miller's ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of german troops. the americans hug the bottoms of the craters, firing back as best they can. big guns thunder in the distance.}
<T>__{superimposition:}
<D>__{normandy 1300 hours june 9}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{trailed by a radioman, dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge filled crater. he surfaces, sees sarge and reiben, and reels from a horrific smell. their conversation is repeatedly broken by firing and ducking german fire.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jesus christ! what the hell are we swimming in?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{shit, sir.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{fertilizer, captain, i think we're in a cranberry bog.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{look at the bright side, the krauts sure as hell don't want to advance and hold this cesspool.}
<A>__{miller barks to his radioman.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{get fire control, we need some artillery...}
<A>__{radioman trying, sir. more explosions. they all duck. reiben's worried.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{sir, what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{don't worry, we're the only rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into caen.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i care. don't you know what caen's famous for, sarge?}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{frogs?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{lingerie.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yeah? so?}
<A>__{the german fire diminishes for an instant. miller, sarge and reiben immediately rise and pour fire at the german positions. german machine gun fire responds and they duck down again.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{so, you ever heard of employee discounts? my uncle sells shoes, gets twenty five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.}
<B>__{more mortar explosions.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{just picture some french number been spending all day, every day, making cream colored, shear body negligees with gentle lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{lingerie is my life, sir. my mother's got a shop in brooklyn, i grew up in it, from the time i could crawl, we carry caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all i been thinking about since the invasion.}
<A>__{another pause in the german shelling. reiben rises and blasts his b.a.r, then ducks as the germans return fire.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{there's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in caen.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{oh, captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man food, shelter, silk teddies. miller dream on, private.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{happy to, sir.}
<A>__{radioman captain, i've got command, they want you back at h.q., right away.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{maybe the war's over.}
<A>__{a mortar shell explodes very close. after the debris stops falling, sarge and reiben rise, spitting out sludge. reiben looks dubiously at miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i don't think so, captain.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(to radioman)}
<D>__{stay at it until you get fire control.}
<P>__{(to sarge)}
<D>__{keep 'em down, wait for the navy.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{miller waits for a pause in the mortar barrage, then scrambles out of the crater and takes off in a crouch run.}
