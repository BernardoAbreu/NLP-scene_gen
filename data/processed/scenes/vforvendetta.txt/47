<L>__{exterior westminster abbey day}
<A>__{the church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as the final mass of the day has ended. the tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and gossip. church bells toll in the orange dusk above them. helen heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man that we recognize as conrad heyer.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{hello, rosemary. derek, how }
<A>__{helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{derek!}
<A>__{she pushes past conrad, giving derek almond an exuberant kiss on both cheeks.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{darling, how are you? hello, rosemary.}
<A>__{always behind her husband, rosemary almond smiles nervously as she straightens her drab church dress.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it's so good to see you. since this bloody terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the office.}
<A>__{helen pouts at him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, you poor dear.}
<A>__{derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with his lips.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it comes with the job. how are things in the eye, conrad?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{well, we've been working some bugs out of the new mark ix fiber optic network, actually }
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, conrad, don't be such a bloody bore. do tell us about the terrorist, derek. is it true he blew up big ben and the old bailey?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i'm afraid so. we're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case. we'll catch him though. i promise.}
<A>__{helen rubs her white sable against her body.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. aren't you glad you've got such a ruthless, implacable brute for a husband, rosemary?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{yes, well }
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{believe me, you're lucky. you could be struck with a professional peeping tom like conrad. england's highest paid voyeur, aren't you darling?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{helen, i think we'd better }
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh yes, of course. we have to get back so the little pervert can watch what the neighbors do after sunday lunch. he's so exciting.}
<A>__{derek laughs as they climb into their car.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{ciao!}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{goodbye, helen. conrad.}
<A>__{rosemary waves as it pulls off.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{she's a bit hard on him, isn't she?}
<A>__{derek sneers at her.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{until you're half the woman of helen's sophistication, i'd keep your little mouth shut.}
<A>__{he throws the cigarette at her feet.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{really, just look at the way you dress.}
