<A>__{racine sits down hard. he is streaming with sweat under the enormous dead weight. he adjusts the plastic sheet so that edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall. racine gathers his strength and half lifts, half drags the body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a twisted, double headed monster. his flashlight glows from ahead at his destination. in the supply area, racine has dropped edmund's body over some tipped shelves. now he lifts the heavy ceiling beam he spotted earlier. he has to change its angle only two feet in order to let it drop now on edmund's head. racine walks over to the incendiary device. he pulls out the lever and straightens up. as he does he looks down a connecting hallway. he sees movement. he snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway. at the end of the hallway, racine slides to a halt, breathing hard. again he sees the movement. a horrible, sweaty figure confronts him there is a broken mirror attached to the wall. racine looks at himself a long moment and the tension seems to drain away... someone speaks in the shadows!}

<A>__{racine jumps and spins toward the sound, which is only a little more than a moan. his flashlight seeks out the source a ragged bum is stirring in his sleep on a bed of newspapers. he wears an old baseball cap. racine looks at him a long time, trying to decide what to do. he looks back in the direction of the supply area. he looks at the bum settling again into a deep sleep. he looks for one final second at himself in the mirror.}
