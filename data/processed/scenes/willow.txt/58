<A>__{they row across the placid lake toward the island.}
<L>__{exterior island day}
<A>__{they climb onto the rocky shore. flies buzz and swarm around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet. broken skeletons litter the shore. handing the baby back and forth, willow and madmartigan claw their way up to the large tree.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{raziel? hello? fin raziel?}
<A>__{madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{get away! get away!}
<A>__{a littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi ciously at madmartigan, chattering its teeth.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{you'll die! you'll die!}
<A>__{raziel scampers over to willow. her voice screeches like a parrot. she looks like an otter with a bush tail.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{who are you! who are you!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i'm willow ufgood. i'm here to find fin raziel.}
<A>__{she springs right onto willow's chest.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{that's me! raziel! raziel!}
<A>__{willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{this can't be right. this isn't a sorceress. this is some kind of animal.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{queen bavmorda transformed her.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{what do you want!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{we need your help. to take this baby to tir asleen. she's a prin cess.}
<A>__{still sceptical, willow shows raziel the baby's mark. raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks her tail.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{elora danan!}
<A>__{madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree. a flock of birds suddenly screech and fly away. his eyes bulge.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{rool! teemo! you were right! this whole tree is made of gold!!}
<A>__{he strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{fools! you should never have come to this place! we're all going to die!}
<A>__{the wind begins to blow and the sky darkens. raziel zips over to willow and whispers intensely.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{we've got to get off this island right now. hurry! the boat! it's our only chance!}
<A>__{the wind howls. they hurry down to the boat.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{madmartigan!}
<A>__{madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{wait! gold! gold!}
<A>__{waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard. madmarti gan loads up with branches. as they push off, he scrambles down the rocks. just in time he jumps into the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy lake.}
