<L>__{exterior early morning. surf's up wave pool east side}
<A>__{we see the rising sun behind aokee's head as he raises a conch shell and blows it like a horn. he is dressed like a hawaiian prince. as the shot widens it reveals six males and two females dressed in hawaiian native garb. robbie and alex are among several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that provide percussion for the hawaiian war dance.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo.}
<A>__{the drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the hawaiian war dance. the drummers sing the hawaiian folk tune "no ka moku kiakahi ke aloha". there are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison. the male dancers circle each other in time to the beat, gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army. the war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends. at the end, the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout.}
<C>__{concessions girls and boys}
<D>__{concessions! concessions! concessions!}
<A>__{looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50 grounds kids sitting in rows. in our foreground there are six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to them, 2 each. to our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles. the lead kid shouts:}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{company! forward, march.}
<A>__{the drill team marches into full view. the grounds kids behind clap the march beat. the marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<D>__{company! halt!}
<A>__{they do.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<D>__{present arms!}
<A>__{the brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<D>__{company!}
<C>__{marchers}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{order arms.}
<A>__{they begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<D>__{what do you do if it's wet and not yours?}
<C>__{marchers}
<P>__{(in cadence)}
<D>__{don't touch it! don't touch it!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{how do you deal with a full can of trash?}
<C>__{marchers}
<D>__{we empty! we empty!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{marchers}
<D>__{trash rats!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{again!}
<C>__{marchers}
<D>__{trash rats!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{sound off, trash rats.}
<C>__{marchers}
<D>__{trash rats! trash rats!}
<A>__{they stop. their brooms are raised over their heads.}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{company! brooms ho!}
<A>__{they allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. they pull out bright blue ski masks, a la blue man group, and pick up the toilet plungers. the lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<D>__{company! begin!}
<A>__{he counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a blue man stomp like drum routine with the trash cans. two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). these become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. a competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. they pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. they begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo.}
<C>__{lead marcher }
<P>__{(to the seated grounds kids)}
<D>__{what do you do when the table's a mess?}
<C>__{grounds kids}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{we wipe it! we wipe it!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{what do you do when a toilet's stopped up?}
<C>__{grounds kids}
<D>__{we plunge it! we plunge it!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{grounds kids}
<D>__{trash rats!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{sound off!}
<C>__{grounds kids}
<D>__{trash rats!}
<C>__{lead marcher}
<D>__{sound off trash rats!}
<C>__{grounds kids}
<D>__{trash rats! trash rats!}
<A>__{they clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit. all is quiet now. we see concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting. everyone is looking around. suddenly two lifeguards dressed as roman soldiers appear with horns. they bellow a roman call to action, and two roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards. first we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching. they are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals. she is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter. next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying cowboy, who is sitting up on a first aid backboard. he is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously cesar. on the backboard is also the surfer king trophy. they all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that cowboy has a good view of the gladiators. the drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators. the simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. the victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to cowboy for a yea or nay. cowboy generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. the seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout.}
<C>__{lifeguards}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{lifeguards! lifeguards! lifeguards!}
<A>__{the guards holding cowboy set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone.. cowboy picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform. he sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully. we see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "water world welcomes employee olympians". cowboy moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks.}
<C>__{cowboy}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{let the games...begin!}
<A>__{the seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. we see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as judges. they nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards. we see big mike near them, smiling broadly.}
