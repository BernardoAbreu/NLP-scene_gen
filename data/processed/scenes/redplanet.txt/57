<A>__{gallagher and burchenal sit on rocks nearby. not exerting themselves. checking their monitors.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{maybe we got what we deserved. we ignored science and truth on one planet and poisoned it beyond repair. then tried to get science to save us on another. maybe it's the inconsistency that did us in.}
<A>__{burchenal points at a depression a few hundred yards away.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<P>__{(then; points)}
<D>__{that's what they call the datum. sea level. if there was a sea. or when there was a sea, that's where it was. you can tell 'cause the sand was created by what's called the fluvial process where water breaks rocks into smaller and smaller pieces. we're the first men on mars. even if it isn't gonna last long.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{would you rather i shut up so you can die quietly?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{nah, you can keep talking. it's kinda peaceful.}
<A>__{in the b.g., headed towards a ridge of rocks, we can see a lone figure making its way along. it's pettengill. he steps around the ridge. we can hear his radio whooosh to static as he loses line of sight communication with the others. up ahead of him, standing on the edge of an enormous drop off, just staring out into space, is santen. his back is to us. pettengill walks towards him. santen still doesn't hear. santen's radio is off. beethoven blares in his helmet. a 3000 foot drop at his feet. it is magnificent. as pettengill approaches and santen remains unaware, the scene seems less and less innocuous. we fear for him. until... pettengill just walks right up beside him and stares out at the chasm as well. santen lowers his music. they stand there silently for a moment. santen has some kind of weak ass epiphany...}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry. i owe you an apology. i've been a dick. i pick on people who are weaker than i am.}
<A>__{it's way too little, way too late. but pettengill doesn't let on. just nods. as if he's forgiven him. steps away and out of frame. we hold on santen a moment and...pettengill has picked up what would be a 250 pound rock back on earth and is heaving it with all his might into santen from behind. it slams into him, bending him in half, knocking his feet out from under him. for half a moment we think santen might regain his footing. but he doesn't. he starts to fall past the edge of the cliff. slowly. in .38 grav slow motion. flailing. twisting in the air. as he falls, looking up, he slaps off the music, the radio comes back on. pettengill leans over the edge.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{fuck you. fuck you. i'm gonna die. but i'm gonna spend the next five minutes of my life completely satisfied knowing i killed you.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{no, you won't, because...}
<A>__{pettengill shakes his head and steps back out of the line of sight. santen's last taunt turns to static.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{yes, i will.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away.}
