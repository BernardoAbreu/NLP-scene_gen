<L>__{int: apartment building, bridge square, room night}
<A>__{lilly being embraced by edgar, she can't do anything. then a loud crash on the door, as if someone is trying to break in. edgar stops feeding, stares at lilly. beat.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you're so strong.}
<A>__{then another crash on the door. edgar drops lilly. he propels himself towards a ventilation grill on the wall. cut to jones and the cops kicking the door in. it swings open to show lilly on the floor. jones stoops down.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{lilly!}
<A>__{jones gets close to lilly, starts squeezing the side of her neck, trying to stop the arterial blood from squirting her life away.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh shit shit.}
<A>__{dominic enters and sees the scene. he yells into his rt.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{lilly's hurt. she's hurt!}
<A>__{the other cops are now scanning the room. meanwhile dominic has found the ventilation shaft, blood smeared around the opening.}
<C>__{dominic}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's in the ventilation shaft!}
<A>__{jones then stares down at lilly pressing one hand against the wound. close on lilly, going into shock. she's shivering.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{she's dying! she's fucking dying!}
<A>__{at that moment silus appears at the door. silus stares at lilly, bleeding to death in jones' arms. silus immediately bends to her. with his free hand jones pulls out a vicious knife which he points at silus.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{get away from her!}
<A>__{but silus ignores the knife and moves closer to lilly.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{get away or i will stick you!}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{do you want me to save her?}
<A>__{jones wavers.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she is dying.}
<A>__{jones backs the knife away. silus whips his hand to the blade of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood immediately issuing from the wound. he presses his bleeding wrist to lilly's mouth. at first resistant, lilly begins to suck at the wrist. jones is appalled. silus then leans close to lilly and whispers in her ear. all the other noises in the soundtrack drop out.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lilly. stop fighting now. fall back, fall back...}
<A>__{slowly she does. silus removes his wrist from lilly's mouth. she is silent, comatose. a medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past silus and the bloody jones and begin to work on lilly. for a moment silus and jones stare at each other. then silus turns to the ventilation shaft in the corner. he closes his eyes. listens.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{he's getting away!!}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{the cops are silent. stare at silus who opens his eyes.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's going up.}
<A>__{we move in on silus' ear. closer, closer. into his ear.}
