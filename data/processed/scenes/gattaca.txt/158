<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{i have your samples ready.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{have you forgotten? i don't need any samples where i'm going.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(meeting jerome's gaze)}
<D>__{no, but you might need them when you get back.}
<A>__{eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door. the water vapor billows out. jerome regards eugene. eugene leads jerome inside for the first time. inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators. they contain thousands of blood and urine specimens. jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{everything you need to last you two lifetimes.}
<A>__{eugene points out an extra specimen of semen in the first refrigerator.}

<P>__{(afterthought)}

<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{i got the better end of the deal. i just lent you my body you lent me your dream.}
