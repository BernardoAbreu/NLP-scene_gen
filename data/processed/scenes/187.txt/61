<L>__{interior principal garcia's office afternoon}
<A>__{a wall air conditioner... blows on stevie and cesar's sweaty backs. trevor enters, shirt equally drenched in sweat. the dead silence is like that of a courtroom. mr. garcia, late forties, drawn, sits behind his desk... mr. hyland, stands in the outer office behind a glass partition, head lowered. hyland flashes trevor a defeated smile as we... trevor coolly deciphers the situation. garcia reaches down, switches on a portable tape recorder.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{you don't mind if i tape record our conversation. matter of record. you understand.}
<P>__{(indicating mr. hyland)}
<D>__{of course, you know mr. hyland.}
<A>__{trevor weighs the situation. nods.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{am i being questioned?}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mr. sanchez and mr. littleton tell me you've accused them of stealing your watch. if that's the case, i need to address the accusation.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... for the record, i primarily suspect mr. sanchez. although i wouldn't be surprised if stevie was an accomplice.}
<P>__{(glances over at cesar and stevie)}
<D>__{beginning of sixth period, cesar admired the watch. i believe his exact words were, 'can i have it?'}
<P>__{(looks back to garcia)}
<D>__{either way, i'd like my watch back.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{when i asked him to empty his pockets, cesar refused.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{is that true, mr. sanchez?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{no way. he never asked me nothin' like that! i don't go 'round taxing no teachers...}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{okay. calm down.}
<A>__{with fervor now, cesar turns his pockets inside out, emptying the contents (house keys and two dollars in change) onto garcia's desk.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{... i ain't got no watch, man.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{mr. littleton, may we see your pockets too?}
<A>__{stevie empties his pockets now. nothing but a twenty dollar bill and an empty pack of marlboros. trevor just stares at him.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(last try)}
<D>__{i'd like a locker search, please.}
<A>__{garcia hesitates, now looks to cesar and stevie...}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{you're excused, gentlemen. take your things. thank you.}
<A>__{the boys collect their belongings off garcia's desk and shoot looks at trevor as they exit. now garcia turns back to trevor...}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<P>__{(unflinching pragmatism)}
<D>__{... let me try and explain something. i try and think of our students here at john quincy adams like they're my clients. i can't accuse anybody just on your hunches. i need more than that. i need facts.}
<P>__{(looking at hyland)}
<D>__{i won't have another law suit like we did with that blackwell case.}
<P>__{(now to trevor)}
<D>__{boy's mother spent $400 that she couldn't afford on new clothes for her son. unfortunately we considered the clothing gang attire and sent the boy home. that cost the district a quarter of a million dollars.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so i want you to be straight with me, mr. garfield. did you physically see cesar take your watch?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no, i didn't...}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{do you have any witnesses who saw him take it?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{... no.}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{unless there's reasonable cause to show that cesar, or mr. littleton took your watch then i can't authorize a locker search. i'm sorry. any concerns regarding my decision, you can look up in the handbook. it's section 628.1 of the education code.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(to garcia)}
<D>__{that was my grandfather's watch. can't you see what they're doing? weren't you ever a teacher?}
<C>__{mr. garcia}
<D>__{afraid i never had the privilege. teaching and being a principal don't necessarily go hand in hand, mr. garfield.}
<A>__{off trevor's defeated gaze...}
