<A>__{frances marches across it. everyone stares.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!...}
<A>__{when she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them all, grandiloquently.}
<L>__{interior frances' hotel room night}
<A>__{she's snoring in bed. face down, spread eagled. the light is on. a whiskey bottle (three quarters empty), a tumbler (three quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table. the phone rings. she winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over. her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{the phone keeps ringing. her arm gropes for it. a loud pounding at the door.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{hold on!}
<P>__{(answering phone)}
<D>__{hello...}
<P>__{(we hear a dial tone)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the pounding at the door becomes violent. someone's breaking it down.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the door splinters.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what...? help!}
<A>__{men stream into the room. back lit from the hall they look like monsters, phantoms. they're carrying sticks. frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{don't kill me! don't kill me!}
<A>__{she slams the door on the advancing figures.}
