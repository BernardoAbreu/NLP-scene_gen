<L>__{interior woods morning}
<A>__{edward and bella tramp through the woods to find jacob leaning against a tree. his expression is hard.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're still alive.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i've been calling you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{couldn't drop by?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{he thinks i'm keeping you away.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(spinning on him)}
<D>__{stay the hell out of my head!}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{dad grounded me, jake. we're trying to get back before he wakes up.}
<A>__{jacob doesn't buy it. bella is frustrated. but edward takes a step toward jacob. calm. diplomatic.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{jacob, i know you have something to say to me, but i'd like to say something first. alright?}
<A>__{jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{thank you. for keeping bella alive when i... didn't.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, you didn't. and it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i know. i'm still grateful.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{but i'm back now. and i'm not leaving bella's side till she orders me away.}
<A>__{she looks at him. he returns the look. jacob sees the devotion between them. it wounds him. but he masks it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{either way, we'll handle victoria from here on out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she's been laying low. ever since your freaky sister showed up. guess she can't stand you cullens either.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{she'll come back.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she does, she's ours. she killed on our turf.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{my turn to talk. i'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(reads his thoughts, nods)}
<D>__{i haven't forgotten.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what? what key point?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if any of them bites a human, the truce is over. that's bite, not kill.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{but... if i choose it, it's none of your business.}
<A>__{jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you... what!? no. no way. i won't let you }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{ bella, step back }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're not gonna be one of them.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's not your call }
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(even more intense)}
<D>__{you know what we'll do to you i won't have a choice }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{we're done here }
<A>__{edward takes bella's arm, starts to pull her away. jacob lunges, trying to extract bella from him }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't speak for her!}
<A>__{edward pushes jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air, but mid air he phases into a wolf! the jacob wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face edward in an attack stance. edward shifts stance, as well, readying for a fight }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{edward and jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging }
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(to bella)}
<D>__{get out of here. now!}
<A>__{but bella races between them, forceful, insistent.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(to both of them)}
<D>__{you do this, you'll be going through me.}
<A>__{a long tense beat, none of them backing down it could go either way }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i swear to god, i'm not moving.}
<A>__{both rivals see she's dead serious. edward backs off, ever so slightly... the jacob wolf does the same.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(turning to edward)}
<D>__{give me a second. please.}
<A>__{edward shakes his head. doesn't move an inch.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{read his thoughts. is he going to hurt me?}
<A>__{edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. but his eyes never leave the wolf's. they glare at one another. bella carefully approaches the jacob wolf, blocking his line of sight. her voice is kind, pleading.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{jacob, i love you. you're my best friend. but... i can't change how i feel. please don't make me choose.}
<P>__{(quietly, emotionally)}
<D>__{because it'll be him. it's always been him.}
<A>__{anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face. it's even harder to take than when he's in human form }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{but you know how important you are to }
<A>__{suddenly, the wolf bolts out of there... on bella fighting tears as she watches him disappear...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{there were problems ahead. seemingly insurmountable...}
<A>__{edward's arms wrap around her from behind.}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{... if i didn't become a vampire, the volturi would kill me. if i did, my best friend would do the job himself, or get killed in the attempt.}
<A>__{she turns to face edward, looking into his loving eyes...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone i loved in danger...}
<A>__{he kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{but i'd already survived the worst losing edward. so i knew i could survive anything...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm here. always.}
<A>__{and she sees that's the truth, believes it. he takes her hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{and soon, i'd be like him. we'd face our fate together. forever.}
<A>__{off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to }
