<L>__{interior munson house cellar night}
<A>__{the men all sit around the card table, lit from below by an oil lamp. the general is neatly packing the stacks of banknotes into the sackbutt case.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{motherfuck!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes. unfortunately, mrs. munson has rather complicated the situation }
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{i know how to discomplicate it! put a cap in the old lady's head! then everything simple again!}
<A>__{the group lapses into silence, considering. even gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed. the professor is solemn:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...not easy to do. many reasons. practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town. reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood. no, gawain; would that it were simple!}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{well fuck, man! what we gonna do, give the money back and go to church?!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i shudder. i quake.}
<A>__{he turns to the general.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...you sir, are a buddhist. is there not a middle way?}
<A>__{the general grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt case full of money:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{must float like a leaf on the river of life. and kill old lady.}
<A>__{the men murmur.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well... i suppose you are right. it is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. but, think a moment look at the other tools we have at hand.}
<A>__{he looks around.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...we have the cellar. we have masonry and trowel. perhaps we could simply... immure her.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{sure, easiest thing in the world. i could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, mountain has a source for the manacles...}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... no, i fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. no... no... shortest and most painless is best. let us confront reality. gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. the only question is... who wields the weapon.}
<A>__{he looks around the table. silence. no volunteers.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...i believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, sure, fair enough.}
<A>__{he takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and snaps a handful of its bristles.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...i'm thinking, though, that since i lost my finger i mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat maybe i should be excused from this thing. hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway }
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{you one whiney motherfucker! i squeeze your nutsack you keep that up!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{listen, punk }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{gentlemen, no special pleading, no exceptions. it's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused.}
<A>__{pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, and then hands the four long and one short to the professor:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, okay... it was just a trial balloon...}
<A>__{with a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and encloses them in one hand. sweaty close ups. each man stares at the straws. some hesitant, some resolute, they draw: first, the general: long straw. his reaction: impassive. next, lump: long straw. his reaction: relieved. next, pancake. long straw.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{long straw. you all see it. all your fuss over nothing, punk.}
<A>__{two straws left. gawain stares at them, licks his lips. he reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...motherfucker...}
<A>__{he touches the other straw, hesitates. he goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, closes his eyes, and pulls. he lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed shut eyes, raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look: short straw. the professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he holds the last long one. gawain moans.}
