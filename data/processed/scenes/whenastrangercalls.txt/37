<L>__{interior bar late afternoon closeup duncan}
<A>__{sitting at his table inside the bar. he takes a long, noisy drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks. it tastes good, being the first real drink he's had in over six years. but duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully. his eyes are ever restlessly, suspiciously moving about.}
<B>__{angle on bar}
<A>__{as bill walks up and stands next to tracy. hank moves off to get bill another beer. tracy looks up at bill and smiles. as regulars at the same bar, they are loose and comfortable with each other.}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{a little action for your game?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}

<D>__{i wouldn't bet against you.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's the matter? you don't like me playing with myself?}
<A>__{tracy grimaces as hank comes back with bill's beer. bill picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to hank and heads back to the pool table. closeup duncan as his eyes follow bill to the pool table, then come back to tracy at the bar. pov duncan looking at the back of tracy. she reaches into her purse.}
<B>__{on tracy}
<A>__{she takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse. she pulls out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her lips. o.s. we hear the sound of a match being struck.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match. he shoves it forward at her. it goes out. duncan fumbles for another match as tracy regards him with undisguised repulsion. duncan gets the second match lit and holds it out for her. she accepts the favor and lights her cigarette. duncan smiles. tracy nods and turns away. duncan is still holding the burning match for her to blow out. as it doesn't look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the floor. reaction shot bartender he gives a look as if to say, "jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo". two shot duncan and tracy pause. duncan is still smiling at her.}

<D>__{thanks for the light. okay?}
<A>__{the englishman sits down beside her, but doesn't look at her. tracy looks away too, determined to ignore him, not to let him get into her space. duncan coughs. after a long moment, he turns back to her.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{next round's on me.}
<A>__{tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead, acknowledging nothing. pause. duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the bar, staring at her. tracy turns to him:}

<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{see, that's the whole pointerior my mind... your mind... where do they fit in? you know what i mean?}

<B>__{angle on elderly couple}
<A>__{they are watching this little spectacle with growing curiosity.}
<B>__{angle on duncan}
<A>__{still looking at her. by pointing at what she has, he orders two more drinks from the bartender. when they arrive, he takes a big swallow from one, picks up the other, stands, moves down the bar and sits beside tracy again.}

<A>__{tracy has clammed up her elbows on the bar, head between her elbows, arms covering her ears, hands clasped behind her neck. duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:}

<P>__{(rapidly)}
<D>__{listen, i didn't mean nothin'. i don't live around here. see ?}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{i think the lady wants to be left alone.}
<A>__{duncan looks up. bill enters the frame and stands in front of tracy, confronting duncan. closeup duncan looking up at bill, his eyes red, his gaze unsteady.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{the air is charged with tension.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think an apology is in order.}
<A>__{duncan doesn't know how to handle this. he looks at bill, half shrugs, half smiles.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that the best you can do?}
<A>__{duncan looks away. a long moment passes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think you'd better just move along, pal.}

<D>__{no! i want him out of here!}
<A>__{the bartender steps back, deciding to mind his own business. tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further down the bar.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to duncan)}
<D>__{go on, beat it.}
<A>__{they glare at each other. the longer duncan sits there without moving, without saying anything, the angrier bill gets.}

<A>__{as the tension builds.}
<B>__{angle on bar}
<A>__{duncan looks away.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm not going to say it again, mister.}
<A>__{duncan reaches for his drink, but bill reacts quicker. with a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it shatters on the floor behind the bar. duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. after a long moment, duncan coughs. then he turns and looks at bill. he purses his lips. it looks like a nervous facial movement. then suddenly, duncan spits at bill, hitting him square in the face. before anyone can register what's happened, bill lunges at duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the floor. the fight is fast, vicious and one sided from the very start. pinned to the floor on his back, duncan flails his arms ineffectually like a panicked insect as bill holds him in place with a left handed grip on the collar while his powerful right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into duncan's face time and time again. duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes from this brutal spectacle. hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing a number. he turns away from the fight to talk. then, as suddenly as bill first sprang at duncan, he leaps to his feet and turns to the bar. he reaches over and grabs the phone from hank, slamming it down into the cradle.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{who're you calling?}
<A>__{bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his face off. he snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles on a shelf behind the bar. hank quickly hands him a bottle. bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. he is still charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself. as bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, tracy stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the door behind her.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{you're welcome, baby!}
<A>__{then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns and, standing over duncan's inert form, empties half the bottle onto him. he sets the bottle back on the bar. he grabs duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and throws him into the alley where duncan falls in a heap. bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another drink.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to hank)}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. at the wife's silent insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{good riddance to bad rubbish, eh, bill?}
<A>__{bill doesn't answer and the couple quietly leave.}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{a fight breaks out, there's gonna be damages. insurance company doesn't pay without a police report...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you see any damages?}
<A>__{hank lowers his gaze to the floor. bill finishes his drink. he is still very hopped up. he pulls a few dollars from his wallet and drops them on the counter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{see ya 'round.}
<A>__{he turns and strides out of the bar. camera holds for a beat on hank alone now in his empty establishment. the phone starts to ring, presumably the police calling back. after several rings, hank picks up the phone and listens.}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no, it's over now...}
