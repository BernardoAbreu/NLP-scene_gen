<L>__{interior printing plant day}
<A>__{the murder scene. no sound.}
<T>__{a series of shots:}
<A>__{a body from the waist down in the claws of six foot working robotic. the tattooed covered legs swing back and forth like a pendulum. the torso is wedged in between two enormous printing rollers. the head is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt. it's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun to congeal. we slowly track past ich, charlie, and nick, watching. charlie has the dry heaves. real sound as we reveal the full crime scene. instead of the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter, there is order and quiet. a slow underwater dance.}
<B>__{inspector ohashi}
<A>__{quietly gives an order. someone turns off the robotic. the severed legs stop swinging. nick, charlie and ich walk over to ohashi. ich bows deeply. ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to a man holding a tape measurer.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{could you fill me in?}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{why don't you ask your chief detective?}
<A>__{ich looks down at the floor.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{because i want you to tell me.}

<D>__{excellent, officer matsumoto. how is your investigation going?}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{well, sir. thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with these distinguished gentlemen.}
<A>__{he bows. it's pathetic.}
<C>__{police lieutenant}
<D>__{looking for clues in the bottom of a sake bottle, matsumoto?}
<A>__{laughter all around.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<D>__{he's an officer of great distinction.}
<A>__{another sarcastic dig. ich stoically stands and takes it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, ich has been helpful.}
<C>__{ohashi}
<P>__{(ignoring him, to nick)}
<D>__{have you changed your mind and decided to go home, detective?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{not until one of us bags kobo.}
<P>__{(looking at the corpse)}
