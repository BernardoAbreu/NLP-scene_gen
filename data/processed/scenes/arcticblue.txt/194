<A>__{a pall hangs over the town. people know to stay inside. time crawls by. in his house, neff, for once, has his tv turned off. he tries to read and listens for sounds outside. in the spa, water drips somewhere. all the stalls are empty. in his sod house, kenai looks out his one tiny window at the curtain of snow. dixie comes up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders. he looks up at her, glum. in wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about as if expecting his imminent return. in the rental cabin, eric checks his watch. 10:45 am.}
