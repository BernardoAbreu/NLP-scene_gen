<L>__{interior caliber vault day}
<A>__{the main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it were blown up from the inside. on the floor is the still smoldering body of the security guard. the room is incredibly smokey. zed squeezes through the opening. then, eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke with a brick sized bar of pure gold.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{look at it! we're all rich!}
<A>__{the smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked onto it. eric starts laughing.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we're rich!}
<A>__{zed looks at him like he's crazy.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we're rich!}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{we're not out of here yet.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yes but we're rich!}
<A>__{zed takes a seat at the vault door. the backside of a vault door looks like an incredibly intricate clock. zed removes the plexiglass shielding.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm going to show the others.}
<A>__{he squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold. zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points.}
