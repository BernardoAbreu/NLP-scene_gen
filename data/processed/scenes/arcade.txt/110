<L>__{exterior dante's inferno dawn}
<A>__{outside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world. alex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out as the sun returns. she points and laughs. we begin to rise up, as nick and the others join them. everyone is laughing now. it's uncontrollable. this is positive. life affirming. and hell, we should probably wrap this thing up on that note. we should... ...but we won't.}
<B>__{we watch}
<A>__{as a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit, until only our original group is left.}
<B>__{the group}
<A>__{as they make their way down the street and away from the inferno.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so how did you do it, alex?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, it's a long story...}
<A>__{alex catches nick's eye briefly, and he smiles. whatever happened between them is over now. friends again. suddenly alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over her face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i just thought of something. if we came back from the game...}
<P>__{(turning to nick)}
<D>__{...what if arcade did too?}
<A>__{a beat as the group mulls it over. then greg shakes his head.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{nah. you won, right? you played by the rules.}
<A>__{greg's right. alex grins and dismisses the thought.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{okay. forget i ever said it.}
<A>__{the group moves away from us once more.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{so start at the beginning...}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{give her a chance, will you?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{i am giving her a chance. why don't you get off my back?}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{guys...}
