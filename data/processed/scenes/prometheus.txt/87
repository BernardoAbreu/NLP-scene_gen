<A>__{janek stands on the bridge, looking out at the fading light. a towering wall of cloud rushes over the horizon. a storm front rolls across the holographic globe.}
<L>__{interior pyramid lower passage}
<A>__{david and watts keep searching. their communicators crackle.}
<C>__{janek }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{watts. we've got another storm front coming in. looks like it follows the sunset line. if you're coming in you'd better do it now.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i see light.}
<A>__{watts squints into the darkness. she sees nothing.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{janek, hang on...}
<A>__{she sees it. a dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway. she runs forward finds holloway staggering blearily toward her, leaning on the wall. his helmet and most of his gear are missing; only his chest lamp shines.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{we've got him!}
<P>__{(to holloway)}
<D>__{martin! where's your helmet?}
<A>__{he's disoriented: he stares at her face for a moment before she registers. his teeth chatter. he's freezing.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{broken. i fell. little...disoriented. i've just been...}
<A>__{he waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him. david removes his own helmet. fits it over holloway's head.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{here. i can do without this.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{let's get you home.}
