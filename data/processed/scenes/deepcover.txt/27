<L>__{interior lewazz night}

<D>__{how's it going, john?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i'm in there.}
<A>__{without being asked, she sets him up a dry sack with a long red straw. (note: he never touches the drink.) hull's appearance has continued to change. his clothes have become flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee. eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts.}

<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{pina colada times two and a white wine.}

<B>__{a table}
<A>__{where he rejoins a white man, david elias (30s, slick, powerful) and a well dressed black woman (mid 20s, good looking). she gets the wine. elias rises to let her out. as the woman passes hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry. he's struck. her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.}
