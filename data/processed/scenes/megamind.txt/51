<L>__{interior hal's apartment morning}
<A>__{hal lies in the same position we left him last night. he sits up and grabs his head. he looks like he has the worst hangover in the world. finally, he remembers last night. he looks around, but not really sure what he's looking for.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{man...}
<A>__{shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. he pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. it's empty. as if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself. he shakes the thought from his mind.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. hal's face he stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. the inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. a content look washes over his face. there is a distinct sound of porcelain cracking and}
<B>__{splintering.}
<A>__{the sound intensifies. hal looks down to see his urine stream}
<B>__{smashing the toilet.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{he whips his stream away only to cut a long rip in the wall.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{he freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.}
<C>__{hal }
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{he aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole. he sees his downstairs neighbor sitting at his breakfast table. he has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes.}
