<A>__{the applause continues. margo sits back in her chair now, picking at a bit of fingernail polish...}
<C>__{margo's voice}
<D>__{bill's welcoming home birthday party... a night to go down in history. like the chicago fire or the massacre of the huguenots. even before the party started, i could smell disaster in the air...}
<L>__{interior margo's bedroom night}
<A>__{the same night as the previous sequence, but before the party has started. margo is all dressed except for jewelry. she stands before her dressing table putting it on. she sips at an enormous martini...}
<C>__{margo's voice}
<D>__{i knew it, i sensed it even as i finished dressing for that blasted party...}
<A>__{birdie comes in.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{you all put together?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{my back's open.}
<P>__{(birdie goes to work on it)}
<D>__{did the extra help get here?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{there's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. who'd you call the william morris agency?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you're not being funny, i could get actors for less. what about the food?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres }
<P>__{(she zips margo)}
<D>__{voila.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that french ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?}
<C>__{birdie}

<P>__{(she starts tidying the room)}
<D>__{there's a message from the bartender. does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests.}
<P>__{(birdie cackles)}
<D>__{they're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's bill? he's late.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{late for what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't be dense. the party.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{i ain't dense. and he's been here twenty minutes.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well, i certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...}
