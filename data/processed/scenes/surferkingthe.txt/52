<L>__{exterior morning the next day thunder bay}
<A>__{we see thunder bay looking east. aokee and alex are setting up lawn chairs. aokee is lathering on suntan lotion, and puts on a large straw hat. alex puts sun block cream on his nose, and they both sit on the lawn chairs. they both have large smoothies. robbie appears with his surfboard, and lays it up against the east fence at thunder bay. pipeman arrives carrying a small device in a plastic ziplock bag. robbie approaches pipeman.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{hi! glad you could make it.}
<P>__{(pointing to pipeman's hand)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{this is how i trigger the wave.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{with that? a garage door clicker?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{what did you think? waves just happen? this is colorado, kid. now get your board and get in the water.}
<A>__{robbie gets his board and jumps into thunder bay, paddling over to the narrow side where the wave begins. pipeman goes down the stairs leading to near where robbie has positioned himself.}
<C>__{pipeman }
<D>__{you sure that's where you want to be?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{should be about right. aren't you getting in? where's your board?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{mentors don't get wet. i looked it up.}
<P>__{(pressing the clicker)}
<D>__{get ready.}
<A>__{a wave comes and robbie begins paddling. he misses it, splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again. aokee and alex look at each other nervously.}
<C>__{pipeman }
<D>__{want to know what you did wrong?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(mad)}
<D>__{just gimme another wave.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{oakey doakey.}
<A>__{another wave comes. robbie paddles furiously and misses it again. now he's really angry.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(tersely)}
<D>__{okay. please. tell me what i did wrong.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{you're in the wrong position. the wave doesn't crest that soon. move ten feet further away from the back wall.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{the ocean never had a back wall.}
<P>__{(to pipeman)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{robbie paddles over to the spot suggested by pipeman. aokee and alex are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. it comes and robbie catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. he has a good run and kicks out at the end. aokee and alex high five.}
<C>__{alex and aokee}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{yeee haww.}
<A>__{they settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun.}
