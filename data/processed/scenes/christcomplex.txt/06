<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ accurate account of events... the story of your romantic life }
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{ unfair. because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{who else is going to do it? we're alone in the universe. if we are going to make it through this "crazy world" we need to look out for each other.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i think you use atheism and the whole "we are alone in the universe" jive to justify your actions.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i regret taking you to see dawkins because you use that as a fall back to be codependent.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{first of all you are bitter about the whole dawkins thing, because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ you didn't even know the first thing about "the god delusion" until i gave you a copy }
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{ and someone who was huge supporter turns her back because richard dawkins didn't like her nipple piercing }
<C>__{anna}

<D>__{ enjoy your suite in hell non believer }
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(more banter)}
<D>__{ enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter. how about you pray to thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so i can be removed from this asinine conversation.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're hiding behind this religious debate because you don't want to admit you have always gravitated toward the "wrong type" of guy.}
<A>__{zoey is staring off into space.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(detached)}
<D>__{i actually stopped listening to you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you staring at?}
<A>__{zoey points at quinn and louis, who are fighting with tree limbs in the distance.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{who are those guys?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the one closest to us is quinn. very weird, socially awkward type of guy. i don't know who his friend is.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know. looks like that stuff my ex rob was into }
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{oh that medieval rugby style game }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ yeah the made up sport from "blood of heroes"...oh...jugger! }
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{ sounds pornographic.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so quinn? what else do you know about him?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh no you don't! this is exactly what i was talking about!}
<A>__{anna senses something in zoey that she is trying to hide.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{wait a second? you've already established contact with quinn?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what is this mi 6?}
