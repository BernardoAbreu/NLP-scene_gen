<L>__{interior gymnasium, forrester high school day}
<A>__{josh's students scuffle about on stadium seating, arranging themselves for a class photo. they're not doing a great job. a male photographer does his best to compose them, not doing a great job of hiding his bitterness about the fact that he's shooting school photos instead of vanity fair spreads.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{okay, face the front ladies and gentlemen...come on...hold still...}
<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
<D>__{i'm trying to record the peak of your pathetic lives here.}
<A>__{josh stands off to the side, lost in his own thoughts. tired.}
<C>__{photographer }
<D>__{mr. lambert, would you like to step in please?}
<A>__{josh snaps out of his own head.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{uh...what?}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{could you step in so that we can take the photo? quickly please.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{just take it without me.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{we need you in the photo, sir.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{no, you don't. just take the damn photo without me, okay?}
<A>__{the class settles down, shocked by the outburst. chastened, the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera trigger.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{i can't believe this is my life.}
<P>__{(beat; to class)}
<D>__{ready kids? say asshole teacher!}
