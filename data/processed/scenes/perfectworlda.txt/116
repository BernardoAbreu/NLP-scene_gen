<A>__{silence. nobody seems willing to play along. red turns from the window to sally.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{how'd ya' kill him?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{shot him with a pistol. there was always one around the dance hall. that's what they called it but it was a whorehouse. we lived there.}
<A>__{red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the airstream, staring out the front window.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{what'd the authorities do?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{the victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet cajun style.}

<C>__{sally}

<P>__{(tired of the game)}
<D>__{shit. 'caus' i'm runnin' and they're chasin' and i'd jus' as soon go north as south as east as west. it's a fun lil' parlor game, lady, but right now butch haynes don't have the slightest idea where he's headed!}
