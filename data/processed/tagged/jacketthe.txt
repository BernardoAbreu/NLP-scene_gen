<D>__{written by massy tadjedin based on a screenplay by marc rocco april 15, 2003}
<A>__{a pure white screen. idyllic stillness. all of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to. after some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's p.o.v. then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man.}

<D>__{i was 25 years old the first time i died...}
<L>__{interior hospital, kuwait, day}
<A>__{one more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from william starks' p.o.v. the chaos of the hospital around him as doctors and nurses tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers. our glimpse of starks reveals a red stretcher soaked in blood and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull. then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does the pace of the world around him.}
<L>__{interior hospital, kuwait, day}
<C>__{william starks }
<D>__{i remember there was so much white everywhere. and i felt peace...even though there was war around me. and i felt alive, even though i knew i was dead. intern #1 come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here.}
<A>__{an intern, clipboard in hand, stands above starks' unmoving body with another intern (2) beside him. intern 1 pulls the rest of the sheet off of starks as the other searches for his dog tags and gently closes his eyes with her hand.}
<D>__{intern #2 [reading from the tags] starks, william. born december 25, intern #1 wait, so how old? intern #2 intern #1 [searching through records] here he is. william starks. born in vermont. he hasn't got a family listed. the naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him.}
<A>__{as the intern puts the tags back down, she meets starks' wide open eyes now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life. she stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, starks blinks and a tear runs down his cheek jarring her.}
<D>__{intern #2 [calling out] oh my god! this soldier is alive! code blue! code blue! this man just blinked! intern #1 he's been tagged already. worry about the others... [then seeing starks blink] oh shit! shit! code blue! we need a doctor! get a doctor over here now!}

<D>__{have you lost any men today, captain?}
<C>__{captain medley}
<D>__{no. one of my corporals took a bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it. looks that way...}
<T>__{flashback to:}
<L>__{exterior iraqi village, day}
<A>__{we see only the hand, and not the man to whom it belongs, enter the frame and pull the trigger on a gun. the sound pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of starks' head in a flash, shaving the skin around it right off.}
<L>__{exterior american naval hospital, day}
<A>__{starks convalesces in a navy hospital bed his head heavily bandaged and his arms suited with i.v.'s and dressings as a major, a lieutenant and a doctor stand above him. starks' face now cleaned of the blood that masked it before is alert, and striking. even with the bandages, he remains well built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.}

<D>__{sergeant starks was very lucky. a little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out...}

<D>__{it's hard to say. sergeant starks could have retrograde amnesia or... [lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression. it's very common with traumas like this. starks [cutting him off] sergeant starks is in the room, [beat] and i want to know when i'm going home.}
<A>__{when he speaks, starks maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his surroundings.}

<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] yes.}
<A>__{with starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that this is starks' own trial. the voice belongs to a satisfied prosecution who turns to face a medium sized crowd watching on...}
<L>__{interior courtroom, small town vermont}
<A>__{there are three key witnesses called to the stand: captain medley, starks' commanding officer in the persian gulf; dr. hale, a psychiatrist; and officer nash, the cop who first came upon the crime scene. their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against starks quickly and confusingly just like it appears to himself.}
<D>__{officer nash [emotional] eddie [correcting himself], officer harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood on his back.}
<C>__{dr. hale}
<D>__{william starks could be blocking the incident. it would explain his well systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. a delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this. officer nash [cont'd] officer harrison'd been shot three times. he was long dead by the time we got there.}

<D>__{sergeant starks was awarded the purple heart. that award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [beat] it applauds honor. dr. hale [cont'd] his subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then.}
<A>__{the following summations are punctuated by the black fades between them and the simulated black around them as they speak like starks, at the beginning of his own testimony.}
<D>__{prosecution [disdainfully] it's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! he absolutely was. three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. captain medley [incensed] war isn't a cnn special. half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. it was ugly. and they don't put ugly on tv. [looking at starks] if starks did kill that officer ... [beat] you can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind.}

<D>__{that's too bad. i don't believe in disposable language either you know, the small talk, the little talk. chit. chat. useless. the game's something else though. think about it: what can we trade with each other in the air between us? this... [running his hand through the air] is our court. [beat, so eager it's sad] i'm ready to throw the ball. come on.}
<A>__{starks looks at mackenzie and sees that the constant flow of words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his eyes. a dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight.}
<D>__{starks [relenting] what are you in here for?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i tried to kill my wife.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{don't you go to jail for that?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i tried something like 30 times.}
<A>__{there is, as starks rightly figures, no suitable response to that.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{she's bigger than me, and she's stronger than me. and i never planned on doing it. it was always in the heat of the moment. i didn't beat her or anything. hell, she beat me. but when we'd start fighting, i'd go for the knife. then she kept threatening to have me put away, and [looking around] she finally did.}
<A>__{as he talks, mackenzie notes the scars on starks' arms. dr. lorenson observes starks and mackenzie talking and starts walking towards them.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{or just plain stupid. you'd think by the twentieth time, i'd have found an alternative method. maybe a more effective one, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{morning, gentlemen. how are you doing today?}
<A>__{mackenzie winks discreetly at starks before he replies.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{it's a hard one for me, dr. lorenson. [finally turns to face her, grimly] the world around me, it's shrinking. there's not even room for light to make its way in. [beat] da da bum! da da bum! i feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me, doc. only today, he's not carrying flowers.}

<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{and you, mr. starks? starks [already on the defense] i'm fine.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{mr. mackenzie, do you think i could talk to mr. starks privately?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{of course you can, doc. william, it was an absolute pleasure. thanks for playing.}
<A>__{just before he walks away, mackenzie turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks starks right in the eye.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{hey...when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. [beat] they don't eat you when there's music playing.}
<A>__{starks looks at mackenzie briskly, wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut. but mackenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away dead arm in tow.}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{so you're ok? starks [still distracted] what?}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{i asked you if you're ok. starks [suspiciously] i don't know. you tell me, doc. you think there's anything wrong with me?}
<C>__{dr. lorenson}
<D>__{i don't know. you're not my patient.}

<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i am. one of the few things i remember doing is eating. so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams.}

<A>__{as soon as they let him go, starks lunges for becker pushing him up against the wall. starks stops, presumably about to harm becker but unsure, even to himself, of what he's capable of doing... becker looks fearlessly into starks' eyes.}

<C>__{becker}
<D>__{the only thing your mind is missing is a conscience.}

[beat] the medication i'm given him is intended to adjust maybe even reset his violent proclivities. you know, peel away some of those layers of hate. the jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen. the grounds and the halls where i can't monitor side effects i can't predict aren't. dr. gries [still doubtful] but, but...what about... becker [mocking gries] but...but what about the gun? i mean, should he have been firing away like that?

<A>__{starks is almost there. as random orderlies pass him, starks lets his posture collapse as he despondently hangs his head down so low they can't see his face. they pass, and starks starts scuttling towards the door to the outside. as soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold with only his blue patient uniform starks walks normally, like he no longer remembers the risks. instead he remembers what jackie told him.}

<A>__{starks leans down seemingly oblivious to the cold and lifts some snow to his mouth, tasting it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive. he's so rapt that lorenson's voice takes him by surprise.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{hey. you're not supposed to be out here.}
<A>__{starks stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where his body was found. the terrible question asks itself on his face: is this when starks is killed?}
<D>__{starks [turning around sharply] what are you going to do to me?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{as lorenson reaches into his pocket for something, starks anxiously holds his breath. it's black when it comes out and... a ski hat when it opens up. starks lets out his breath, relieved.}

<C>__{starks}
<D>__{and if i didn't want to come?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i guess i'd ask you why.}

<D>__{because i don't think i'm crazy.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you're not crazy.}
<A>__{starks is surprised by lorenson's agreement.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you suffer from delusional disorder. that doesn't mean you're... crazy. it just means you're confused. and you're here, instead of in jail, because that was determined to have played a role in your killing of a police officer. starks [correcting him] alleged killing of a police officer.}

<D>__{you were convicted of the crime.}

<L>__{interior ward 3, alpine grove, 1992, day}
<A>__{starks is in a different ward with patients who appear more threatening and disturbed. as he is anxiously looking around presumably for a way out starks hears one of the patients humming an eerily discordant melody. looking to see who it comes from, starks happens to spot one patient a young, fierce looking guy eyeing a young nurse, sally, administering medication from a dated cart. starks looks around the room and notes there are no doctors or orderlies around. the young nurse, meanwhile, is focused on the medicine oblivious to the brute eyeing her. the brute's not that far away when he starts walking towards the young nurse. starks starts in their direction, picking up speed maneuvering through various incoherent patients as the brute reaches the nurse. he throws her tray down and pushes her against the wall. she starts screaming as he pushes up against her. starks picks up the tray and strikes the brute across the head with it. the brute holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance. it's clear he's impaired. but it's also clear he understands pain.}
<D>__{starks [to sally] you ok?}
<A>__{as she nods, her eyes dart above to the hand about to strike him. off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the brute in the stomach hard but not before the piece of glass he held from one of the broken medicine bottles comes perilously close to starks' head. the brute bowls over and starks looks at the glass terrified. is this when he dies? the brute incensed more than ever lunges at him a final time. starks gets him by the neck, expertly applying pressure points and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. starks himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. he lets out a suspended breath, instinctively touching his forehead to make sure he's not cut. he looks back at sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, why are you in this ward alone? where is everyone? sally [defensively] there's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. but i've been alone before...}

<D>__{fine, mr. starks. you can pull up a chair for yourself.}
<A>__{as starks walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone as they turn their heads to watch him that he is a physically ailing man. using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the group, dragging a chair behind him because he doesn't have the strength to lift it. starks sits down.}

<A>__{dr. morgan goes inside and jackie takes starks' hand as they wait. it's hardly more than a couple seconds when lorenson appears in the doorway. she looks at starks curiously and the two share a very lengthy, intense stare. dr. lorenson now in her 50s walks closer to starks suspiciously. for his part, starks doesn't look as unfamiliar with lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape lorenson.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{hello. i'm beth lorenson.}
<A>__{she puts out a hand that is trembling slightly.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's nice to meet you, mr. starks...}
<A>__{starks hesitates before he takes lorenson's hand. there is something very eerie about the exchange. starks quickly lets go and lorenson turns to jackie...}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{and you are...?}
<A>__{jackie looks back uncomfortably.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm just william's friend.}
<A>__{lorenson looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to dr. morgan.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i think we'll be fine from here. thanks, stanley.}
<L>__{interior lorenson's office, alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{lorenson leans against her desk while starks and jackie sit in the chairs. as they talk, each seems cautious in his exchange not knowing what the other one does or doesn't know.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{my god you look exactly like him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i never knew my father. did you?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{yeah, i did. [beat] he was my most memorable patient.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{lorenson considers her answer.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{at the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you thought my father was crazy?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{no. i don't think he was crazy. he needed help...but he wasn't crazy. [beat] your father actually helped me with a case of mine.}
<A>__{lorenson waits to see if starks knows what she is talking about.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what case?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i was working with a boy named eugene.}
<A>__{starks shows no recognition but jackie does.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who was eugene? lorenson [peaked] he was a friend's son. [beat] are you familiar with the case?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{just a little, when we were looking up information about william's father. how did he help?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's complicated, but [looking at starks] in a way, your father let me know how i'd get through to him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{he just said...that i'd shock eugene and then things would change for him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i still don't either, even after all these years.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{do you know how my father died? lorenson [unconvincingly] i don't know how much i remember but i seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{how'd he get it?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] i don't know.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{but dr. morgan said you were around when my father was...}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i was. but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. i'm sorry i don't know more about your father's. [sincerely] i didn't know about everything that went on here.}
<A>__{lorenson says it like she's hiding something.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{well, do you think dr. becker would have any idea?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{how do you know about dr. becker?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{my dad wrote some things down before he died.}
<A>__{lorenson looks like she's suddenly remembering something.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{that's right. he did.}
<A>__{starks looks at lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what lorenson is talking about.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{so maybe dr. becker would know. [beat] but, as i'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why would we do that?}
<A>__{starks just stares at lorenson, not knowing if he died by this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i see you've done your homework. [beat] alpine grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. at the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [beat] now, we do. and things are different.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i wouldn't be so sure. like you said about back then, you might not know everything going on around here.}
<A>__{dr. lorenson looks right at starks.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] yeah, it is. lorenson [eerily] it's almost as if your life depended on it. isn't it?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] we will.}
<L>__{interior hallway, alpine grove, day}
<A>__{starks and jackie walk briskly down it, away from lorenson's office.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't believe a thing she just said.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{me neither. who was the boy she was talking about, eugene?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you think lorenson kills you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{maybe. i don't know. seems more likely becker does, but at the very least she knows how i died.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{let's see if they have an address for becker. i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because that's the part i believe is true. you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled.}
<A>__{starks nods.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] there's one more thing i want to see.}
<L>__{interior corridor [leading to basement], alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{starks, determined, now leads jackie. as they reach the end of the hall, we see damon now in his 50s look after them curiously before he goes back to his work with a patient.}

<L>__{interior morgue, basement, alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{the morgue looks exactly as before. starks is momentarily jarred in the room. he looks to the wall on which the jacket hung and sees only the bare hooks that used to hold it up.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{this was the room. they used to hang the jacket there. [turning to jackie] this is where it happened. this is the room i'm actually in right now.}
<A>__{jackie isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be convinced...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i can show you. it's probably in there.}
<A>__{starks walks to the cadaver drawers and rests his hands on the one they put him in. then, with great difficulty physical and emotional he opens it to see if there is anything left. he pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{maybe this wasn't such a good idea...}
<A>__{starks leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the stained metal still reddened and browned with dried blood and the part of the morgue slab he clawed his nails into when he was in it. jackie looks at it in disbelief.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yes, it was. [softly] my fingers were the only things i could move. [beat] dead bodies don't bleed. and they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal.}
<L>__{interior hallway, basement, alpine grove}
<A>__{starks and jackie are leaving the morgue, when starks spots damon, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. damon stares at him curiously; starks glares back furiously.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{you folks ain't supposed to be down here.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we were just leaving.}
<A>__{damon doesn't take his eyes off starks.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{do i know you from somewhere?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you may have known my father, william starks.}
<A>__{damon smiles, remembering...}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{that's right! goddamn, you're the spitting image. i didn't know he had a son.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he didn't either. damon [with a dirty laugh] i will be damned. he musta been 12 when he had you. [beat] you could be his ghost.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{did you know my father?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{oh yeah, sure. he killed a cop, right?}
<A>__{starks looms strangely over damon in this exchange.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? damon [slightly apprehensive] no, i don't. i just remember them finding his body.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you don't know any more, damon? damon [shocked] how'd you know my name?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{my father used to talk about you.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{oh yeah, what'd he say?}
<A>__{damon's eyes betray his unease.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail.}
<A>__{damon is shocked, and cowed. so much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{look here, i don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i thought you said you never knew your father.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't. [beat] did you have anything to do with his death?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about, man. i swear. this is some weird shit you're telling me... and i don't know how come you're doing it.}
<A>__{starks starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. someone had to have given him it.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{i never touched your father! i swear!}
<A>__{damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven fear. starks leans in closer to damon as he remembers...}

<D>__{you know something, damon? you're like a mule. you're real stubborn. but there's ways of fixin' that. all you need is a good stick. [beat] here's your stick. live with it.}

[beat] still doesn't make me think i am. starks [adjusting it himself] and, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think i am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first.}

<D>__{lorenson [somewhat angrily] how do you know about eugene!? starks [shaking his head in disbelief] you told me. it's like two parts of you talking through me. look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way i could know about him.}
