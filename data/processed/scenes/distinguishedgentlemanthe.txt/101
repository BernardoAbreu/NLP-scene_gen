<L>__{exterior park school florida day}
<A>__{children playing on swings and seesaws in a small public park. tilt up. a pair of electric power derricks carrying 225,000 volt lines almost directly overhead. the derricks cast shadows across a nearby school. we see the neighborhood. quite a few for sale signs. a house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn. on tommy taking it all in. with him are celia and the jubas.}
<C>__{mrs. juba}
<D>__{five children in the neighborhood have cancer. one more has precancerous lesions. pregnant women around here are scared to death.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{this is mickey's school?}
<C>__{mrs. juba}
<D>__{turns out a lot of schools are near power lines. the land's cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but isn't the school district responsible?}
<C>__{mrs. juba}
<D>__{we asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school. he said, okay, only it'll cost forty thousand dollars, and what program did we want him to cut that from?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{nice.}
<C>__{mrs. juba}
<D>__{we're nobody, congressman. you're somebody. we need your help.}
<A>__{tommy takes celia aside.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{do you believe it?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{it's impossible to know. no one's really looked into it hard enough.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but why isn't it being investigated?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? what about those side effects of that sleeping pill, halcion? why isn't anything being investigated? it's always the same.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{money talks.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{you got it.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{there must be something i can do for those people.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{don't tell me you're actually developing a conscience.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{shit, i hope not it'd be a fucking nuisance in congress.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{no, that's not fair. some people on the hill actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don't forget why they went to washington, and who sent them.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{no shit.}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, i met one of those geeks. so what can i do?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{make a stink. round up some members and hold a press conference. get that committee of yours to hold hearings. haul in in the environmental protection agency, the surgeon general, the national academy of sciences. get the issue on every breakfast table in america.}
