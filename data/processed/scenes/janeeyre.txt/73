<A>__{jane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the rising sun. she is lit by its glowing rays; inspired. it's a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding as the day itself happiness.}
<L>__{interior day. thornfield rochester's room.}
<A>__{jane looks in to see leah and martha cleaning the soot from the woodwork and windowpanes. to her amazement, grace poole is there, calmly sewing rings to new curtains.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{good day to you, miss.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what's happened here?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(cannily)}
<D>__{only master reading in his bed last night.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{fell asleep with his candle lit and the curtains got on fire. managed to put it out with the water from his stand. did you not hear anything, miss?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i did. i heard a strange laugh.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's hardly likely the master would laugh when he was in such danger. perhaps you were dreaming.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i was not.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{then you didn't think of opening your door and looking out?}
<A>__{jane is infuriated. she turns on her heel.}
