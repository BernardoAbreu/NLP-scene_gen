<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can. she's in her own world, very upset. a car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow down, knowing the light is about to change. a boy in a passing car whistles at jody, waking her out of her stupor. jody looks up just as the light turns red. she hits her brakes and skids into the tail of the oncoming car. she glances off it and goes sliding off the road, into a few garbage cans. the car nicks another car and pulls over. across the street, we see that the killer's imperial is stopped at the red light. jody gets up, shaken. he knees and elbows are badly scratched. the owner of the car comes running over to jody.}
