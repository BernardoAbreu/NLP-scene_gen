<A>__{he looks over at the giant head. the eyes are still staring at him they seem to have shifted. rick shrugs it off and looks around. he walks over to elijah's car. it's locked too. he checks the big eyes. they've moved again. rick's getting a bit desperate. he sees something else and runs towards it. it's a dry docked motorboat. it's locked too. the eyes have followed rick again. he sees something else and runs over to it. it's a bag of golf clubs leaning against elijah's porch. they're locked too.}
