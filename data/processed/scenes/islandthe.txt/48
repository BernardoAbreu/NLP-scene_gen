<A>__{another angle: starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up the avenue. in bg, scheer steps forth, stopgun levelled , aiming boom the flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead. thud starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the back, arching as the hookhead bites ; but he keeps on running boom boom boom scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air. thud thud thud starkweather jolts from one, two, three more hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running.}

<A>__{a n o the r angle; floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. known as "lode pins" their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream. the hookheads c l a w e d in starkweather's back also start blinking red. the invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, starkweather feels its force. the duelling polarities stealing his traction. his run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . then his feet leave the ground. he flails for a handhold. but there's nothing. the force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out to dangle him in mid air, squirming about like a fish on a hook. a n o the r angle; scheer advances to reel in his catch. the stream bows before him, red lights blinking out. until all that remains is the section where starkweather hangs suspended. scheer stops at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit.}

<A>__{reverse angle: lincoln in cu, looking down. he has seen and heard all that has just passed. in his eyes, we see his daze clearing, consciousness coalescing, deepening. his pupils dilating into a deep and uncanny stare. what can only be described as a dawning.}
