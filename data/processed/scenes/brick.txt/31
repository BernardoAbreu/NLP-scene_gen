<L>__{exterior back patio}
<A>__{the two drinks, where brendan left them. laura takes hers and drains it. the suburban lights twinkle like stars.}
<L>__{exterior carrows parking lot day}
<A>__{the sun rises over carrows family restaurant, a squat structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel ravine. a banner from 1973 in the window "coffee and pie oh my!" a pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster. their beady eyes follow brendan in sync as he approaches. he goes to the nearest one.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{where's dode?}
<C>__{stoner 1}
<D>__{dunno, bra.}
<A>__{silence and blank stares. brendan calmly moves to the next stoner.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{dode?}
<C>__{stoner 2}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{brendan moves to the next one. a thin head pokes from around the dumpster.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{hey brendan. maybe you shouldn't be here.}
<A>__{brendan steps around the dumpster. dode slumps against the wall, thin and delicate in dusty black. slivery eyes, pale lips, muffled intelligence.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{kara told me you know where em's at.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{uh huh. and why are you looking for em?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{she asked for my help.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{uh huh. listen man, i've got plenty on my plate without dealing with some jilted ex.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it's not about that.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{whatever it's about, act smarter than you look and drop it.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{she's with me, and right now that's the best place for her. leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you're on the bright side of dim, dode, but if i thought you had this half handled i'd be eating lunch. where's she at?}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{better get while it's good.}
<A>__{brendan doesn't.}
<C>__{dode }
<D>__{heel it now, dig?}
<A>__{the 5 big stoners appear behind brendan, threatening. dode turns his head away to light a jointerior brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint spinning. brendan slams dode's frail frame against the dumpster. the 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the headlights. one makes a half hearted motion to intervene.}
<C>__{big stoner}
<D>__{back off.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{throw one at me if you want, hash head. i've got all five senses and i slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you.}
<C>__{big stoner}
<D>__{just easy }
<A>__{brendan slams dode into the wall.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(to dode)}
<D>__{where's em?}
<C>__{dode}
<P>__{(deliberate)}
<D>__{she's with me. she was tight when she called you, man. came to and freaked. she told me to shake you if you came by. said you'd only make things worse.}
<A>__{brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly well. he drops dode.}
<C>__{stoner 1 }
<D>__{put him down, man!}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{deal with whatever this ain't about and drop it.}
<C>__{big stoner}
<P>__{(to brendan)}
<D>__{nothing more here, bra.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tell emily i want to see her. tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but i want to hear it straight from her.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{she don't }
<A>__{brendan walks away.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{today. she knows where i eat lunch.}
<A>__{when brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction}
<C>__{big stoner}
<D>__{and stay out, punk!}
