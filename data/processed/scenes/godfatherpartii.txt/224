<C>__{senator kane }
<D>__{are you the son of vito corleone?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{senator king}
<D>__{did he use at times an alias? was this alias in certain circles godfather?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it was not an alias. godfather was a term of affection, used by his friends, one of respect.}
<C>__{senator weekler}
<P>__{(senator from new}
<D>__{york, very smooth, partly liberal,}
<P>__{tammany hall)}
<D>__{let me agree with that. many of my constituents are italian and have been honored with that certain friendship by my close italian friends. up to this point before i have to leave this hearing to join my own committee, let me say, that this hearing on the mafia is in no way a slur on the italians by the senate; nor is it meant to be; nor will i allow it to be. italian americans are the hardest working, most law abiding patriotic americans of our country. it is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name. we are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of italian americans, who are one of the backbones of our country.}
<A>__{there is a pause for a while, while the new york senator poses for the tv cameras and leaves the hearing so that he will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{i'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. now, mr. corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. we have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful mafia family in this country. are you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{this witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a new york police captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named virgil sollozzo. do you deny this?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i deny his every charge.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that is a complete falsehood.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that is not true. i own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. i also own some american telephone and ibm stock.}
<A>__{michael had checked this point with hagen, before answering, and then once again after the answer.}
<C>__{senator rogers}
<D>__{why is it necessary for your counsel to advise you on that question?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{senator, i've observed the head of general motors before a senate committee, and his lawyer whispered in his ear. that was not commented upon in the way you have just done.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{mr. corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona? or any gambling interests in that state?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i do not.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i do not.}
<A>__{a pause. silence, as the chairman whispers something to his assistant. tom hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses the chair.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{i don't think that's necessary.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity. he has not taken that fifth amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. so, i think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.}
<C>__{senator kane}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{at this point senator rogers contemptuously walks out of the hearing room.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{in the hopes of clearing my family name, in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the american way of life without a blemish on their name and background i have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power. i consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all americans of italian extraction. i consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that i am a criminal. i wish to have the following noted for the record. that i served my country faithfully and honorably in world war ii and was awarded the distinguished service cross for actions in defense of my country. that i have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever... that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy, whether it is called mafia or cosa nostra or whatever other name you wish to give, has ever been made public. only one man has made charges against me, and that man is known to be a murderer, arsonist and rapist. and yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name. my personal protest can only be made to the people of this country. i can only thank god that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation. i thank god for our democratic due process of law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness. i have not taken refuge behind the fifth amendment, though counsel advised me to do so. i challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me, and if they do not, i hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it. i ask this without malice, in the interests of fair play.}
<A>__{the television cameras have documented this moment, as hagen hands the document over to the committee lawyer.}
<C>__{senator rogers}
<D>__{we are all impressed. the committee will now recess over the weekend. however, it will continue monday morning, at eleven a.m. at that time, this committee will then produce a witness directly linking mr. corleone to the charges we have made. and then, mr. corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury. however, this document will be made a matter of record.}
