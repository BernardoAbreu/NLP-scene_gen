<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door. satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs... we stay at the foot of the stairs moving into darkness, shadow and form begin to take shape. we hear a low growl and see a flash of red eyes. it's zowie. already in the house.}
<L>__{123 interior chase's bedroom night}
<A>__{coming through the door from the downstairs, chase stops cold. renee is on the bed. clothed in a negligee. lying across a blanket of rose petals. her eyes meet his with powerful longing.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{chase. i miss you so much...}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(dry mouthed)}
<D>__{renee...}
<A>__{chase approaches. slowly. fearful that this is all a dream. renee reaches out her hand. they touch. this is not a dream.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as renee draws his body to hers. they kiss. once. twice. not a dream. renee rolls chase over, forcefully climbing on top. chase sinks down into the center of the bed as renee straddles him. slowly, renee slips off the top of her negligee...}
<C>__{renee}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i can come back, chase...}
<A>__{...and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily. her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she grinds her hips against his. almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable. chase fights to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe...}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{no... too heavy.}
<A>__{there is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as renee's body comes down on him harder.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{...can't breathe... i can't...}
<A>__{chase's eyes pop open, frenzied, as he comes out of his dream. chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight pressing down on him...}
<B>__{zowie}
<A>__{is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in a growl... zowie lunges forward, jaws flashing, and chase twists sideways... gnashing teeth connect with chase's shoulder, then with the pillows where chase's head used to be. a blizzard of down feathers}
<B>__{erupts...}
<A>__{chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside table... the gun spins out of reach and across the floor... chase dives for the gun and reaches it just as zowie leaps to the floor. in a panic, chase fires wild... zowie abruptly turns and smashes through the bedroom window, sending glass flying.}
