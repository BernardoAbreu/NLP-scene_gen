<A>__{willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain, amazed and frightened. animals rustle in the brush and he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking burrs off his legs. he hides from a fierce bear. the bear sees him and runs away. willow hurries along, shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's weight.}
<L>__{exterior road evening}
<A>__{the baby is fussing hungrily. willow impetuously digs a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to feed her. then he hears something. sensing danger, he clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank. he hides under a bridge. nockmaar soldiers on horseback thunder toward the bridge, led by the knight sorsha whose face is hidden under a black helmet and visor. in the other direction willow sees a lieutenant and two death dogs. they all meet on the bridge. the hideous soldiers are part hu man, part beast.}

<D>__{we've patrolled the hills. this is where they killed the nursemaid.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{she must have done something with the child. widen the search!}
<A>__{one of the death dogs is chewing on the lieutenant's stirrup.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{get away from there!}
<A>__{the dog panics and gnashes at the lieutenant's arm, ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth. horses rear. the lieutenant draws his sword lightning fast. he slices and kills the death dog. the baby begins to cry but the death howl of the beast drowns her out as it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below. the soldiers gallop off into the woods. willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away from the murdered death dog which lies bloody and twisted in the water. the terrified baby cries in his arms.}
