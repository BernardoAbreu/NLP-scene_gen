<L>__{exterior country road wild wagon ride night}
<A>__{west's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be trampled under the hooves of the freaked out horses. and if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out. close back of wagon nitro vials clanking together like chimes... close west straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he pulls himself up by the harness onto... close wild eyed lead horse west grabs for the halter.}

<D>__{whoa now...!}
<A>__{but it doesn't whoa. the wagon goes around a corner up on two wheels! it's about to tilt over when west grabs both the horses' ears, yanks them back screaming into them.}
<C>__{west}
