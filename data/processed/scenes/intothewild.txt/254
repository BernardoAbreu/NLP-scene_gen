<A>__{the place is packed with a line out the door. lori, the second assistant manager, hurries back into the kitchen, where we find chris in paper cap, bunning whoppers at a leisurely pace.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{chris, you gotta go faster. we've got a line out the door.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(a bit oblivious)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{but then just continues on at his leisurely daydreaming pace. lori is about to say something but by now she knows there's no getting through to him. she looks down to the floor where we see that chris wears no socks.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(extending patience)}
<D>__{chris, i don't mean to be on you about everything. you're doing a great job.}
<C>__{lori }
<D>__{i want to keep you on. and we all want to help you get to alaska, but you've got to start wearing socks.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{right, right. i forgot.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{and please. hurry. we're ten deep.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{but the pace remains.}
