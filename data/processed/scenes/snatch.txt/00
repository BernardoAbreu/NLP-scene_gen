<A>__{we open on a guard sitting in front of a sentry post. he is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military jacket. behind him is a list of instructions (in russian). he 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin for oxygen. a car comes to a stop by the sentry post, the, guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick his head in the car. a gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier. this next section will be intercut with the credit sequence.}
