<A>__{the judge and the beadle walk away from the impressive edifices of the old bailey.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{thank you, your honor. just the sentence we wanted.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{was he guilty?}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{well, if he didn't do it, he's surely done something to warrant a hanging.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what man has not?}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{no matter come, walk home with me. i have news for you, my friend. in order to shield her from the evils of this world, i have decided to marry my dear johanna.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{ah, sir, happy news indeed.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{strange, though, when i offered myself to her she showed a certain ... reluctance.}
<A>__{the beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy:}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{excuse me, my lord, may i request, my lord, permission, my lord, to speak? forgive me if i suggest, my lord, you're looking less than your best, my lord, there's powder upon your vest, my lord. and stubble upon your cheek, and ladies, my lord, are weak.}
<A>__{as they round a corner, the judge feels his chin:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{stubble, you say? perhaps at times i am a little overhasty with my morning ablutions...}
<C>__{beadle}
<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{fret not though, my lord, i know a place, my lord, a barber, my lord, of skill. thus armed with a shaven face, my lord, some eau de cologne to brace my lord and musk to enhance the chase, my lord, you'll dazzle the girl until she bows to your every will.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{a barber, eh? take me to him.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{i am honored, my lord. his name is todd ... sweeney todd. and he is the very last word in barberin'.}
<A>__{they head off.}
