<P>__{(to alison)}
<A>__{that guy said, "don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out."}

<A>__{yeah, i heard him.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to alison)}
<A>__{that was hilarious.}
<C>__{debbie}
<A>__{that would be a good idea.}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{you've been mad because i've been working so much and i didn't want to upset you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<A>__{i wouldn't be mad.}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{you would be.}
<C>__{debbie}
<A>__{i don't get mad.}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{it's a fantasy baseball draft. i'm not cheating or anything.}
<C>__{debbie}
<A>__{no, this is worse.}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{how is this worse?}
<C>__{debbie}
<A>__{this is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family.}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{look, the reason i make that up is because if i told you what i was really doing, you would just get mad. so, you think i'm seeing a band, i do my fantasy draft, and it's win win.}
<D>__{knocked up 89.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well, what did you do last wednesday night when you said you went to see a band?}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{why do you want to go by yourself? why didn't you ask me to go?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{because i needed to get away, you know? with work and you and the kids, sometimes i just need some time to myself.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i need time for myself. i want time for myself, too.}
<A>__{debbie holds back tears.}
<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{you're not the only one.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's not that big of a deal.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{i like spiderman.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{okay, so let's see "spiderman three" next week.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't want to go see it now.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't want to have to ask you to ask me. i want you to just come up with it on your own.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what? i don't even know what to say. uh, what do you want me to do? knocked up 90.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm not being mean. i'm being honest. you're telling me i need to be honest. just }
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're lying.}
<C>__{pete}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how come we go to the gynecologist so often? i bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three hundred thousand dollar machine he has.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i cannot stop thinking about what an asshole pete is.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's a little strong, i would say.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{really? because that had to be one of the most selfish things i've ever witnessed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's understandable. i even think it's kind of funny.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{what's funny about it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, you won't laugh now, i wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation. knocked up 91.}
<C>__{ben }
<A>__{we break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.if you saw that on television, you would laugh.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{is that what you think?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{is that what you want to do, ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i don't even like baseball. i'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and i get that. i totally understand where he's coming from.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{why do you guys always go to that place? you miss male camaraderie. what do i give a shit? go hang out with your bearded freak friends. i don't care. you want to hang out with guys that look like the shoe bomber, it's all on you, man.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{well what the fuck am i supposed to say to that?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{you should just support me! you know, you should just support everything i say because at this juncture in my life, i'm allowed to be wrong!}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{so if you're wrong, i have to support it?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{yes!}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{oh, that's helpful. you have to do nothing!}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{you are just fucking sitting there! you haven't sacrificed anything!}
<D>__{knocked up 92.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you've sacrificed your vagina?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{yes! it will never look the same after this!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well. fine. i will pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{you can't pay for shit! you can barely buy spaghetti.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're right. fine!}
