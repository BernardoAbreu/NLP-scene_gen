<A>__{once again, wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends.}

<D>__{rest, william.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i rest.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{your rest is making me exhausted.}
<A>__{stephen offers the jug; wallace declines.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{come, it'll help you sleep.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{aye. but it won't let me dream.}
<A>__{pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down. longshanks, interior his palace night he sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. but he ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting. the princess, exterior the walls of her castle night she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts. robert the bruce, in a stone room of his castle sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. the coffin is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his father as a knight in final repose. ranks of candles light the scene, and robert's face, cold as the stone. a shuffle... robert looks up to see old craig.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{may he rest in peace... you have already sealed the coffin?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{he was a modest man.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.}
<A>__{craig sits next to robert, and keeps his voice low.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{our nobles are frightened and confused... wallace has the commoners stirred up again, from the highland clans to the lowland villages. in another six months christ and the apostles could not govern this country.}
<A>__{robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{longshanks knows his son will scarcely be able to rule england, much less half of france. he needs scotland settled, and he trusts you, after falkirk. if you pay him homage, he will recognize you as king of scotland. our nobles have agreed to this as well.}
<A>__{he shows robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in scotland. the bruce barely glances at it.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{if i pay homage to another's throne, then how am i a king?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{homage is nothing. it is the crown that matters!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{the crown is that of scotland. and scotland is william wallace.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{that is another matter. there is a price to all this, required both by longshanks and our nobles. pay it, and you will be our king. and we will have peace.}
<A>__{robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at craig.}
