<L>__{exterior jackie's house dusk}
<A>__{rachel and luke heading up the path to jackie's door. it is early winter. stark trees, a light snow on the ground. rachel pulls her coat tighter around her.}

<A>__{ben rumbling down the hall to the door. stands in front of it, as the bell rings again.}
<C>__{ben}

<A>__{so he does. gives her a sweet hug.}
<C>__{luke }

<A>__{they follow rachel down the hall...}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(mister rogers)}
<D>__{we'll share. like good neighbors.}
<A>__{they enter the living room. annabelle sits sullenly in front of the tv. her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey, gorgeous, where's big mama?}
<A>__{no answer. annabelle worried about something.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she still packing for her trip?}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{i killed my math quiz, a minus.}
<A>__{they slap five. go through the ritual of a three step black guy handshake.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and...other things? at school?}
<A>__{annabelle cuts a look in luke and ben's direction. please not in front of the menfolk.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we'll talk. i will go check on mom.}
<A>__{annabelle frowns at mom's name. rachel strokes her. heads down the hall... knocks at the open door to jackie's bedroom, where jackie is calmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open suitcase. she waves rachel in, and keeps working.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(checking out the stuff)}
<D>__{it's gonna be cool, huh?}
<A>__{bulky sweaters. wool things.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i can never figure weather. last trip, i made all the wrong choices.}
<A>__{rachel and we have a better angle now. jackie looks awful. drawn, weak, masking pain with obvious courage.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{bad day?}
<A>__{rachel sits on the edge of the bed. jackie turns away, goes to her open chest of drawers.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{can't complain.}
<A>__{even her voice is carefully under control. awkward, rachel looks around the room. a stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open. works in progress.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{can i look at the pictures?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's a mess, right now. that's my project when i get back.}
<A>__{so quiet, we can hear a clock ticking nearby. rachel's gaze returns to the bulky sweaters. holds there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{see, i'm not going to houston, after all.}
<A>__{like you obviously figured out.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{there's this clinic in montreal. we've studied their process, we like their success rate...}
<A>__{two women nodding, in a calm, matter of fact way. as if discussing recipes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{they combine some compounds that have been getting results in france, with vitamin injections. seems to activate the chemo...}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so. hopeful.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's promising, this one. we're upbeat.}
<A>__{rachel swallows. she's out of words.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i really look like shit.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you look sick. but you look... together. mentally tough.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeh, that's bull. i'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.}
<A>__{a shrug. the first bitterness to seep through.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{prob'ly low percentage on mothers.}
<A>__{she sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor. pantomimes a smoke. rachel goes into her bag.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you try to center on the big issues, y'know. what it's all about. what this whole trip has meant. but then, the really big issues keep swamping y...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{brad kovitsky.}
<A>__{tosses jackie a pack. matches nexterior}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you don't have any pot, i s'pose?}
<A>__{rachel's eyebrows head north.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the primo stuff is great for pain.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'}
<A>__{jackie lighting up. deep soulful drag.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so. she ignores this little kovitsky punk, takes the high moral ground...}
<A>__{reading rachel's face. who is already wincing.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(yeh)}
<D>__{he's relentless. a major asshole.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{and you said...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what else? keep on keepin' on.}
<A>__{oh. rachel tries to hide her disappointment.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she has to stick with it. have the patience, the guts, to ignore the pain. you disagree?}
<A>__{half a beat. rachel shakes her head, nope.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{hey. you oughta know.}
