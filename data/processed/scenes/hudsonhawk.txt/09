<L>__{exterior outside the prison day}
<A>__{hawk strides to the massive sliding concrete door wall between him and freedom. as music crescendos and hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two mafioso brothers, cesar and antony mario, the latter sitting upon the hood of a tinted window lincoln continental. cesar is of cool, hair slicked back attitude, his scumbag brother is not.}
<C>__{antony}
<D>__{welcome back, buddy ol' pal. we've got a proposition...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{answer's no, not even if you bathe. cesar mario, antony mario, how's the "family?" kill any monkeys lately?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{how many times do i have to say it? i didn't put the hit on little eddie... never had anything against that kooky chimp. i actually found him, "endearing."}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{sure. face down. two endearing shots to the back of the head. that's your mark, man. what did little eddie ever do to...}
<A>__{smouldering, hawk struts off. cesar takes a black canvas bag from a scarfaced driver and hustles up to hawk. the lincoln rumbles behind them, antony riding on the hood.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{you're hitting rutherford's auction house. easy as my brother's wife. directions are in the bag. just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{or you cut off my thingie. directions even your brother would understand.}
<C>__{antony}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{yeah, directions even i could understand.}
<A>__{the car squeals to a stop. antony bounds off. cesar shove throws the canvas bag into hawk's unwilling hands.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{hawk, you're a great thief. got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of. don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware store and sell spatulas...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{if the mario brothers weren't jersey's third largest family, i'd say kiss my ass. but considering your status, i will say slurp my butt.}
<A>__{hawk fiercely push shoves the canvas bag back into cesar's hands.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{what's your favorite sport, hawk?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{baseball, why?}
<A>__{antony opens the back door of the lincoln and says "baseball." he is handed a baseball bat. hawk backs up as antony moves threateningly toward him.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i meant, ping pong. listen, i'd rather go back in than whore for you...}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{oh, i need to borrow ten dollars.}
<A>__{a prison guard from above turns as not to be a witness. hawk feebly calls up to him.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{help? police?}
<A>__{antony swings at hawk, who pretends not to notice until the last second. hawk ducks and slam kicks his calf. antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch. hawk boots up the bat for a two handed catch then savagely pivots it across antony's face, knocking him into the backseat of the car.}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{you need some time to think. that's cool, but next time, i'm not going to say "please."}
<A>__{cesar floats into the backseat. the lincoln takes off. hawk seethes...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i don't believe this. i've been out forty seconds...}
<A>__{a backfire rings out. hawk hits the ground, thinking it is a gunshot. hawk's on the ground p.o.v. a gasping 1960 caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too fancy to be tasteful shoes comes out. hawk looks up to see alex messina, his older, maybe maybe not wiser best friend.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's the first thing i did. smooch the ground and taste the freedom. sorry i was late. miss anything?}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... good to see you, alex, been having a lousy day.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{lousy day? the man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day. what, you missing out on the cell block water ballet pageant? believe me, it's overrated.}
<A>__{hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{where's the kiss? no tongue this time, i promise.}
<A>__{a laughing hawk gives alex's stomach a slap before getting in the car....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{looks like you've been expanding your...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't say it, hawkins. i'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{my next word was gonna be "consciousness." swear to god... tubby.}
