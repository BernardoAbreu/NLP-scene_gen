<L>__{exterior buddy's apartment building day}
<A>__{a dozen geriatric residents sit on chairs out front as buddy climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm, newspaper under the other. an old woman comes out the door as buddy opens it and squints at him.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{oh are you delivering the oxygen?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{uh, no, ma'am. sorry.}
<L>__{interior buddy's apartment day}
<A>__{buddy's real apartment, not the one karen pictured in her dream. this one's nicer, with a view of the beach. jack stands on the balcony going through karen's purse. he pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo. he does the same with her gym i.d. card. he finds her address book and opens it up. a photo of her father slips out. jack examines it a moment, then flips through the book. he stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in and comes up with her us marshal i.d. he slips it open and studies the badge and the picture opposite. he holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees... the open trunk of the car last night as karen gets out, saying...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you win, jack.}
<B>__{back in the apartment}
<A>__{foley turns away from the view as buddy walks in, sets the grocery bag down on the coffee table.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you made the front page.}
<A>__{he holds up the newspaper so that foley can see his picture on the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all that much like him.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i wasn't feeling my best that day. i'd just drawn thirty to life.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{maybe this'll make you feel better.}
<A>__{buddy reaches into the bag, tosses foley a new zippo.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it. he looks at the paper on the coffee table as buddy sits down, pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{paper says there's ten grand each on you, chino and lulu.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{say anything in there about karen sisco?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{just that she got away.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, but what happened after she drove off with glenn?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you'll have to ask glenn. and most likely, he's on his way to detroit, where we should be.}
<A>__{foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of karen's bag spread out on the table.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{you realize what you're doing? worrying about a person that works in law enforcement. you want to sit down and have cocktails with a girl that tried to shoot you. you hear what i'm saying?}
<A>__{foley holds up the picture of marshall sisco.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{think this old guy is her boyfriend? it's the only picture she carries.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{am i going to detroit by myself?}
<A>__{foley picks up her drivers licence photo.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{longer we hang around down here, jack, better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{we'll leave first thing in the morning.}
