<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{eve, trapped, in a corner of the room.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{she was a liar, she was a liar!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{answer my question! weren't you paid to get out of town?}
<A>__{eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears. addison, merciless, moves closer.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{fourth. there was no eddie no pilot and you've never been married! that was not only a lie, but an insult to dead heroes and to the women who loved them...}
<P>__{(eve, sobbing, puts her}
<D>__{hands over her ears; addison, closer, pulls}
<P>__{them away)}
<D>__{... fifth. san francisco has no shubert theater and north shore, you've never been to san francisco! that was a stupid lie, easy to expose, not worthy of you...}
<A>__{eve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i had to get in, to meet margo! i had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{she did like you, she helped and trusted you! you paid her back by trying to take bill away!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's not true!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i was there, i saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!}
<A>__{eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you used my name and my column to blackmail karen into getting you the part of "cora" and you lied to me about it!}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(into the bed)}
<D>__{no no no...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i had lunch with karen not three hours ago. as always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...}
<P>__{(he lets go of her hands)}
<D>__{... do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night?}
<A>__{eve covers her face with her hands.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{please... please...}
<A>__{addison get off the bed, looks down at her.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{that i should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability. but that, in itself, is probably the reason. you're an improbable person, eve, and so am i. we have that in common. also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love or be loved, insatiable ambition and talent. we deserve each other. are you listening to me?}
<A>__{eve lies listlessly now, her tear stained cheek against the coverlet. she nods.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{then say so.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes, addison.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{and you realize you agree how completely you belong to me?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes, addison.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{take your nap, now. and good luck for tonight.}
<A>__{he starts out.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{i won't play tonight.}
<P>__{(addison pauses)}
<D>__{i couldn't. not possibly. i couldn't go on...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{couldn't go on? you'll give the performance of your life.}
<A>__{he goes out. the camera remains on eve's forlorn, tear stained face. her eyes close... she goes to sleep.}
