<L>__{exterior two lane highway night}
<A>__{we see a clean moving pov illuminated by headlights. we are floating down an old two lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape. this gliding, eerie pov continues until the headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the road. this figure is a man, pete dayton. pete turns, unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to him. the ghost image of a house appears behind pete. there is a girl, sheila, standing on the lawn in front of the house. she is afraid and is trying to communicate with pete. pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly at us. now pete seems to move toward us as we move toward him. his head fills the screen.}
