<P>__{(sips his drink)}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{it's true. archie was the bitch and jughead was the butch that's why jughead wears that crown looking hat all the time: he the king, of queen archie's world.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{man, i feel a hate crime coming on}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior archie never did settle on betty or veronica.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{because he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes! he never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three way!}
<C>__{hooper}

<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{moi?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you are marching back across the street with me, and we're going to pick up a shit load of archie books, i am going to prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt that archie was all about pussy. come on.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(sliding out of booth)}
<D>__{this boy is conflicted, i shall play mother therapist for him. you two sit tight. we shall return promptly.}
<A>__{banky and hooper exit, leaving alyssa and holden alone at the table.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{is he always like that!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{for years now. started back in third grade a nun was teaching us about the blessed trinity. she's going on about the three persons in one god thing father, son, holy spirit and he just goes ballistic. i guess it was too big for him to grasp. they got into this huge fight.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{please. how bad could it have been!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you ever seen a nun call a small child a fucking cunt rag'? wasn't pretty, shit like that's bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and your parochial school misadventures!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{limited to wine tasting prior to mass. turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy. i couldn't tell you how many mornings after serous benders i'd wake up next to strange priests.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{aren't you the sharp wit!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sharp! no. i'm just a fan of clergy molestation humor. probably why the extended family quit inviting me to first communion parties.}
<A>__{alyssa laughs. holden smiles.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(looking oc)}
<D>__{you play darts!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{not professionally. you know only in bars.}
<B>__{at the dart board}
<A>__{a dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the board. alyssa winds up with another dart. holden watches. her's always hit. his never do.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so your new book seems to be selling like mad.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it goes back to something my grandmother told me when i was a kid. "holden," she said "the big bucks are in dick and fart jokes." she was a church goer.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{uh oh the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell pitying his good fortune. i'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm sorry did i detect a note of bitter envy in there!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{nope. i'm happy my stuff gets read at all. there's very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns field. if i sell two issues, i feel like john grisham.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{it's all about marketing. over or underweight guys who don't get laid they're our bread and butter. people like those two outside should be yours.}
<A>__{through the window, we see a couple making out on the hood of a car.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{and sadly, there are more of our core audience out there than yours.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{look at that, though kind of gives you a little charge, to see two people in love. and all over banky's car, no less. that car's seeing more action right now than it's seen in years.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{bubbly guy like that, it's hard to figure out why.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(still looking at oc couple)}
<D>__{you've gotta respect that kind of display of affection. it's crazy, rude, self absorbed but it's love.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that's not love.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{says you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that out there! that's fleeting.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{fleeting.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{uh huh. you wanna hear about love! oh, i will tell you about love.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a story?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{the story. the original love story.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{'doctor zhivago'.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{nope. my mother's uncle. he was a millionaire.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i kid you not.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{explain.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{all through high school, he dated this one girl. they were inseparable. and when they graduated, she went off to carnegie mellon...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{in pittsburgh.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm impressed. so he stays in the home town, and they begin their long distance relationship. the plan is, on the third sunday of every month, he'll train out, spend a week then train back they do this for four years.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{that is love.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not nearly finished. two months before she's going to graduate, he's got this job digging graves, and he comes across...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a stiff.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{a steamer trunk containing silver ingots.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{many, many silver ingots. now, my mother's uncle being quite the ingenious chap he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office, where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot. guess which one?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{clever.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so now he owns the plot and all of its contents. two days later, my mother's uncle is worth three million.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{at which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not even close. inside the steamer trunk, stenciled into the wood, or something like that, is a curse.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{someone wrote 'fuck' inside his new steamer trunk.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not that kind of curse. a cryptic curse "great fortune means great loss" it said.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{the same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots. the day my mother's uncle is heading out to see the girl, he stops at his accountant's to grab some cash, and winds up missing his train. so he has to take the next one which he does and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival, whereupon he sees lights.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a hero's welcome for the new millionaire.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it seems that while she was standing on the platform waiting that extra hour for my mother's uncle to show up, the girl was dragged into the bushes by an unknown assailant, raped and gutted.}
<A>__{holden is silent alyssa downs her drink.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{the assailant was never apprehended.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's a love story!!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle rode that train every day for the rest of his life. one day up, the next day back. did that 'till the day he died. he donated the fortune he'd acquired to the train station in pittsburgh, to have a well lit terminal built. the train line let him ride for free after that.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i should hope so. jesus, that's the saddest tale i've ever heard.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that's my love story.}
<A>__{alyssa tosses her last dart. holden seems a bit dazed. he looks out the window.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{those two aren't on the hood of banky's car anymore.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i told you it wasn't love.}
<P>__{(grabs her purse)}
<D>__{i gotta split. it was really nice meeting you. i wish you the best of luck with your book.}
<P>__{(shakes his hand)}
<D>__{tell hooper i will call him later. and tell your friend to calm down.}
<A>__{alyssa exits to the night. holden stares after her. two beats later, hooper and banky enter, holding an 'everything's archie' comic between them.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you're insane. archie is not fucking mister weatherbee!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{deny, deny, deny.}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{where's alyssa?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{huh! oh. she left. she said she'd call you later.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{he's just offering to help archie with his homework!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{read between the lines.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(shoves book at him)}
<D>__{fuck this.}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{let's go. traffic.}
<P>__{(no response from holden)}
<D>__{holden!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{d'jou see that dent in the hood of your car!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{what the...! son of a bitch!}
<A>__{banky runs out holden shrugs at hooper.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{let me guess: you like her!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{miss alyssa jones.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{she's alright.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{as long as that's all.}
<P>__{(finishes drink)}
<D>__{maybe you can convince that partner of your's to drop me off downtown before you scurry out the tunnel!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mister weatherbee wasn't really trying to fuck archie, was he!}
<A>__{they begin exiting.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hell no. weatherbee was reggie's bitch.}
