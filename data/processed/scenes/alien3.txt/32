<A>__{john stops. looks at the wall. ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{listen, priest, or whatever you are, i know what you want. i can't help you. i couldn't help any of the others. just stop what you're doing. go away. do you understand?}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you going to stay, father? but you're not going to talk. okay. then you can listen. you should listen. your abbot was right. i am guilty. but not of heresy. of murder.}

<A>__{john breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote filled air around him. ripley looks up at him.}

<D>__{i can't help you.}
<A>__{john, heaving and panting from the excertion. swallows...}
<C>__{john}
