<L>__{exterior poop deck night}
<A>__{a few minutes later. jack is being detained by the burly master at arms, the closest thing to a cop on board. he is handcuffing jack. cal is right in front of jack, and furious. he has obviously just rushed out here with lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress. the other man is colonel archibald gracie, a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. he offers it to rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. cal is more concerned with jack. he grabs him by the lapels.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! look at me, you filth! what did you think you were doing?!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{cal, stop! it was an accident.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{an accident?!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{it was... stupid really. i was leaning over and i slipped. rose looks at jack, getting eye contact.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. and i slipped and i would have gone overboard... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{you wanted to see the propellers?}
<C>__{gracie}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<A>__{women and machinery do not mix.}
<C>__{master at arms}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<A>__{was that the way of it? rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{uh huh. that was pretty much it. he looks at rose a moment longer. now they have a secret together.}
<C>__{colonel gracie}
<A>__{well! the boy's a hero then. good for you son, well done!}
<P>__{(to cal)}
<A>__{so it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh? jack is uncuffed. cal gets rose to her feet and moving.}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(rubbing her arms)}
<A>__{let's get you in. you're freezing. cal is leaving without a second thought for jack.}
<C>__{gracie}
<P>__{(low)}
<A>__{ah... perhaps a little something for the boy?}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{oh, right. mr. lovejoy. a twenty should do it.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{rose is displeased. mmm... what to do? cal turns back to jack. he appraises him condescendingly... a steerage ruffian, unwashed and ill mannered.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{i know.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<A>__{perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking straight at rose)}
<A>__{sure. count me in.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{good. settled then. cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around rose. he leans close to gracie as they walk away.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{this should be amusing.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(as lovejoy passes)}
<A>__{can i bum a cigarette? lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it open. jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for later. lovejoy lights jack's cigarette.}
<C>__{lovejoy}
<A>__{you'll want to tie those.}
<P>__{(jack looks at his shoes)}
<A>__{interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time to take of your jacket and shoes. mmmm? lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. he turns away to join his group.}
