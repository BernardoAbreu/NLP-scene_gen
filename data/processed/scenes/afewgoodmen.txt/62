<D>__{santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. an i getting this right?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{if you feel there are any details that i'm missing, you should free to speak up.}
<A>__{jessep's not quite sure what to say to this navy lawyer lieutenant smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak freely on his own base.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{now it was at this point that you called captain markinson and lt. kendrick into your office?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and what happened then?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{we agreed that for his own safety, santiago should be transferred off the base.}
<A>__{here's something else kaffee didn't know. neither did jo. sam jots something down on a small notepad. markinson doesn't flinch.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{santiago was set to be transferred?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{on the first available flight to the states. six the next morning. three hours too late as it turned out.}
<A>__{kaffee nods.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{there's silence for a moment. kaffee takes a sip of his coffee. then drains the cup and puts it down.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{alright, that's all i have. thanks very much for your time.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{the corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{wait a minute, i've got some questions.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{colonel, on the morning that santiago died, did you meet with doctor stone between three and five?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jo }
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{of course i met with the doctor. one of my men was dead.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(to jo)}
<D>__{see? the man was dead. let's go.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(to jessep)}
<D>__{i was wondering if you've ever heard the term code red.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jo }
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i've heard the term, yes.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{colonel, this past february, you received a cautionary memo from the naval investigative service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a soviet made cuban ml al6 assault rifle. however, the directive having come from the nis, i gave it its due attention. what's your point, jo?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{she has no pointerior she often has no pointerior it's part of her charm. we're outta here. thank you.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{my point is that i think code reds still go on down here. do code reds still happen on this base, colonel?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{yes he does.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no, he really doesn't.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{yeah, he really does. colonel?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{you know it just hit me. she outranks you, danny.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i want to tell you something danny and listen up 'cause i mean this: you're the luckiest man in the world. there is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning. promote 'em all i say.}
<A>__{jo's not upset. jo's not mad. but she's gonna ask her question 'til she gets an answer.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{colonel, the practice of code reds is still condoned by officers on this base, isn't it?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{you see my problem is, of course, that i'm a colonel. i will just have to keep taking cold showers 'til they elect some gal president.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i need an answer to my question, sir.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{take caution in your tone, commander. i'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. you want to know about code reds? on the record i tell you that i discourage the practice in accordance with the nis directive. off the record i tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. i run my base how i run my base. you want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. i eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 cubans who are trained to kill me. so don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous.}
<A>__{a moment of tense silence before }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{let's go. colonel, i will just need a copy of santiago's transfer order.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{santiago's transfer order. you guys have paper work on that kind of thing, i just need it for the file.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{for the file.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{of course you can have a copy of the transfer order. for the file. i'm here to help anyway i can.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{you believe that, don't you? danny? that i'm here to help anyway i can?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{the corporal'll run you by ordinance on your way out to the airstrip. you can have all the transfer orders you want.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(to jo and sam)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{the lawyers start to leave.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{but you have to ask me nicely.}
<A>__{kaffee stops. turns around. sam and jo stop and turn.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{you have to ask me nicely. you see, danny, i can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. i can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear. i don't want money and i don't want medals. what i want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform, and with your harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin' courtesy. you gotta ask me nicely.}
<A>__{kaffee and jessep are frozen. everyone'staring at kaffee; the officers at their tables... kendrick... sam... markinson... jo... kaffee makes his decision.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel jessep... if it's not too much trouble, i'd like a copy of the transfer order. sir.}
<A>__{jessep smiles.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{hold for a moment. jo's very disappointed. jessep stands there and watches the lawyers as they turn and leave the officer's club.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i hate casualties, matthew. there are casualties even in victory. a marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon, that marine's a hero. the foundation of the unit, the fabric of this base, the spirit of the corps, they are things worth fighting for.}
<A>__{markinson looks at the ground.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{dawson and downey, they don't know it, but they're smothering a grenade.}
<A>__{markinson looks up as we}
