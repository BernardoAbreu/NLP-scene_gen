<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{i don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for sure. i'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. need like nothing else i have ever known will soon take hold of me. it's on the way.}
<A>__{the door opens. renton's mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. father watches from the doorway.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{we'll help you, son. you'll stay with us until you get better. we'll beat this together.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{maybe i could go back to the clinic.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{no. no clinics, no methadone. that made you worse, you said so yourself. you lied to us, son, your own mother and father.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{at least get us some tempazepam.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{no, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin. nothing at all.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{it's a clean break this time.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you're staying where we can keep an eye on you.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{i do appreciate what you're trying to do, i really do, but i need just one score, to ease myself off it. just one. just one.}
<A>__{mother retreats past father, who closes the door. the bolts go home again. renton lies back and closes his eyes. his forehead is damp with sweat. he begins to shake. he tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of blankets. as he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed begbie in the bed with him.}
<C>__{begbie}
<D>__{well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. go on, sweat that shite out of your system, because if i come back and it's still there, i will fucking kick it out.}
<A>__{begbie laughs and covers himself up. renton rips away the blankets, but begbie has gone. renton looks up. baby dawn is crawling across the ceiling. renton looks down to see diane sitting on the end of the bed. diane sings 'temptation' by new order.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{'oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and i've never met anyone quite like you before.'}
<A>__{renton looks back up. dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick rail of unidentifiable slime. renton looks down. sick boy sits on the end of the bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. mother stands behind him.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{it's a mug's game, mrs renton. i'm not saying i was blameless myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.}
<A>__{sick boy takes a bit of his biscuit. dawn crawls on. she has fangs now. spud sits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on it, plus a ball and chain. dawn has claws as well. tommy sits on the end of the bed. he looks terrible.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{better than sex, rents, better than sex. the ultimate hit. i'm a fucking adult. i will find out for myself. well, i've found out all right.}
<A>__{renton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. he tears her off and throws her into a corner. renton's mother and father are washing him. mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner, where it landed. she wipes her son's face with it.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{mark, there's something you need to do.}
