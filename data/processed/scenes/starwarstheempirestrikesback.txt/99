<A>__{on the battlefield, luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over him. he looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing overhead. running beneath the monstrous machine, luke fires his harpoon gun at the walker's underside. a thin cable follows the projectile from the gun. the magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull. still running under the walker, luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle. soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker. the walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow. stray laser bolts whistle by luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch. hanging precariously, luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword. he takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the imperial machine. quickly, luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below. he lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by and just misses him. the giant walker stops in mid step. a muffled explosion comes from within and then the walker's mechanical insides are spewed out every conceivable opening. the machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like a locomotive on stilts.}
