<A>__{naeem nods and moves off.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{look, i didn't come up here to rescue anybody. i'm a single mother and i needed a job. and i know you think you're protecting your son, but you're not. i mean, what if arthur ashe's mother had stopped him from playing tennis because it's a "white man's game"?}
