<A>__{open close on a framed photo of glynn and sara (in full ballet costume). embracing. happy. pull back to see sara. sitting on the edge of her futon, holding glynn's clover leaf necklace and staring at her mother's face. lost. lonely. missing her. she kisses the lucky charm, smiles at glynn, slips the necklace on.}
<L>__{interior exterior car wash day}
<A>__{patrick, in coveralls, slouches over a mechanic's station studying. a few workers mill about, waiting for the next car on a slow day. a bmw with tinted windows peels into the lot on two wheels. patrick looks up as malakai and a tall, wiry, nattily dressed man get out.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i got it.}
<A>__{he exits into the lot. approaches malakai and the man ("tute").}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{medicine man. you know tute.}
<A>__{tute takes in patrick. looks around. snickers derisively.}
<C>__{tute}
<D>__{you call this a job, man?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{actually, i call it a car wash. the work i do, yeah, that's a job.}
<A>__{malakai lets out a nervous laugh. tute doesn't crack a smile.}
<C>__{tute}
<D>__{i need some sticks. watch my ride, malakai.}
<A>__{tute enters the cashier's office. patrick looks at malakai.}
<C>__{patrick}

<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{i got sense enough to know who i am, what i can do and where i can do it. i ain't like you. people don't just up and hand me shit.}
<A>__{tute emerges from cashier's office lighting a cigarette from a fresh pack. he blows a plume of smoke into the air, regards patrick.}
