<D>__{hi, i'm jim and i'm the spokesperson for the coca cola company. i'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. i'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, i'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. it's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it i can say. we changed the can around a little bit. see, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. so that's it, it's coke. everyone knows it. it's very famous. i'm jim, i work for coke, and i'm asking you to not stop buying coke. that's all. thanks.}
