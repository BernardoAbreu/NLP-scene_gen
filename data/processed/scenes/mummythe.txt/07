<L>__{exterior sahara hamanaptra ruins (1925) day}
<A>__{imhotep's horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg}
<B>__{horseman.}
<A>__{racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. armed to the teeth. superimposed across the screen are the words:}
<D>__{the sahara 1925}
<A>__{a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. our hero is up on the wall. his kepi sits at a jaunty angle. dashing and handsome. this is rick o'connell. he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at him.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i knew this was gonna be a lousy day.}
<A>__{a doughy little frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of the wall. this is beni.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{personally, i would like to surrender. why can we not just surrender?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{shut up and gimme your bandolier.}
<A>__{beni pulls off his cartridge belt. hands it to o'connell.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{then let's run away. right now. while we can still make it.}
<A>__{o'connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{now gimme your revolver, you'll never use it anyway.}
<A>__{beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to o'connell.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{then let's play dead, huh? nobody ever does that anymore.}
<A>__{o'connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{now go find me a big stick.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{in the desert? what for?}
<A>__{o'connell turns and goes nose to nose with him.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{so i can tie it to your back, you appear to be without a spine.}
<A>__{the horde of warriors thunders forward. now a half mile out. scimitars rattling. o'connell and beni run through the ruins.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{how'd a guy like you end up in the legion anyways?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{i got caught robbing a synagogue. lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{altar boys?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{exactly! i speak seven languages, including hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. how about you? kill somebody?}
<A>__{beni trips and accidentally tackles o'connell to the ground. o'connell gives him a nasty look.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{no, but i'm considering it.}
<A>__{they get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{what then? robbery? extortion? kidnapping!}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{none of the above, thank you.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{then what the hell are you doing here!?}
<A>__{they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of warriors. the sound of charging horses is deafening. o'connell gives beni a big cheesy smile.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i was just looking for a good time.}
<A>__{and that's when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics, cuts and runs. o'connell instantly stiffens.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{oh shit. steady!}
<A>__{gives the men around him courage. but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding the sand. several more legionnaires take off.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{steady!}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what the hell am i sayin'?}
<A>__{the tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo loo loog screams. more legionnaires haul ass. beni is one of them.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{steady!!}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what the hell am i doin'?}
<A>__{the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. o'connell steels himself, cocks and locks. the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps, he spits it into the sand. another beat. and then }
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the legionnaires on the ground fire. the rifles report with a crash. the blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts. the prone legionnaires quickly begin to reload.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the kneeling legionnaires fire. more tuaregs bite the sand. the remaining warriors open fire. thunder and smoke rip the hot air. a third of the legionnaires are killed instantly.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the remaining standing legionnaires fire. tuaregs spin off their mounts. crash to the sand. and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins and through the legionnaires. o'connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts clubbing riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed. beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering in full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him. he crawls through the front gate. o'connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. he cross draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts. beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the rocks. he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires are shot off their feet behind him. o'connell's guns go empty.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<A>__{he turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate. four tuareg warriors on massive arabians haul ass after him. o'connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running. he spots beni inside the temple doorway, trying to close the heavy sandstone door.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{hey! beni! wait up!}
<A>__{beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{what are ya doing?! wait up!}
<A>__{o'connell runs faster. beni pushes harder. the four horsemen leap the big column and charge after him. hoofs pounding.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{don't you close that door! don't you close that door!}
<A>__{beni closes the door just as o'connell reaches it. o'connell slams his body into the door. it doesn't budge.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i'm gonna get you for this!}
<A>__{he turns and bolts off around the rocks. running for his life, weaving through the ruins. the arabians getting closer and closer. the pounding hoofs getting louder and louder. o'connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off. o'connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird. and that's when the horses go ape shit. all four of them rear up. two of the riders are thrown to the ground. the horses screech and bellow and snort in fear, then buck like fury and haul ass away as if the devil himself had scared them. the thrown riders get up and race off after their mounts. o'connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right hand and checks out his middle finger. and then he feels the evil himself, and turns around. the shattered, decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him. suddenly, the sand begins to shift under o'connell's feet. he starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it, forming lines and shapes, drawing a picture. o'connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. the sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the sand, is a picture of imhotep's screaming face.}
