<A>__{we are inside a human brain. a pack of neurons fire off to the left, and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve. passing the eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the retina) on which we see an image projected:}
<B>__{an upside down computer screen}
<A>__{neurons ping into the membrane: the picture suddenly flips right side up and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse pov and exterior the world as we know it day}
<B>__{close on a pair of eyes}

<A>__{they are facing the capsule elevator that leads to the tunnel.}
