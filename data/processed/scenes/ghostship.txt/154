<A>__{epps and murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the ship.}
<L>__{interior arctic warrior first mate's quarters day}
<A>__{greer stops before a mirror to see himself. he finds an aspirin bottle, goes to open it. and as he does so, he sees that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.}
<L>__{interior arctic warrior engine room day}
<A>__{dodge works over the turbine. he stops, holding there. he looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. a beat. he begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, yanking them loose, breaking them off.}
<L>__{interior chimera radio room day}
<A>__{the chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty assortment of tubes and condensers. murphy looks on at it.}
<B>__{with epps}
<A>__{a tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten corner. epps picks it up. the cover has been ripped off and the pages are torn. but, as she looks through it, she sees that it is the ship's log.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{murphy.}
<A>__{murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the very end. the last pages have been ripped out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{looks like part of the general log.}
<A>__{epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{"the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{february first.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the same day she supposedly went down.}

<D>__{must not've been the captain's entry. he was probably out of the picture by then.}
<A>__{epps continues to read.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{"their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. distress calls have been made."}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{collision? with what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the page's missing. then their sos was real.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{but where's the damage?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe the other ship took the worst of it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{if it was a ship she hit.}
<A>__{a beat as they hold there, when his radio crackles to life.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{dodge to murphy!}
<A>__{murphy reaches down for his radio.}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(to radio)}
