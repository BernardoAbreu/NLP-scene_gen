<L>__{interior chicken coop night}
<A>__{two of the kids, walter and jeffrey, are sitting in a corner, talking quietly, urgently.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{walter and jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming. they were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid. they kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up.}
<A>__{they pull at the wiring. part of the roof weakens and dust sifts down.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{they figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get out of there and run... but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasn't wide enough, we'd be stuck. it might even bring the whole place down.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{we gotta try it!}
<C>__{first winslow boy}
<D>__{no! what he hears }
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{we have to get out of here!}
<C>__{first winslow boy}
<D>__{i'm afraid!}
<A>__{and in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he saw her:}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm not. i'm not afraid of anything.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't you want to go home? don't you want to see your mom again?}
<A>__{the winslow kids nod, and start crying. jeffrey and walter look to the rest.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{anybody else?}
<A>__{david holds up his hand.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{okay. anybody who doesn't want to come, get over at that end in case this comes down.}
<A>__{the winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end, too terrified to try and escape. jeffrey, david and walter go to the weakened corner of the coop.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{when we get out, we split up, go in different directions, they can't catch all of us. ready?}
<A>__{they nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the wire framework.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{pull!}
<A>__{they do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the ceiling shifts above them, dirt falling all over the place... they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still pulling...then suddenly the corner falls away, part of the roof starting to come down with it. the noise is substantial.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{changeling a true story they race out the opening, jeffrey first, then walter, then david...but just as the first two get clear }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{walter turns to see david stuck in the wiring. lights go on around the ranch. he hesitates...then runs back to david, helps to untangle him. they hear a shotgun blast, and feet running their way.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{walter gets him untangled, and the two race away from the coop, running for all they're worth as a flashlight hits first one, then the other. they run and david catches one last glimpse of walter running, heading for the line of trees....}
<C>__{ybarra }
<D>__{and that's the last you saw of him?}
