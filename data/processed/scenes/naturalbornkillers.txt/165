<L>__{exterior county jail day}
<A>__{the doors swing wide in slow motion as the caravan of mickey, mallory, wayne and duncan take their first step into the open air. a crescent of deputies frame the group in the b.g. while wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind mickey. freeze frame on wide angle. image dissolves to black & white before burning into white}
<B>__{leader.}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{the white leader is disrupted by a fogged image in black & white. the image settles into a ecu of wayne. he's being filmed by a 16mm camera that he is presently balancing on a fence post. this entire scene is played out cinema verite. the sound is not in sync as wayne steps back into a med shot. he looks directly into the camera.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{this is wayne gayle. i'm wounded and my crew, roger and scott, are dead. this may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. mickey knox's plan worked. we walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway. when we were followed by patrol cars, mallory knox killed deputy sheriff duncan homolka and tossed his body out of the back. mickey told authorities over my police band that i would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. they took mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. why helicopters weren't employed, i don't know. my only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made. we've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview. tensions run high }
<A>__{mickey screams o.s.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{we ain't got all fuckin' day!}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{without any further ado, mickey and mallory...}
<A>__{wayne steps forward and picks up the camera and while conducting his interview, the camera remains hand held. camera focuses on mallory sitting on a stump, while mickey paces in and out of frame in the b.g.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mallory, what did you think of mickey's plan? did you think it would work?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{it wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. when we got out of the stairwell, i remember thinking, 'oh my god. this might work.' but mickey knew it would work all along. there wasn't any doubt in his mind. it's not like there was and he just didn't show it. he knew it would work.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{what did you think then?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{i wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. and i wondered if i could wait that long.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word i said? ...oh, i'm sorry. can i say fuckin'? i can't, can i?}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{try to keep it to a minimum.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{we had nothing to do with that riot. that riot was just whatchmacallit }
<A>__{mickey can be heard faintly in the b.g.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{divine intervention.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{what he said. we didn't know jack shit about and riot. it just happened. it was kismet. we didn't even know those people. how are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i mean, it's not like we care. if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. it won't exactly keep us up at night. but you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.}
<A>__{mickey's snapping his fingers in the b.g.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{c'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{so, what now?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{well, now me and mickey are gonna take it easy. just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{how do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in america.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{so, you kids out there, keep the faith. cause mickey and mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{okay, that's enough. end of interview. we gotta move.}
<A>__{mickey approaches wayne. camera goes a little haywire as wayne lowers it from his eye.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions. and then i will do my little wrap up.}
<A>__{mickey takes the camera from wayne, and while he speaks, he balances it on a fence post.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right. but it won't be you starin' in the camera, looking dumb, and acting stupid. instead, you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers.}
<A>__{wayne forces a chuckle. mickey steps away from the camera and into a three shot. the news van is parked in the b.g.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's a joke right?}
<A>__{mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. mallory grabs her shotgun from off the ground.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{just wait one fucking minute.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i said i'd give you a interview. now unless i'm mistaken, we just did a interview.}
<P>__{(to mallory)}
<D>__{we did an interview, didn't we?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{looked like an interview to me.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i said we'd give you an interview. i never said we wouldn't kill you.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wait! i don't know, but i kinda felt during this...this whole escape that a kind of bond }
<A>__{wayne is shaking.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{...developed between the three of us. we're kindda in this together, don't ya think?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{don't touch those triggers! please. i think i've already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a dead...way gayle. i was your passport out of jail, not duncan homolka. but me! i will be your passport outta }
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{just save your breath, wayne. we hate you. if anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.}
<A>__{wayne is grasping for anything.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wait! you can't kill me. mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{we are.}
<P>__{(points to camera)}
<D>__{your camera.}
<A>__{mickey turns to mallory.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(john wayne voice)}
<D>__{let's make a little music, colorada.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{the two interview subjects start pumping rounds into wayne, who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground. mickey and mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing into the news van, they drive away. wayne's body lay peacefully in frame until the camera eventually runs out of film.}
