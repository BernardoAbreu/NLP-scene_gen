<L>__{interior imada farmhouse night}
<A>__{hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table, as snow drifts down beyond the window. plates and flatware. glasses and napkins. slowly, in silence, as if a ritual bonding mother and daughter. she glances to the next room... ...her mother fujiko plays with the babies. her father hisao reads the paper. smoking his pipe. and hatsue is motionless for a moment. watching him.}
<L>__{interior imada farmhouse day}
<A>__{close on hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her fear.}
<C>__{hisao }
<D>__{we are loyal.}
<A>__{pull back to see the room. hatsue and her sisters side by side, staring at the table. on it rests a shotgun, four boxes of shells, a ceremonial sword. an fbi agent, a small man in a dark suit, is tagging each item. he wears a light, perpetual, insincere smile.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{everyone on the island has these things.}
<A>__{fujiko at her husband's side. she is quietly indignant. he is frightened.}
<C>__{agent }
<D>__{well, they'll hold this stuff for a little bit, then ship it back to you. it's nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{and walks over to the tansu, a chest of drawers, and begins to remove items...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{you folks have been real polite, and we'll be outta your hair in just a second...}
<A>__{...a silk kimono with gold brocaded sash...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{that's very nice. from the old country, it appears. very high class.}
<A>__{and lays it on another table. next to a bamboo flute, a stack of shakuhachi sheet music.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{these are real nice things. they'll take special care of 'em.}
<A>__{hisao sees his wife's sudden alarm. and, as respectfully as he can manage...}
<C>__{hisao}
<D>__{the flute is precious. the kimono, the music. must you take th...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{...oh yeh, any old country stuff, we have to take.}
<A>__{and sees on the sofa, an open album. strolls over.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{this is only my daughter's scrapbook. for her memories.}
<A>__{so he picks it up. doesn't see hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway...}
<C>__{agent }
<D>__{wilson? don't go pawing through the underwear!}
<A>__{and chuckles. he knows they appreciate a joke. it means there's nothing to be afraid of. stops turning pages now. looks up, his eyes moving until they find hatsue.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{strawberry princess, huh? you musta been flattered by that. looks just like y...}
<A>__{the soft slamming of a screen door. another agent, large and shambling in his too small suit, is carrying a crate. and a telling look.}
<P>__{agent #2 (quiet triumph)}
<D>__{dynamite. twenty four sticks.}
<A>__{and the crate bangs onto the table. just beside the kimono. lifts out two sticks and holds them high. proof.}
<C>__{hisao}
<D>__{you must believe. this for tree stumps. for clearing land.}
<A>__{the small man's smile fades now. first time. and his eyes fix hisao before he speaks. as if reading his mind.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{maybe. maybe. but this is still bad, y'see.}
<A>__{fujiko slips her hand into her husband's. to give him strength.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{it's illegal contraband, you were s'posed to turn this stuff in. we, uh...}
<A>__{slight shrug.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{we gotta arrest you. have to take you to seattle.}
<A>__{fujiko's breath catches. one of the daughters whimpers. the silence hangs thick and frightening. the bigger agent unhooks a pair of handcuffs from his belt, but...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{naw, you don't need those. mister eee ma da san here is a class act, a real gentleman.}
<A>__{the younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters. the agent regrets this.}
<C>__{fujiko}
<D>__{please, reconsider. he has done no bad th...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{well, nobody knows that yet, do they? so, best for an honest man to clear his name for godd and all.}
<A>__{ain't that right?}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{only a few questions in seattle, okay? few questions, few answers, the whole thing is over.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on hisao's arm. not roughly, but much firmer than the ease of his voice...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{simple as that.}
