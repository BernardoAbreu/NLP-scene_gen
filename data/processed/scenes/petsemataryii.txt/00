<L>__{interior lemarche castle, tomb night (1865)}
<A>__{a storm is raging outside. we hear the clap and roll of thunder. tomb stairway rats scurry away down the scum covered steps as the glow of a lantern and footsteps herald someone's arrival...}
<B>__{genvieve lemarche}
<A>__{emerges around the bend. mid 30s. cultured beauty. her dress and face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? god only knows what's happened to her. genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open window.}
<B>__{window}
<A>__{lightning streaks across the night sky outside. we catch a glimpse of the moon disappearing behind the clouds. genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. the tomb itself. water trickles in through cracks in the lichen covered walls, pooling on the tomb floor. genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything... in front of her is anton lemarche's stone sarcophagus. genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb. she reaches the other hand towards a scum covered plaque, brushing the grime away... thunder and lightning reach a crescendo as... a skeletal hand rises out of the water, reaching for her. genvieve screams. the lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out. the hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead... genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.}

<D>__{cut! thank you, renee. can we throw some light on the set?}
<C>__{genvieve}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<A>__{suddenly it is lighter. genvieve can't stop laughing. the groping monster hand disappears back beneath the water. we pull back, revealing it's not 1865. the lemarche castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie set. we are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline should really read...}
