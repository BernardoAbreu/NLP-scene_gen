<A>__{the cemetery is set up for a funeral. there are various navy officers and their families in the chairs. at the back of it all stands jack wearing sunglasses, his face a mask into which it is impossible to read any emotion of any kind. there are four graves and four coffins, two adult sized and two small ones. admiral crawford addresses the mourners.}
