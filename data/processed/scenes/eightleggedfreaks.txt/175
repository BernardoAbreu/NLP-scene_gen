<A>__{sam lifts the motorcycle upright and climbs on. she starts it and revs the engine. ashley leaps aboard. sam accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. the bike's headlight illuminates their path. the male tarantula scurries after the bike. sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. ashley hangs on tight. they've put some distance between themselves and the male tarantula. a dead end looms before them. ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180. sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula. ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction.}
