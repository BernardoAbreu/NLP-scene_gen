<D>__{december 24th: i was in the mess. it was about half past ten when we heard the first explosion.}
<A>__{a massive explosion shakes the building to its very core, its windows shattering and hooded pendulum lights swinging.}
<L>__{exterior larkhill lounge night flashback}
<A>__{men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into the yard.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{the ones at the front ran straight into the gas. it was horrible.}
<A>__{they drop to the ground, gasping and vomiting. the back door is kicked open, dr. surridge following two guards.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{a few of us made it out through the rear door. you could hear men screaming everywhere. i hate the sound of men screaming.}
<A>__{she looks out, men running, collapsing, dying in a yellow green haze that seems everywhere.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{in the center of the camp, everything was on fire. everyone running in all directions. we had hardly enough time to get our bearings when the ovens exploded.}
<A>__{another explosion wracks the compound. the pillar of flame rises into the black sky, dwarfing the men in the camp. dr. surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block, its insides turned out like an unholy birth.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{it was the man in room rive. i couldn't have known. the chemical supplies, grease solvents, ammonia, fertilizer. he'd been making things with them.}
<A>__{close on a soldier, doubled over, hacking up bile.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{mustard gas...}
<A>__{a sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura flame.}
<C>__{delia}
<D>__{and napalm.}
<A>__{dr. surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard, backlit by a curtain of fire.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{and in the yard, i saw him. he had the flames behind him. he was naked.}
<A>__{the man stops.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{he looked at me...}
<A>__{dr. surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look away.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{as if i were an insect. oh god. as if i were something mounted on a slide.}
<A>__{the flames convulse hypnotically behind him.}
<C>__{delia }
<D>__{he looked at me.}
