<D>__{adios don fabio. i will do my best.}
<A>__{and with that, fabio exits the garden. don luis watches him, sad to see his friend go. sighs deeply, pours himself a whiskey, downs it, turns to marco.}
<C>__{don luis}
<D>__{kill this motherfucker.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back, the driver in the front. they see fabio very contained, calm, walking towards them. the driver turns the engine on. fabio slips into the passenger seat. the car takes off. fabio explodes. smashes the dashboard. over and over.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{this fucker! the motherfucker!}
<A>__{he keeps banging the dash.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{not ok boss?}
<C>__{fabio}

<L>__{exterior cat's home day}
<A>__{fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. fabio exits to three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. the gunmen from the car take defensive positions. fabio runs up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior cat's home day}
<A>__{cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. she senses a storm coming. fabio bursts in. his wife sees his tension filled face.}

<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{we've got ten minutes.}

<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{cataleya, go pack!}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i'm packed mama.}
<A>__{cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. watches as fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame, comes over to cat.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{listen to me my darling. just in case of anything. this...}
<A>__{he holds the chip up.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{this is your passport. do you understand?}
<A>__{she nods. he places the chip in her hand, takes a card out of his pocket.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{you find yourself alone? you go to the address on this card. show it to the man at the front gate.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't understand papa.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{you don't have to understand. you just have to listen, and remember.}
<A>__{as cat looks at the chip.}
<L>__{exterior cat's home day}
<A>__{as fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two suv's come rolling down the street. their fingers work the triggers of their weapons. the two suv's roll up. the blacked out windows roll down.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(polite. smiling)}
<D>__{hola. we want to see don fabio.}
<C>__{bodyguard}
<D>__{he's not home.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you mind if we wait?}
<C>__{bodyguard}
<D>__{your time.}
<L>__{interior cat's home day}
<A>__{fabio writes on top of cat's drawing, rips the page off, folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around his neck, drapes it over hers.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{and this will keep you safe.}
<A>__{cat looks down at the medal.}
<B>__{close on the medal}
<A>__{an imprint of a flower.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{the cataleya orchid. it comes from one place on earth. our place. my mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. every morning i would wake up to the sight of them. the smell of them. that's why i named you after them. it reminds us of who we are.}
<A>__{he kisses her on the forehead. his wife appears at the doorway with two suitcases.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<L>__{exterior cat's home day}
<A>__{the man in the suv is on the phone.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{they said he's not home yet.}
<A>__{he listens.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{ok. ok.}
<A>__{he hangs up. puts his phone back in his pocket. walks up to fabio's men.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{change of plans.}
<A>__{he pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.}
<L>__{interior cat's home day}
<A>__{as they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. they see another black suv rushing up the street.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{back!}
<A>__{he pushes his family back inside. fabio runs to the window. sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. as the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door...}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{too late. get ready!}
<A>__{the mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm cat.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{i love you very much.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i love you too papa.}
<A>__{close on fabio's hand reaches under the table where cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. next to the gun is a big knife. and then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{alicia!}
<A>__{his wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. she tosses one to fabio. both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door.}
<B>__{angle on cat}
<A>__{sitting at the table, very still. watching.}
<B>__{angle on her mother and father}
<A>__{facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come. but they never get the chance because... bbbbrrrraaaakkkkkk!!!!!!!! machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. tearing the orchid plants there to shred. cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. their blood splattering across the room, across her. and then... silence. silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. cat just sits in her chair. and then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. cat. marco enters.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you in the kitchen. you, the bedroom. you, the back.}
<A>__{the gunmen scatter. marco has his inquisitive eye on cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. one of the gunman strides over to cat, jams a gun to her head. cat does not move a muscle. does not blink.}
<B>__{angle on marco}
<A>__{examines the frame fabio dug the chip out of. angle on the gunman with the gun to cat's head he chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{hey! what are you doing?}
<A>__{as the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, marco strides over to cat. the frame in his hand.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{don luis said kill everyone.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{he also said no names.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{she won't remember.}
<A>__{he is about to pull the trigger.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the gunman stops.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{she's a kid.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what do you mean so what? you take a kid, teach them, they have value.}
<A>__{the gunman takes his gun, lifts cat's lip, looks at her teeth.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{i couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street.}
<A>__{the gunman is about to pull the trigger again.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{are you stupid or what? here.}
<A>__{marco hands him some cash.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{here's twenty asshole. go do your job.}
<A>__{scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart, looking for something. marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of cat as he sits opposite her. her hands are in her lap.}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{remember me cataleya?}
<A>__{cat shakes her head no.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i was at your confirmation. my name is marco, and i was a very good friend of your father. i see he gave you his medal.}
<A>__{alluding to the medal around her neck.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{the cataleya orchid. his symbol. your name. that's good. this way you will always remember him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.}
<A>__{all the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. this is one of them. but i am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. so you understand. now, you know who don luis is?}
<A>__{cat responds, shakes her head yes. her hand slips imperceptibly under the table.}
<B>__{close on her hand}
<A>__{touches the handle of the knife taped there.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{of course you do. he was your father's best friend since they're kids. he's like an uncle to you. you know he has always been good to your family, don't you?}
<A>__{again cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. even your school fees. all this comes from don luis. you know that?}
<A>__{again cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{but when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. things like...}
<A>__{he alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{cat looks from the bodies and back to marco, no emotion in her eyes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i know you are a smart girl. you do well in school. so i know this is not too complicated for you to understand. am i right?}
<A>__{cat nods.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{good. now, your father had something that belonged to don luis. a little thing. no bigger than...}
<A>__{he holds up his thumbnail.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this. maybe it was in this.}
<A>__{he holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of the wood.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{do you know what i am talking about?}
<A>__{cat nods. close on cat's hand gripping the knife handle.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{excellent. do you know where it is?}
<A>__{cat nods.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{well, if you give it to me, don luis will be very grateful. and very generous. he will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. you will have everything you want.}
<C>__{marco }
<D>__{but if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. and you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?}
<A>__{cat nods yes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{so why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. will you do that?}
<A>__{cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from underneath the table, her fist closed tight. marco smiles, kindly. he holds out his hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you are a smart girl.}
<A>__{marco opens his hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{and in this life, smart girls get everything they want. what do you want cat?}
<A>__{and just as she is about to open her hand...}
<B>__{close on her other hand}
<A>__{under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped there.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?}
<A>__{in a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into marco's unsuspecting, open palm. driven with such force, the knife pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the table beneath; pinning his hand. marco wants to scream but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.}
<C>__{cat}
<P>__{(in his ear)}
<D>__{to kill don luis!}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{aaarrrggghhhh!!!!!}
<A>__{the men searching look up, and before they can react, cat races past them.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{get her!}
<B>__{track with cat}
<A>__{as she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her onto the ledge of a very small window. as she looks back, she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. and she jumps, head first. barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window. and she drops... six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. she flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father.}
<B>__{on the bathroom}
<A>__{one of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... bbbbrrrraaaakkkkkkk!!!!!! lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. coming inches from ripping into them. and then the barrage stops.}
<B>__{on the gunman}
<A>__{his clip runs out. and as he fumbles to slam another one in...}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she hears the pause. looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. she looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running.}
<B>__{on the gunman}
<A>__{gets the clip to fit, sees cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. he lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. the gunman turns to marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{we need her alive!}
<L>__{exterior favela day}
<A>__{cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof.}
<B>__{angle on the gunmen}
<A>__{jumping down from the window of cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.}
<L>__{exterior favela day}
<A>__{marco exits cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{go! go!}
<A>__{he orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. the souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. she sprints across to a small door. she kicks at the door, which gives way and enters...}
<B>__{an open courtyard}
<A>__{where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. they look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. and neither does cat. she just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. one of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{they crash through the vegetable garden. the old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. it falls in between the rows of tomato vines. when the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. the fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. and the fifth man, looks at the old man. knows what he has done. shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{they enter the laundry yard. the women don't even look up. the gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. race back out.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. at the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. the riders see cat, as she sees them. they turn their bikes into the alley... vrrooom! and bear down on cat. cat sprints back up the hill. she goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. the bikes eat up the hill. cat's legs are no match for them. it seems she will be caught any second. she ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. as cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets...}
<B>__{and the concealed metal pipe catches them across their throats. on cat}
<A>__{she looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill.}
<B>__{and just as she does...}
<A>__{marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen on board, comes rolling up the road. he sees cat.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{the jeep screeches around. cat dashes down an alley.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on either side.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{the alley is too narrow for the jeep. the men spill out, spring up the alley.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{alive!}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she runs up the alley, then ducks down another one. she comes to a ladder that leads up a fence, begins to climb.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{running up the alley, turning into the next one. where they see the ladder. one of the gunmen pulls out his cell phone.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{in the jeep, scouting as it rolls along.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she is running for all she is worth, out of breath, scared.}

<A>__{more thugs on bikes, on foot, in cars. they are everywhere.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she is leaning against a wall on a rooftop, gulping air, when she hears the roar of engines. looks over the side of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area.}

<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{hearing them coming.}
<B>__{on gunmen}
<A>__{surrounding a building. throwing grappling hooks onto the roof ledge.}

<C>__{marco}
<D>__{north! go north! we're cutting off the southern streets!}
<A>__{marco slams his phone shut. heads for his car.}
<B>__{on gunmen}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{north!}
<A>__{the gunmen clear the roof. as the last one leaves, he takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof, cannot figure where this wisp of a girl went to. his eyes briefly focus on the chimney...}

<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{he clambers over the side of the roof.}
<B>__{the camera stays focused on the chimney.}
<L>__{interior chimney day}
<A>__{cat, holding her breath, listening keenly to the sound of the men departing, is wedged into the chimney, her hands and feet clinging like a lizard to the walls on either side.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney, mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress. the doors and windows all along the street are shuttered tight. her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down the street. when she hears the sound of a vehicle. she looks up to a jeep turning the corner.}
<B>__{reverse on marco}
<A>__{in the windshield of the jeep, staring at her.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{we got her! close the net!}

<A>__{a bit stunned.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what is she doing?}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she keeps sprinting toward the jeep. another jeep appears over the hill behind her. starts to come at her.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{as his jeep speeds right for her.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. she has a plan. and she executes it. suddenly, she leaps for the curb and...}
<B>__{a sewer grate. on marco}
<A>__{sees cat dive to the curb.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{no!}
<B>__{on cat}
