<L>__{interior bedroom continuous action}
<A>__{burnett exits the closet to find julie brushing out her wet hair, wearing nothing but what she described, a t shirt and pair of lowrey's boxers tied up with a shoe string. this ensemble never looked so good.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{mug shots. we got mug shots to look at. 'scuse me, i gotta hook into the p.d. computer.}
<A>__{he heads out of the bedroom.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{hey, mike. who's the guy in all the pictures?}
<A>__{burnett turns. and there behind julie is a wall full of photos that he's never, ever noticed. nearly all of lowrey. all ego.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{that guy? well, that's marcus burnett, my partner.}
<A>__{burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds the singular photo of the two of them. it's in a shitty frame, too.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{there's the two of us, see? me'n'...}
<P>__{(gestures to photos)}
<D>__{... my partner.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{listen, mike. i've known a lotta guys. and i've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? but i've never seen... i mean, look at it. it's like a shrine to him.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{yeah. okay. sure, i can see how it looks that way... but you see... you see... it's uh... a cop thing.}
<P>__{(then it comes)}
<D>__{that's because i've put a picture up there for every time marcus has saved my life.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{saved your life?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i save his life. he saves mine. he's got the same thing in his house. pictures of me. more, even. good family man, that marcus.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{okay, but mike. this is like a lot of pictures. i mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. this is a whole wall... and i know max said you were just friends. that's why i was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay.}
<A>__{burnett reacts, then recovers with...}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{me? gay? are you outta your mind?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i didn't mean to offend you.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{it's a good thing that i'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. you know how many women i've had in that waterbed? check the waves as they go by. count 'em.}
<P>__{(turns back to living room)}
<D>__{now, mug shots?}
