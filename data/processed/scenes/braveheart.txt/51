<L>__{exterior lanark village night}
<A>__{the villagers are still excited by what just happened; at the blacksmith's forge, men tend to campbell's wound...}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{pour it straight into the wound. i know it seems a waste of good whiskey, but indulge me.}
<A>__{they obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run it through campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. there is a terrible sizzle, and campbell reacts to the pain.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{ah. now that'll clear your sinuses, lads.}
<A>__{campbell looks down at his left hand. his thumb is missing!}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{well bloody hell, look at this! now it's nothing but a fly swatter.}
<A>__{wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. hamish moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. wallace looks at his friend, and looks away; killing the magistrate did not bring marion back. shouts of alarm: armed men are coming! the farmers scramble for their weapons, ready to fight; even campbell jumps up; but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could find for weapons. their leader is macgregor.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{macgregor from the next valley!}
<A>__{macgregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.}
<C>__{macgregor}
<D>__{we heard about what was happenin'. and we don't want ya thinkin' ya can have your fun without us.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{go home. some of us are in this, i can't help that now. but you can help yourselves. go home.}
<C>__{macgregor}
<D>__{we'll have no homes left when the english garrison at the castle comes through to burn us out.}
<A>__{they all look at wallace.}
