<A>__{the car pulls up. another follows it. armed men leap out from both. the earplug wearer indicates they should go down an alley at the side of a service door. they advance cautiously, guns at the ready. they see no one. the earplug wearer indicates another, even narrower, alley leading off to one side. two of the men sneak cautiously up to it, their guns at the ready. a large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage bins. furious, they fire. the bullets rip the bins to shreds, scattering refuse everywhere. the rat is killed. they all stare in disbelief.}
