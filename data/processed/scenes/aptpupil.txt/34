<L>__{interior high school gymnasium day}
<A>__{todd is shooting baskets with joey. it is after school. todd wears a white t shirt. off to the side, we see the dress shirt he was wearing earlier and his school bag.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{so what are you going to do?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck if i know.}
<A>__{todd throws up a clumsy shot. it misses.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you're throwing it flat. let it roll off your fingers more.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(snapping at him)}
<D>__{i don't need a lesson.}
<A>__{todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway. he shoots again. no good.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{your dad, man. i don't know. i mean, i'm a fuck up. my dad is used to this crap from me.}
<A>__{todd does not respond to his friend's attempt at humor. he is slamming the ball around with great force. he bounces it hard off the back wall to give himself a rebound. he is mumbling to himself.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you said something?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you're talking to yourself, bowden. it's not the first time i've noticed it. what is going on with you?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{nothing, joey. i fucked up. i'ii fix it. i'ii fix it.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{all right, man. whatever you say. look, i got to get to practice.}
<A>__{no response from todd.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{if you need to talk, you can call me. you know that. i'ii see you around.}
<A>__{joey walks off. todd continues shooting the ball.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{you're talking to yourself, bowden. you're talking to yourself, bowden.}
<A>__{he throws up a shot. it is good.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i'ii fix it. i'ii fix it.}
<A>__{a strange squawking sound is heard. todd doesn't hear it at first, but as the sound grows louder todd stops the ball and looks around. his eyes focus on the area near an open doorway. sunlight streams into the empty gym. todd walks closer, seeing that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled in from outside. he goes up to it. the bird is black. its wing is damaged. it squawks loudly, looking up at todd. todd begins mumbling again. he starts to dribble the ball thoughtlessly. as his words become clearer, the bouncing gets harder.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i will fix it. i will fix it. i will fix it.}
<A>__{todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him. the bird continues to scream. slowly the ball drifts from beside todd to in front of him, gaining force with every bounce. he brings it up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his might. when it comes back up, it is smeared with blood. he throws it down again, this time it comes up with feathers smeared in the blood. the squawking has stopped. blood splatters on todd's shirt. his eyes close. he stops the ball, looks around. no one has seen him. he notices his shirt. calmly, he tears it off, wraps the ball in it, and tosses it in a nearby trash can.}
