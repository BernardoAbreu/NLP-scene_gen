<A>__{the view of interstellar space is spectacular. as standard comes up the steps, the metallic tapping is heard again. standard looks around. then he sees it broussard's corpse floats outside the glass of the dome. it is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically.}
