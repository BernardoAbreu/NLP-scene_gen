<L>__{exterior melanie's home day}
<A>__{melanie drives into the yard. the house is an old colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a controlled wild garden. a figure is bent over a beehive. a large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features. melanie stops the car in the driveway.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(pointing from the car)}
<D>__{there he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the left. that's old bruwer.}
<A>__{they get out of the car and walk towards him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how long have you lived here?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{oh, about twenty one years. i love this house.}
<C>__{bruwer}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{is that you, melanie?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{of course, dad. i want you to meet a friend.}
<C>__{bruwer}
<D>__{does anyone have a friend nowadays?}
<A>__{he straightens up and throws the net over his head and studies ben. mr. bruwer is seventy years old; an interesting face with a goatee beard.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{mr. du toit, dad.}
<C>__{bruwer}
<D>__{do you like bees?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i have nothing against them.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{be careful, i can see philosophy coming.}
<C>__{bruwer}
<D>__{you shut up.}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{let me tell you about bees, and for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose based on the common good. a course from which he cannot be deflected. greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him. he lives solely to serve his fellow bee.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what about individuality, dad?}
<C>__{bruwer}
<D>__{there's the rub, my girl. there's the rub. one of these days i will ask the bees. i'm sure they have the answer. now, you two run along!}
<A>__{he replaces his net and continues with the hive.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{a drink, dad?}
<C>__{bruwer}
<D>__{i've been peeing too much this morning.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(as they walk toward the house)}
<D>__{that's my daddy. melanie and ben enter the house. interior melanie's living room day the bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers, of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings records, african sculptures. on the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous speakers. a settee, a chess set. the furniture is old and well used, dominated by a large leather club chair two big cats sleeping on it. it's civilized pandemonium.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(gesturing to the room)}
<D>__{now you see in what environment i}
<A>__{was spawned.}
<D>__{ben looks at the shelves and smiles.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{please sit down, on that chair.}
<P>__{(pointing to club chair)}
<D>__{that's dad's. drink?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{please. a...}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(interrupts, mischievous)}
<D>__{a brandy?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(looking at her}
<D>__{surprised, then}
<P>__{smiling)}
<D>__{no thanks, a beer will be fine. melanie goes into the kitchen leaving ben. he cannot forget what he heard and what he saw in the court! she returns barefooted, with two beer mugs, and hands one to ben.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{the mugs are the few things that dad brought from germany. he studied philosophy in tubingen and berlin before the last war.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i thought they were german?}
<A>__{melanie sits, her legs propped up on the settee, hugging her knees.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{mr. du toit, tell...}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{please, call me ben.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{all right, ben, tell me, why are you so depressed? you really expect a different verdict?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(disgruntled)}
<D>__{why do you ask? can you understand it?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{of course i understand it. what could they have. i'm not cynical. i'm only trying to be realistic.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{tell me, miss bruwer...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{ben and melanie, that's fair.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(lighting a cigarette)}
<D>__{i will never stop believing. but in this country i've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{exactly. and you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well. you've got to know your enemy first.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's a tall order: 'know injustice... know the enemy.' it seems i have a long haul ahead of me.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{not at all, ben. you have already taken the first steps.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{welcome to south africa!}
<A>__{she smiles.}
