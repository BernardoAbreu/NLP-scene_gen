<A>__{we pan around the neatest and quietest walk up you've ever seen. lots of books on shelves. we find josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. she turns it over and we see it says: "love". she holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.}

<A>__{josie looks around the living room.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{hmm.}
<P>__{(she pretends to}
<D>__{listen to the}
