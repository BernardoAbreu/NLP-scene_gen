<A>__{the drawing board the original plans the drawing board the original plans are lost in a maze of the blandings' extensions, alterations and additions. three shot the three are somewhat exhausted three shot the three are somewhat exhausted, silently looking at the plans. simms wearily runs his hand through his hair.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{we ll... let's just see what we have here. in the first place }
<A>__{the drawing board simms' the drawing board simms' pencil indicates as he talks.}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<D>__{ i'm afraid you've got the upstairs about twice as big as the downstairs.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{it's all those bathrooms.}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<D>__{it is not, it's all those closets.}
<B>__{three shot. three shot.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{by extending this breakfast room you've eliminated the possibility of any stairs going to the second floor.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh, you can just shove those stairs in anywhere.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(patiently; almost paternally)}
<D>__{and, mrs. blandings, on that sewing room, the way you have it now, the chimney stack would come up right through the middle of the room, leaving you with something in the shape of a square doughnut.}
<P>__{(tactfully)}
<D>__{which, of course, might be very warm in winter, but otherwise of doubtful utility.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you could always move the chimney somewhere else, couldn't you?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{we ll...}
<P>__{(rising; resigned to his fate but tactful)}
<D>__{look, i think i know just about what you two have in mind. why don't i go ahead with some preliminary plans and }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(hearty)}
<D>__{you do that, simms, but remember, we've got to hold it down to ten thousand.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(candid)}
<D>__{that, i can tell you right now, is impossible. even with a considerable trimming of the things you've indicated, i don't see how we can bring it in for less than twelve or twelve five.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{twelve five!}
<P>__{(looks at muriel; then)}
<D>__{well, i guess we're not going to quibble about a few pennies one way or the other.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(can't resist)}
<D>__{no, you'll find mr. blandings never quibbles about pennies.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{and uh have you any notions about how you'd like the old place taken down?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a rueful joke)}
<D>__{why don't we just blow on it?}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(wry smile)}
<D>__{there's a good local house wrecker. i will have him contact you.}
<A>__{jim expansively puts his arm around simms' shoulders.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{fine. you just shoot ahead with those plans, and remember, try to keep it down to ten, ten five.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(doubtfully)}
<D>__{well we'll try.}
<A>__{as the blandings walk to the door:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there's one good thing about getting that old relic down. those original beams and everything this time somebody pays us.}
<A>__{as they go out the door:}
