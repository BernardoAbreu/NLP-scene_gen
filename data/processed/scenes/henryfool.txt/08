<L>__{interior henry's apartment night}
<A>__{later. simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then watches as henry unpacks one of his suitcases. it is filled with dozens of old, worn notebooks. henry stacks them on the mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling and bright. simon steps over and looks at... the name tag on the other suitcase: 'henry fool'.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end.}
<A>__{simon looks over and sees... henry's silhouette against the fire. he steps forward into the light and grabs a beer from the six pack on the floor. he hands one to simon. simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his eyes to henry.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{where do you come from?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{nowhere in particular.}
<A>__{he winks at simon, then struts around the room, hugely impressed with himself.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i go where i will and i do what i must.}
<P>__{(stops, drinks)}
<D>__{that's why i'm in trouble. i'm sort've what you might call... 'in exile'.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{why are you in trouble?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{an honest man is always in trouble, simon. remember that.}
<A>__{simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. henry stands in a dim corner across the room.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how do you know my name?}
<A>__{henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. he steps forward and comes face to face with simon. he lifts his finger and points to... simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt. realizing this, simon moves off and thinks. henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his shoulder, laughing mischievously.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(stopping him)}
<D>__{i am not retarded.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{well... i will take your word for that.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{people. i mean. they think. you know. because.}
<A>__{he tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up gesticulating curiously with his hands. this finally dissolves into a dumb stare into empty space.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{simon looks at him. henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece. he tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket. he hands the now fresh writing tablet to simon.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{here. take this. and...}
<A>__{he searches his pockets and finds a pencil.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{...this. keep them with you at all times. you ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down. ok?}
<A>__{simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(proudly, returning)}
<D>__{this? this is my life's work. my memoirs. my 'confession'.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{what have you done?}
<A>__{henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{i've been bad. repeatedly.}
<P>__{(shrugs and steps away)}
<D>__{but why brag? the details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths.}
<P>__{(contemplating the notebooks)}
<D>__{what is this? it's a philosophy. a poetics. a politics, if you will. a literature of protest. a novel of ideas. a pornographic magazine of truly comic book proportions. it is, in the end, whatever the hell i want it to be. and when i'm through with it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world's own idea of itself!}
<A>__{he smokes. simon is impressed. they hear a bottle smash outside in the street and henry goes to the window. they're throwing bottles at the house.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(throwing down his cigarette)}
<D>__{come on, let's go break their arms!}
<A>__{simon jumps up.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{henry stops. simon looks away and sits back down.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{if i'm quiet.}
<A>__{he is ashamed of himself. henry sees this and settles down. he considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. he lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close by simon. they sit there in silence a while, then...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{once. i forget where i was. central america maybe. somewhere hot. stupid job. bad pay. dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it. this crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb. and i say, listen, hombres, ok, you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice i'm gone. fine. but one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out. period. silence. i repeat myself. one of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. i promise. it's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered. but i will succeed. because it's the only thing i have left to do in this world. so why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more.}
<P>__{(smokes, waits)}
<D>__{they sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves.}
<A>__{henry stares into the flames and falls silent. simon is riveted. he leans forward, on the edge of his seat...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(winking)}
<D>__{well, here i am, still, after all.}
