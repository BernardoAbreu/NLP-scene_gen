<A>__{pre dawn: eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. the doors of the first four open in unison. 20 arab, suited security guards exit. al ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. close up: the team steps out to see massive, organized security. from one of the vehicles exits a middle aged american sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. this is us deputy chief of mission, the embassy's second in command: damon}

<C>__{schmidt }
<D>__{don't let go of his hand first. major disrespect.}
<A>__{one of the inner circle, without a word, takes off the fbi emblazoned windbreaker worn by leavitt and places it on a short sleeved janet. careful not to touch skin. only then does prince bin khaled approach. a lone photographer follows: snapping pictures. different definitions of personal space: four inches separation as bin khaled greets each team member in accented english. janet last: the pictures suddenly stop. the prince gives a little curtsy, no words, steps back to fleury: the pictures re start. bin khaled holds fleury's hand sixth grade boyfriend style.}

<D>__{this is our level of commitment to bringing terrorists to justice:}

<P>__{(beat, a stunted nod)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the prince turns back to the convoy. entire entourage follows. one of the security contractors catches the jacket janet hurls back at him, tosses it to leavitt. convoy gone. the team turns: 100 glares again. fleury blinks out the camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs. fleury looks up at a retreating damon schmidt.}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{nice pictures. you guys ready to go home now?}
<A>__{dead eyes from fleury. he's clearly not amused.}
<C>__{schmidt }
<D>__{ok. if you change your minds, i got a plane fueled up and ready to go got your name all over it...}

<C>__{schmidt }

<P>__{(to fleury)}
<D>__{how could they get more secure?}
<A>__{the team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump their bags in a pile, already disgusted. in the distance, the group of sang stare back at our team.}
