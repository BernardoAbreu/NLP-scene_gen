<T>__{intercut:}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{moms sits in silence.}
<C>__{william }
<P>__{(rehearsed)}
<D>__{i'm fine! i'm fine! i'm flying back on monday morning. i will only miss one test. i will make it up.}
<A>__{russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{tell her you're a slave to the groove you can't help it!}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(covers phone)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the other end.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hi mom! it's russell hammond, i play guitar in stillwater! it's my fault. how does it feel to be the mother of the future of rock journalism?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{silence. penny passes and stands near william, smoothing her pass. they watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road crew. they are more glam, more trashy and less selective. they glare insolently at penny lane. this is the future.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{you've got a great kid nothing to worry about! we're taking care of him! and you should come to a show sometime! join the circus!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{listen to me. your charm does not work on me. i'm onto you. of course you like him.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{he worships you people and that's fine with you, as long as he helps make you rich.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(a nerve is struck)}
<D>__{rich? i don't think so }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{listen to me. he's a smart, good hearted, 15 year old kid, with infinite potential.}
<A>__{russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes the truth. he's 15?}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{this is not some apron wearing mother you're talking to. i know about your valhalla of decadence, and i shouldn't have let him go. he is not ready for your world of compromised values, and diminished brain cells that you throw away like confetti. am i speaking clearly to you?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{if you break his spirit, harm him in any way, keep him from his chosen profession which is law, something you may not value but i do you will meet the voice on the other end of this telephone. and it will not be pretty. do we understand each other?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yes... yes...}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(always the teacher)}
<D>__{i didn't ask for this role, but i will play it. now go do your best. "be bold and mighty forces will come to your aide!" goethe said that. it's not too late for you to be a person of substance. get my son home safely, i'm glad we spoke.}
<A>__{she hangs up. russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{some people get her. some don't.}
<A>__{russell is still recovering. william feels embarrassed by his mother, once again.}
<B>__{on the huddle}
<A>__{william with the band. he yawns, as the band breaks. cleveland awaits. we follow dick, who guides the band onto the stage platform, still in darkness. already, stomping and applause is mounting. russell turns to william before taking the stage:}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{your mom kind of freaked me out.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{she means well.}
<A>__{still rattled, he takes the stage. we see the unbridled enthusiasm of the faces on the front row. a wave of cigarette lighters stretch out before them.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(importantly)}
<D>__{from troy, michigan...}
<A>__{russell thwacks a couple chords. audience thunders. he turns to other members, feeling chills. it's in these moments that everything else disappears. they bow and wave, still in darkness... each member seems to have his own fans. dick lets all this play out before finally adding...}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{would you please welcome to cleveland...}
<A>__{more applause. this is very very very very fun.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{stillwater.}
<A>__{lights come up. a full blast of audience love hits them right in the face, as they begin "fever dog." the band charges headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out of the crowd and onto the stage.}
<B>__{handheld on russell}
<A>__{who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his guitar, and uses the instrument to send a frenetic fan back into the crowd. he slips back under the strap, laughing. more stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and russell now watches as jeff bebe dodges a fan and comes over to russell to lean on him. russell turns to share the moment with penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the stage.}
