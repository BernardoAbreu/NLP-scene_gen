<A>__{she hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room. stands, alone in the stillness. hands to her head, mind churning... turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. props her suitcase on the sink and opens it. flips back the mound of clothing and there it is. the pieces, disassembled, of an m 40 sniper rifle. her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their own volition... hefting them. gauging their feel. and then, slowly... terrifyingly... knowing how they go together. she snaps the barrel in place, click ! the sound breaks her reverie. she drops the thing like it's alive. looks down, trembling... also in the case: a wicked looking hunting knife. she picks it up gingerly. shiny, brand new. turns it over in her hand, fascinated by the play of light off the blade... looks up. her reflection, in the mirror. staring back. she frowns it frowns. she turns away the reflection doesn't. it stays right fucking put, except now it's smiling. malignant. deadly. sam feels something wrong. spins back toward the mirror her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. reaches into sam's world and slices for her throat.}
