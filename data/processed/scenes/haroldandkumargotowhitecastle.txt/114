<L>__{exterior police station}
<A>__{harold and kumar (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps. they race through the street and start heading towards a forest.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hurry up!}
<L>__{exterior forest 3:20 am}
<A>__{harold and kumar have stopped running. they start catching their breath.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{jesus christ! that place was a fucking mad house! thanks for getting me out of there, dude.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there.}
<P>__{(beat, re: weed)}
<D>__{dude, look at this. it's like we went from being broke to being millionaires.}
<A>__{suddenly, they hear what sounds like a coyote's howl.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{just a coyote. don't worry.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{that's only because they sound scary. in one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down.}
<A>__{suddenly, a cheetah jumps out from behind a bush and lets out a monstrous roar!}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{now cheetahs, they're another story.}
<A>__{the cheetah stares harold and kumar down.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we're gonna die.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{just calm down. cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. they're not known for eating humans.}
<A>__{with that, the cheetah walks over to a nearby bush and drags out a half eaten human corpse it's obviously been devouring.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we're gonna die.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{okay, i will admit, that's not a good sign. but i'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone.}
<A>__{harold and kumar stand silently. slowly, the cheetah begins walking directly over to harold...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{this isn't working.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{suddenly, the cheetah opens his mouth wide and chomps down on what appears to be harold's groin area.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(eyes closed, screaming)}
<D>__{he's mauling me! he's mauling me!}
<A>__{harold continues screaming for the next ten seconds. eventually, he calms down and looks at the cheetah. the cheetah is not eating harold. he's eating the beef jerky}
<B>__{that harold had in his pants.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{i thought i told you not to take that jerky!}
<A>__{harold simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. the cheetah walks over to harold and begins licking harold's face in friendship.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{he likes me.}
<A>__{suddenly, kumar's eyes light up...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, i think i have an idea.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i will tell you, but first we have to get really high.}
<A>__{kumar opens the bag of weed. pan up to the night sky for a time lapse. we see smoke coming up from below. pan back down...}
