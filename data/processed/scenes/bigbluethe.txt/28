<L>__{exterior lake of the demon camp day}
<A>__{the storm is at its peak. the frozen snowmobile plows along side the lake huacracocha and stops in front of a cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow. frank gets the bags out of the back. the suitcases are by now frozen stiff. johana follows in his steps. a couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm. johana is bewildered. shacks in the middle of the andes, the lake of the "demon", and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter one's home. as frank opens the door, a man is leaving the hut. the man is jacques mayol. johana and jacques pass each other in slow motion. everything seems suddenly suspended: time, sound, cold... jacques mayol instantly makes an impression on her. he is now 34, still dark haired, with dark eyes. he is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles. he looks like some legendary creature one would dream about. everything finally regains its formal speed. the door slams, the man is gone. she and frank are in the middle of the entrance hall. johana hasn't yet gotten over the vision she has just had, but she regains composure and enters the next room.}
