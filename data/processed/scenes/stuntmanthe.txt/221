<A>__{the river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening, shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera and cameron's desperate cries. tearing his seatbelt off he flings himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to reach nina. incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is buoyed to the surface. there, again, is the living world the road, the trees. in that brief instant, through the rear window, cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore nina, standing by the rail looking down, eli beside her. the car noses downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. the last image on cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little girl excitement on nina's face. then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom. cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is total. everyone, even nina, has conspired to bring him to this red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his death. outrage galvanizes him to action. he reaches for the door handles, to rip them open they snap off in his hands. now there is a rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode, crushing down toward him. under the immense pressure, the rear window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. the memory of chuck's voice..."the windows." he lowers the front window slowly. the water now pours in faster. the level has risen to his chin. he gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head. still the red light burns. he reaches beneath the seat for the oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. it won't move. the impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. his groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. a hope. though every second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are as in slow motion. pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. the rubber tube has broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free as it must have with burt. pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the water reaches the roof. for a moment there is a strange stillness which cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and toward the surface.}
