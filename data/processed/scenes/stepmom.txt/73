<L>__{interior elementary school common room night}
<A>__{folding chairs set in rows. parents taking their seats with coffee and cookies. up front, a table where a panel of speakers are beginning to gather. a faded banner says pta tenafly day school. jackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when... ...a figure slips into the seat beside her. rachel is juggling a coffee and maybe nine cookies. drops one. picks it up. dusts it off. jackie is repelled, but has to smile.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{luke's depo ran late. i promised i'd take notes.}
<A>__{to prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a notebook. looks around, and in a conspiratorial near whisper...}

<A>__{rachel breathless and happy. jackie attentive.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{as you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. they don't actually go to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{...going out, yeh. i had kids of my own, once.}
<C>__{rachel}

<A>__{jackie's mouth drops.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{right. which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.}

<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{doesn't begin to describe it. i mean, you've got cancer, this is serious.}
