<L>__{exterior nico's house back yard day}
<A>__{huge trays of italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several "old country" type women. wine is poured from generous carafes. friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church. presents for the new baby are being opened by nico's wife, sara, and nico's mother, rosa.}

<P>__{(winking at the women)}
<D>__{i carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper.}
<A>__{assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem.}
<C>__{nico}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{that's what you get for not marrying a sicilian.}
<A>__{sara lets nico struggle a moment, then takes over.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{my brave husband. he's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants.}
<A>__{toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby.}

<P>__{(indicates nico across the patio)}
<D>__{toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in chicago.}
<A>__{two of nico's uncles branca and luigi, who look like they have been on the other side of a cop's work, are in turn eying lukich and henderson plus a cluster of other cops in civvies hovering around the buffet table like vultures.}
<C>__{branca}
<D>__{look at these stiff dicks. a free meal and they come out like flies.}
<A>__{street outside nico's house day an unmarked police car pulls up. dolores jackson ("jax"), another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters the driveway leading to nico's back yard }
<B>__{back yard}
<A>__{jackson enters. she's impeccably dressed and radiates intelligence. she's greeted warmly by lukich, henderson, strozah, and a couple of other cops.}
<C>__{strozah}
<D>__{i didn't do nothing, counselor. i'm clean.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{eight more days, lieutenant. you better start preparing your defense.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{baby, i'm gonna put you on retainer.}
<C>__{lukich}

<C>__{luigi}
<D>__{now this cop. she can bust me any day.}
<A>__{nick, sara and rosa (nico's mother) jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of nico's stylish attire, kisses sara and greets nico's mom warmly. she starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.}
<B>__{various shots}
<A>__{young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, father genarro dancing with an elderly matron. we see that nico's friends are an electric mix. cops, art y types, people of varied ages and professions.}

<A>__{holding the baby.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{look at this little bundle. what a cupcake!}

<C>__{sara}
<D>__{nico, will you let the woman catch her breath?}
<A>__{japanese woman (dr. watanabe) moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. while jackson and sara continue their "mom" talk, nico edges off toward watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{watanabe! say hey, doc.}
<A>__{they begin jabbering in japanese. we will meet watanabe again later. she's a brainy looking woman reserved, a bit mysterious who talks quietly and intensely in japanese with nico like they're old friends who go back a long way.}
