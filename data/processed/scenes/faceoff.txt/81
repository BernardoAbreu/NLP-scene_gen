<L>__{interior archer's home night}
<A>__{a tired eve opens the door. it's pitch black inside. as she fumbles for the light switch...}
<B>__{match}
<A>__{flares as castor lights a candle. the dining room table is set for a candlelight dinner. he smiles warmly at her confusion.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{don't tell me you forgot. eve it's date night!}
<A>__{dining room later eve looks up from her pasta. after an awkward silence.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{why do i feel like i'm on a blind date?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{it's important to keep some mystery... so things stay... unpredictable.}
<A>__{eve studies him as he pours her more wine. her smile slowly fades as she realizes what's going on.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{'unpredictable'? you're about as unpredictable as the tide.}
<P>__{(detached)}
<D>__{how long are you going to be gone this time?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{gone?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{isn't that what all this is about? the wine, cooking me dinner your next assignment?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you always say that then you leave.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i bet i deserved that. i bet jon archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on earth.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{jon, that's not true }
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{of course it's true, but i'm trying to change? i'm here because i want to be alone with you. i want to see the candle light dance in your beautiful }
<A>__{uh oh. castor can't tell the color of eve's eyes. he leans in "romantically" but we know the real reason.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{ brown eyes.}
<A>__{he smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin. she's aroused, but wary. so castor goes in for the kill.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i wanted it all to be just right... when i told you about my promotion.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{your what?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{well, i don't have it yet. but lazarro's getting old he won't be around forever. and i'm getting the itch to move up.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{jon... that's wonderful.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{so you see, i'm not going anywhere. unless it's upstairs with you...}
