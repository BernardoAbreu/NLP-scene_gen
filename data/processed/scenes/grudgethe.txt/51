<A>__{it's an overcast afternoon. swollen clouds hang low over the house. it looks a bit more imposing than usual. the mailbox is adorned with the japanese equivalent of a "for sale" sign weather worn, and looks like it's been there for years. suzuki (30s, japanese), a real estate agent, waits by the gate. then he notices something. waves, and smiles. it's susan, approaching with matthew, jennifer and emma. susan shakes suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in japanese. she turns to her brother.}
