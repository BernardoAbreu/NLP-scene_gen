<L>__{178. gun deck day}
<A>__{the midshipmen and powder monkeys have assembled for weapons practise, armed with cutlasses. calamy and williamson divide the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school yard football.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{blakeney...}
<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{rye...}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{swift...}
<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{boyle...}
<C>__{calamy}
<P>__{(the final choice)}
<D>__{all right, come on addison.}
<A>__{little addison joins calamy's side, trailing his too large sword. williamson tosses a coin.}
<C>__{calamy }
<D>__{heads.}
<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{it's tails. we attack.}
<A>__{calamy's side retire to a defensive position made of tar barrels at one end of the deck. from here they are suddenly aware of jack idly watching their mock fight from the quarter deck williamson's team give a yell and charge at them. it's serious fighting. heads are struck, fingers are rapped. blakeney, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{ow ow ow!}
<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{yield.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{let go of him.}
<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{yield!!}
<A>__{calamy can't drag the bigger boy off. he whips a pistol out of his belt and fires it at williamson's head. williamson is blasted sideways, clutching his face and yelling in pain. the other boys separate, horrified.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{it's just powder. there wasn't a ball in it, just powder.}
<A>__{he helps blakeney to his feet.}
<C>__{calamy }
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where jack stood, but the captain is no longer watching.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{what's wrong? i saved you.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{i didn't need to be saved.}
