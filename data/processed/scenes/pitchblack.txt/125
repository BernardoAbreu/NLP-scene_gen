<L>__{exterior settlement day}
<A>__{as shazza and audrey repair the sand cat.}
<L>__{exterior skiff day}
<A>__{close on the knife slicing through the vectran. riddick hands the trim to pilgrim #1. camera follows as he scampers onto the skiff...balance beams over wing struts...and delivers the piece to imam, who stitches the fabric like an old berber rug weaver. pilgrim #1 pauses to check on... the setting blue sun. nothing unusual. yet.}
<L>__{interior skiff day}
<A>__{the hatch closes, seals. close on a monitor. a "hull integrity test" is underway. fry scans rising pressure gauges.}
<C>__{riddick }
<D>__{looks like we're a few shy....}
<A>__{fry whirls. riddick is aboard , staring at the depleted battery bay. and he has imam's blade.}
<C>__{riddick }
<D>__{power cells.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{they're coming.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{strange, not doin' a run up on the main drive yet.}
<P>__{(half beat)}
<D>__{strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{i got the quick and ugly version.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{an' now you're worried about a repeat of history?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{entered our minds.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{i asked what you thought.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{you scare me, riddick. that's what you wanna hear, isn't it? there, i admit it, can i get back to work now?}
<A>__{she finds the courage to turn her back on him. riddick moves closer and takes a beat to scan the controls. the cabin pressure builds.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{think johns is an do right man? you think i can trust him to cut me loose?}
<A>__{a beat. does riddick already know? is he testing her?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{why, what'd you hear?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? then again...i am worth twice as much alive.}
<P>__{(reading her face)}
<D>__{didn't know? johns ain't a cop. oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah he's just a merc and i'm just a payday. that's why he won't kill me. the creed is greed.}
<A>__{it knocks her off stride, but...}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{save it, riddick. we aren't gonna turn on each other no matter how hard you try.}
<A>__{riddick moves right up behind her.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{i don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, carolyn but i do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. so you better find out the truth. come nightfall, you better know exactly who's standing behind you.}
<A>__{a monitor chirps the news: "hull integrity 100%." exhaling gasses, the hatch opens automatically.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. and ask why your crew pal had to scream like that 'fore he died.}
