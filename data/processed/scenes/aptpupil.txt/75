<A>__{but archie is too disoriented to move. summoning all his courage, todd pokes the shovel into him, as if to prod him out of the way. but when the blade of the shovel touches him, archie counters violently, grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side. todd holds tightly to the handle, an act which sends him flying across the cellar. the shovel stays with archie, and now he wields it like it were a child's toy. he slashes it viciously through the air. todd hides under the stairs, watching archie duel with the shadows. todd bumps into something. archie hears him. through the slats in the staircase we see archie jabbing the shovel at todd.}
