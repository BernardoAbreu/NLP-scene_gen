<L>__{ext helicopter pad dusk}
<A>__{muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter. two workers carry gennaro on a stretcher. ellie boards with the kids on each side of her, holding her hands. grant and hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{dr. grant, don't abandon this beautiful place. i need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again. and it will be on its feet again.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we have to leave now.}
<A>__{hammond stops.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{oh you don't know. there are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for euro jurassic and jurassic japan.}
<A>__{grant is unimpressed. he holds a hand out to hammond. hammond tries a new approach.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{don't you see i've exalted human potential here? you must see it. you must feel it. i called back a life form. listen, dr. grant, don't go. be a part of this. i'm inviting you to do just that let the others go, if they want.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you interrupted natural law. there are regulations,}
<A>__{rules that nature follows}
<D>__{that make her knowable.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{barriers? like the seasons? the earth spinning, orbiting the sun? the entire solar system in interlocking motion. our own beings in biological step with it all. mr. hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i know what it's done. i've made triceratops and gallimimus and a t rex. i've got a batch of iguanadons being born on tuesday. what do you say to that?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{don't count on it. now get in.}
<A>__{grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to hammond.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus}
<A>__{ement attractions.}
<D>__{you made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i created genetic miracles!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you created a park to generate a profit making merchandising operation.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{the merchandise is just a by product. souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. you fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. alan, look, let's not argue. the problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. they failed me. the park, i promise you, is safe. it really is.}
<A>__{grant grabs hammond's arm, starts to tug.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you park is doomed. now come with me.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it is not! it's blooming! in the throes of labor! you are one more more negative voice in a}
<A>__{universe of negativity.}
<D>__{you'll amount to nothing. you'll be a bone brusher all your life. i pity you.}
<A>__{hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as the rotors start up. hammond's suit whips in the wind. grant calls to him, reaching out his arm.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{come back, mr. hammond! it's over!}
<A>__{hammond keeps walking. he disappears over a grassy knoll. grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when the attack comes. with a huge bellow, the t rex comes charging at the helicopter. the pilot screams for all to board as he starts to lift off. the rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape. the copter angles dangerously as the rex holds on. ellie fires a fire extinguisher into the furious face of the rex and its jaws relax. the copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky. the rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter a final swipe with its tail. the tail swishes through the air and cracks against the plexiglass windshield which fissures and pops. the pilot struggles to maintain altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air. with a roar of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars. away, leaving an angry t rex alone. unnoticed by the frustrated rex, hammond slips away and walks into the jungle. in the copter slowly pan the exhausted faces of muldoon and his workers, lex and timmy holding onto each other, and grant huddles next to ellie. he reaches out and puts an arm around her shoulder. she reaches up and pulls his arm close.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{they're so beautiful. they're condemned, aren't they? even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i have a theory.}
<A>__{ellie looks up in surprise. she give him a big smile.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you have a theory?}
<A>__{grant smiles back at her.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i think that they could never completely isolate the dinosaur dna. there was always some microscopic mosquito contamination. but at the molecular level, that was enough. every dinosaur received the same genetic massage, the encoding that every mosquito gets to terminate life after a season.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{so the very process itself was flawed.}
<A>__{she's sad. grant hugs her. over her shoulder he gives a parting glance to the island. a green jewel in a blue sea. suddenly it is obliterated by clouds. camera pans away and swoops down from the copter. it crosses the sky. the camera descends to isla nublar, slowly reveling in its natural beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle. in the jungle magic hour hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth. he almost reaches the top when he slips. he falls to the soft ground and rolls. he tumbles he lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop, finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water. face down, his head splashes into the puddle. no movement. just the sound of labored breath. camera pans to hammond's hand, half submerged in water. camera moves}
