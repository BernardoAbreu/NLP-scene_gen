<L>__{exterior compound the slope to macready's shack}
<A>__{the winds are thick and vicious now. macready and nauls pull themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. a violent gust sends macready's body horizontal, but still hanging onto the rope. the wind slaps him back down. his flare and torch tumble back toward nauls. nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill. macready, lying vulnerable, watches nauls pull his way toward him. he tenses. nauls reaches him. a beat. he hands back his torch. relieved, macready pulls himself upright.}
