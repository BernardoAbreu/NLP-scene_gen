<A>__{indy and the pirate continue to fight. the cannon fuse sparks. burning toward the bottom. the pirate pushes indy's head inside of the cannon opening. the fuse will blow at any second. at the last moment, indiana overpowers the pirate. indy leaps to the floor. the pirate falls forward. face to face with the cannon opening! boom! the cannon fires! indy's shirt is splattered with blood. indiana runs to a wooden staircase, hurrying up the stairs. to the top deck.}
