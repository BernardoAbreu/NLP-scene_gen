<A>__{there are several horses in their stalls. grace and judith enter, talking, carrying their english saddles. judith stops at a stall, disappearing into it as she says "hello?"..., grace continues to the end stall. pilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hello, beautiful boy.}
<A>__{he's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. she enters, touching his muzzle. he plays with her by nudging her back.}
