<A>__{bobby is zipping down the hallway on his scooter. he takes the corners at high speed, following the spell markings on the floor.}

<D>__{kathy! come on.}
<A>__{as he rounds the next turn too fast, his scooter shoots out from under him, his glasses sail off his head...}

<D>__{aahh! ... and he lands on his ass.}
<A>__{bobby grabs his glasses again, and when he slips them on }
<B>__{through ghost glasses}
<A>__{he sees a decapitated head lying on the floor right between his legs, wrapped in plastic. the head's eyes snap open, and it begins to mouth words. bobby screams... then he hears a dragging sound behind him, like dead skin slapping on glass. bobby turns and sees a headless, legless human torso, wrapped in sheets of filthy plastic, crab walking towards him...}

<D>__{daaddd!!!!}
<A>__{bobby jumps to his feet, turning. he runs down the hall. looks back, sees nothing, then when he turns back, straight into the bound woman. pinned against the glass, the bound woman lets out a muffled cry. strangled by a businessman's tie, which is still cinched tight around her neck, her tongue sticks out like a thick blue thumb. her hair, skin, and prom dress are clotted with dirt and worms the marks of a shallow grave. her hands and feet are bound by rope, but that's not the worst. her head sits askew on her shoulders, neck obviously broken, a chunk of bone jutting out just beneath the skin. panicked, she goes into violent convulsions. it's too much for bobby. he turns and bolts, racing blindly through the basement's glass hallways. when finally he feels safe, he slows enough to look over his shoulder, and that's when he slams into a wall of glass. the collision knocks his glasses from his head, his mike from his shoulder. he reaches for his glasses when the tiny sound of a squeaking wheel issues from his mike down the hall. bobby looks at the mike, then fearfully back at the glasses in his hands. ushering all his courage, bobby dons the glasses, and with his heart beating like a hummingbird's, he turns around, and sees... another woman there, walking down the corridor towards him. dressed in only a hospital gown, she wheels a portable iv stand along the floor. yards of thin plastic iv tubes tether her to the stand. her arms, thin, withered from long illness, bear nasty scars from unnumbered operations. her head is almost completely covered in stained bandages, but a beauty mark decorates that portion of her face we can see. she gropes blindly down the passage, straight towards bobby. he backs up, trips over his feet, almost falls. the iv woman stops. so does bobby. bobby waits, frozen. he tries to call for help, but can only manage a gasp.}

<D>__{dad! dad!}
<A>__{the iv woman seems to respond to the sound of his voice. she cocks her head, as if listening. she moves, calling out, but we hear it through the tiny amplifier of bobby's toy mike.}

<D>__{b bb bobby?}
<A>__{and now he recognizes her voice it's his mother, jean. that's it. bobby turns and runs like hell. around the corner, and right into cyrus. or cyrus's ghost. pale white, with eyes rolled back, and a big spike sticking out of his neck. standing behind a pane of glass. bobby actually hit glass, and he catches a glimpse of the dead cyrus just before he's knocked out from the impact. as his glasses and microphone fall to the floor, we...}
