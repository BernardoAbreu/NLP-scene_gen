<ACTION>__{It's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily sees her, smiles.}

<CHAR>__{EMILY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It'll be okay.}
<ACTION>__{Lucy not so sure. The FOOTSTEPS are upon them. EDWARD SHERIDAN makes his entrance. A menacing man with a gaunt face and dark deep-set eyes. Emily holds out her hand.}

<DIAL>__{Hi, I'm Emily --}
<ACTION>__{Edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. Sits beside Lucy on the sofa. Margaret sits on the other side. Lucy tenses, trapped between them. Emily speaks with kindness and composure. Hostile encounters part of the job.}

<CHAR>__{MARGARET} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.}

Fires a warning shot over their heads. BANG! Deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a thunderclap. But the dogs don't move, just sit there staring. Barron lowers his gun. It's time to get the hell out of here. He backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still trained on the dogs. They watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their back legs twitching in anticipation. Barron quickens his step and that's their cue.

The pit bulls crash skull-first into the concrete, but continue their pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp. He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods, denting the metal. The dogs jump up behind him, relentless in their pursuit. Jaws snapping at his heels, Barron takes to the car roofs, the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him. He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves. They hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh. Stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his throat, Barron doesn't see what's coming. The last car. The edge of the parking garage. He's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. The ground, far below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration. We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on the pavement below, blood pooling around him.
