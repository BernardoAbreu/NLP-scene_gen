<A>__{jay is speeding along in a sportscar. he is pulled over by a police truck.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey chris.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{license and registration please.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you're joking right?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{license and registration.}
<A>__{jay hands it over.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what's the problem sheriff?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you. and the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh. only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction. you took care of that.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yea that's right and i plan on taking care of everything else too.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{if you can, try to think this through. a casino is a license to print money. why would i jeopardise that by selling drugs?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{cause you owned the town jay. it's changed now.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{really? see the only thing that i think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge. but underneath that badge is the same guy that couldn't make it playing college football, apparently couldn't make it in the army and not gonna make it as a cop.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yea, and if you push too hard you're gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 40. license please.}
<A>__{chris hands it over.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{thanks sheriff.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sir get your tail lights fixed, it's your last warning.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what's wrong with my tail lights?}
<A>__{chris smashes up the back end of jay's car with his trusty piece of cedar wood.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{they're broken.}
