<A>__{toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand new pair of indian moccasins) and caroline sing "mood indigo" together. toby holds a complicated looking, black con traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{how's this thing work, anyway?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(not confident)}
<D>__{it makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{and we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, it was everywhere in moab, they say just like gold in the gold rush days.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{but we were too late in moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in salt lake city.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? honey, this could be a big break for us. if this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn nash ambassador no money worries... it'll be like heaven on a june day.}
