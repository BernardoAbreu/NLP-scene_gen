<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{white pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room. no sign of life. cheap decorations. he walks around cautiously. turns lights on. then reconsiders. turns them off again. disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror. angle on open bathroom door the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor. white steps back into the bathroom. he picks up the fish again, doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.}
<B>__{back in the other room}
<A>__{he searches through things. a grey overcoat in the closet. he goes through the pockets, finds a wallet. no i.d., just a laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea side town. angle on a revolver on the bed side table. he picks it up, his grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the trigger and... bang! the gun goes off. a bullet ricochets wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall. startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again. he examines it carefully now. opens the chamber. tight on the gun five bullets left. he turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat. he moves to the bed. a ripped photograph on the rug. a fragment of a woman's face, her left eye. he lifts the fragment up. there's handwriting on the back, part of a note:}
<D>__{...means the most to me. love you forever. e...}
<A>__{the rest is missing. he sits on the edge of the bed. as he does this, he notices something else on the floor. his p.o.v. follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a woman's bare foot behind the bed. he stands abruptly, fumbles across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room. in the shadows he can make out a woman's naked body lying in a pool of blood. her eyes stare lifeless. white stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his mouth.}
