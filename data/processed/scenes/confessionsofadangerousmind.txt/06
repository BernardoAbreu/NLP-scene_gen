<D>__{when you're young, your potential is infinite. you might do anything, really. you might be great. you might be einstein. you might be goethe. then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been. you weren't einstein. you weren't anything. that's a bad moment. but i remembered something carlyle wrote: "... there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed." i realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale. maybe it would help me understand why.}
