<A>__{molly swaggers down a hallway, followed by isabel and giordano. she stops at an observation window and looks through it to see danny, who is handcuffed to a chair, awaiting interrogation. his expression is impassive. she moves on to the next window: yen. same impassive expression. she continues down the line, reuben, livingston, and saul. each has the same impassive expression. through the final window she sees linus... he's nervously tapping his foot. molly smiles sadistically.}
