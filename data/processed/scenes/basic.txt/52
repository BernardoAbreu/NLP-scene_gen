<L>__{interior cabin last night}
<A>__{obviously abandoned. bare of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace. dunbar and nunez shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse into the cabin. dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as nunez helps them up.}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{what happened to you }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{we finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion }
<P>__{(to mueller)}
<D>__{where's pike?}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{we don't know. west is dead.}
<A>__{silence. dunbar and nunez stare at him. mueller jerks a hand towards kendall and childs.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{they found him. poor fucker was practically blown in half }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{poor fucker my ass...}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{you better watch it, faggot, i'm not sure you and childs didn't do him }
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{what about you, wandering around alone? at least we have an alibi }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{what do you mean, alone?}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{pike and i got separated }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{yeah and he doesn't know when }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{i remember now, it was before the explosion }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{oh, you remember now }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{i'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly }
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{what about pike?}
<A>__{mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man. silence. they realize what the question means.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{he wouldn't kill anybody. . .}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. you know how much he hated west }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i hated west, childs hated west, everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesn't mean we killed him!}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{what if it wasn't one of us? what if it was a local }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{he was blown up by a phosphorous grenade, they don't exactly sell those at 7 11.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{look, here are the facts roberto was with dunbar, queen kendall was with childs, and pike's the only one not here. he did it!}
<A>__{the others nod, becoming convinced.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{he is the only one unaccounted for.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{maybe he's dead too. maybe you killed them both, mueller }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(to mueller)}
<D>__{let me see your grenades.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{we were each given three so whoever killed west will be missing one.}
<A>__{mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{see? three. now can we please }
<A>__{he stops. hearing a sound outside. through the wind and rain, footsteps on the porch. they all turn to the door. waiting... the door swings open.. pike. covered in blood.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{hey, guys.}
<A>__{they stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty fireplace. finally:}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{whose blood is that, jay? west's.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{any kindling for afire?}
<A>__{he looks around for kindling. a beat.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{what do you mean, west's?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i mean i killed him.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{isn't that what we all wanted?}
