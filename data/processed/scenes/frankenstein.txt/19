<C>__{victor}
<D>__{as a boy, i stood at this window and watched god destroy our tree.}
<A>__{b.g. screaming stops, victor and elizabeth turn, gazing up the grand staircase. the sudden silence is even more frightening. the faint cry of a newborn infant drifts down a door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. victor's father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward them. he pauses halfway down, unable to continue.}

<D>__{father?}
<A>__{a flash of lightning floods the room, revealing victor's father on the staircase. face haggard. eyes hollow. clothes spattered with blood. hands glistening wetly red.}

<D>__{oh god. the blood.}
<A>__{father sits down shakily on a step. victor and elizabeth race up the stairs and pause before him.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i did everything i could.}
<A>__{victor lets out a sob of anguish. elizabeth begins to cry. father gathers them into his arms.}
