<D>__{...the arena is surrounded by fbi, the stands are only half full, the promoter has taken out a million dollar insurance policy due to cassius clay's membership in the militant and radical black muslims because of death threats. oh, and by the way...sonny liston is here, too.}
<A>__{...sees sonji enter in a sequined mini dress, bouffant hair. she attracts attention and disapproval from herbert. she sits next to ali's parents at ringside amid the large, conservatively dressed muslim contingent. he's angry at her presentation. she looks like a girl singer from a doo wop group. he slips off his robe. ali raises his gloves in muslim prayer. meanwhile: the bell rings.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{meets liston, nails him with a straight right. ali begins baiting him, dancing. liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. ali lets liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and ramp into slo mo...to see liston not see it coming. the muscles of ali's upper body contract and ripple in release after his short right catches liston on the point of his chin. liston drops to the canvas like a stone.}

<D>__{liston is down! scarcely a minute into the first round, i can't believe it!}
<A>__{sonji is up. for some reason, tears of worry stream, absurdly, from her eyes. the image: ali standing over liston, fist cocked, bellowing:}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{get up, sucker! get up and fight! no one gonna believe this!}
<A>__{liston tries to get up, rolls over. his left leg spasms. as the ref finally pushes ali to a neutral corner.}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{it's over; it's over!}
