<D>__{surprise! pa pah!}
<A>__{renton sits down and takes it in silence.}
<D>__{hit the artery by mistake. common enough error, or so the quack tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. still, it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. and i tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets, regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{swanney}
<D>__{and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{swanney}
<D>__{the strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year i will be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{sounds great, swanney.}
<C>__{swanney}
<D>__{yeah.}
