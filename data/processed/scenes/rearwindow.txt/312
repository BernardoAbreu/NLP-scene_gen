<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{a light has gone on in miss lonely hearts' apartment. they look. surprise of surprises, she has returned with a lover hooked. he is much younger then she, and a little more keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him. her actions are coy, and over feminine. she slips away from his hasty embraces and exploratory kisses with the proper flush of confusion and nervous giggle that seems to say, "it's quite a surprise you find me so desirable, but me mustn't do anything improper, you know. after all, we're practically strangers and what would you think of me?" she pours a drink for each of them with gestures over genteel. as she sips her drink and look at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch. he moves toward her, this time more cautiously. an embrace, a long kiss. she puts her drink down on the edge of the chair. it spills over onto the rug. he begins kissing her cheek, her ear, her neck. suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away. slaps him across the face. he moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out, out, out. he flushes with anger and embarrassment, and his mouth twists into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what she is. she screams at him to get out. he leaves, slamming the door behind him. she goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, makes a futile effort to clean it up, and the collapses onto the rug sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body.}
