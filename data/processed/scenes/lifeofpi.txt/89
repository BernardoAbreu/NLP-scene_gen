<L>__{exterior the raft night}
<A>__{a full moon. all around the raft, the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton and beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in multiple directions. pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water. the surface ripples where he touched it, the plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and downward through the water, an ever expanding ring. pi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. he peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. richard parker is nowhere to be seen. the blows stop and pi returns his attention to the light show below. pi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface. suddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton a humpback whale streaks to the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. fifty feet in length, it thrusts itself up into the air. pi barely has time to react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water. the animal slips back into the ocean, creating a wave that sends the raft swirling across the water's surface, submerging for a moment, then bouncing off the side of the lifeboat. pi's neatly stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the side of the raft and into the ocean. the whale disappears into the night, leaving pi open mouthed and shaken.}
