<L>__{exterior maurice "snoopy" miller's house day}
<A>__{red brick, showing its age. karen rings the doorbell and then waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy coat. the door opens to reveal moselle in her green silk robe holding her arms close against the cold.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{moselle miller?}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm looking for maurice.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{you find him, tell him the dog got run over and i'm out of grocery money.}

<D>__{lady looking for maurice.}

<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{that's kenneth, my brother. he's talking on the phone.}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{ask what she want with him?}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{you ask her. maurice's business is none of my business.}
<A>__{sounding tired or bored. she turns from the door and walks into the living room. karen steps inside, pushes the door closed and steps into the foyer.}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{how do i know?}
<A>__{karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and sees kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on the phone...}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{the state, huh. who's fighting?}
<A>__{karen walks into the living room, where moselle sits on the sofa lighting a cigarette.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{you like to sit down?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{i'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{you not with probation, one of those?}
<C>__{karen}

<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{you a lawyer?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no, i'm not. maybe you know him. glenn michaels?}
<A>__{moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{glenn? no, i don't know any glenn.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he said he stayed here last november.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{here? in this house?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he said he stayed with maurice.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{well, he ain't even here that much. i like to know where he goes, but at the same time i don't want to know, you understand?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your dog was killed?}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{got run over by a car.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what did you call it?}
<A>__{moselle looks at the couch, where a mangled frisbee sits.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{was a she, name tuffy.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(nods, then)}
<D>__{where do you think i might find maurice?}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{i don't know the gym, the fights. i know he don't miss the fights. having some tomorrow night at the state theater. he use to take me.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the state theater?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what you want with maurice?}
<A>__{karen turns, sees kenneth standing in the arched entrance from the foyer.}
<C>__{moselle}
<D>__{she looking for a man name of glenn.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{did i ask you? go on out of here. do something with yourself.}
<A>__{he waits until moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away from them through the dining room. karen watches him come toward her now in kind of an easy strut. she indicates the scar over his eye...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're a fighter?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{how you know that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can tell.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i was ...}
<A>__{he moves his head in what might be a feinterior}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{till i got my retina detached two time.}
<A>__{he's standing so close to her, karen has to look up at him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what'd you fight, middleweight?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{light to super middleweight, as my body developed. you go about what, bantam?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{flyweight.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you know your divisions. you like the fights? like the rough stuff? yeah, i bet you do.}
<P>__{(moves closer)}
<D>__{like to get down and tussle a little bit? like me and tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle. i say to her, "you a good dog, tuffy, here's a treat for you." and i give tuffy what every dog love best. you know what that is? a bone.}
<P>__{(real close)}
<D>__{i can give you a bone, too, girl.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not my type.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{don't matter. i let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{bring your own rubbers with you?}
<A>__{her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club. kenneth grins at her...}
<C>__{kennethn }
<D>__{what else you have in there, mace? have a whistle, different kinds of female protection shit?}
<A>__{karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face to face.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i have to go, kenneth.}
<A>__{she gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's like a golf club grip.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{maybe we'll see each other again, okay?}
<A>__{she steps aside and brushes past him. he grabs her left wrist...}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{we gonna tussle first.}
<A>__{karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip. she pulls an arm's length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head, kenneth hunching, ducking away...}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{god damn ...}
<A>__{he lets go of her and karen gets the room she needs, so that when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you wanted to tussle, we tussled.}
<A>__{and she walks out. she sees moselle standing there in the foyer. karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and comes out with a business card.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{i wrote my hotel number on there in case you run into glenn.}
<A>__{moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe. karen smiles at her and walks out the door.}
