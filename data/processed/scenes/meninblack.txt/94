<A>__{as lower manhattan is waking up, jay and kay enter the building.}
<L>__{interior mib building headquarters early morning}
<A>__{despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full blast. the large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the constellation}

<C>__{jay}
<D>__{doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{the twins keep us on alpha centaurian time a 37 hour day. give it a few months you'll get used to it. or you'll have a psychotic episode.}
<A>__{he points up at the screen with a laser pencil.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{here's orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky...}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{and here's orion's belt }
<A>__{he indicates the three stars that make up the belt.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's what the little guy was talking about, "to prevent war, the galaxy's on orion's belt..."}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{there are no galaxies on orion's belt. the belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars.}
<P>__{(switches off the laser pointer)}
<D>__{you heard wrong.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you're attracted to me, aren't you?}
<A>__{jay starts to cross over to another monitor, where kay is sitting alone, tie loosened, slightly disheveled. on the screen, the word "searching" blinks, encouraging patience. the image changes to a satellite view of north america, which quickly zooms in on the southwest. on screen, the satellite view zooms down to arizona, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. the printout changes to "subject acquired." the image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we get a good look at a middle aged woman.}
<D>__{subject: elizabeth ann reston present location: residence 553 fairfield ave. tempe az}
<A>__{whoever elizabeth ann reston is, she's lovely. she's setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by an eye in the sky just as kay is unaware that jay is standing behind him. jay notices the monitor with the middle aged woman on it. he looks at kay's expression, then back at the monitor.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{pretty lady...}
<A>__{kay clicks off the picture of her. jay drags a chair and sits down.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{you were the guy with the flowers in the}
<P>__{photo, (the night the aliens arrived.) (what, you were on your way to a dance or}
<D>__{something and you got lost? and she never got those flowers, did she?]}
<A>__{kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{grumpy guy's story comes into focus. she ever get married?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{it's more than kay can bear. he reaches out and flicks a switch. the monitor goes blank, except for a data screen:}
<C>__{subject lost}
<A>__{kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. jay looks at him: "is this me in thirty years?" a moment goes by. finally:}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have }
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{try it.}
<C>__{zed }
<D>__{kay.}
<A>__{jay and kay cross back toward the lad (landed alien display), where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering light. some lights are starting to go out.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(quietly, with dread)}
<D>__{they're leaving.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{we've had twelve jumps in the last hour. redgick was just the beginning.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what do they know that we don't know?}
<A>__{kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. another light flickers out.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{why do rats desert the ship?}
<P>__{(to the twins)}
<D>__{go to lem sat iv. put up a forty field view of manhattan.}
<A>__{on the screen new york city is just a bright spot of light on the eastern coast of the united states.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{four hundred.}
<A>__{now there's a view of the earth from space. nothing unusual.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{four thousand.}
<A>__{now we're looking at earth from far, far away and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture: a battle cruiser far off to one side of the earth. the words "level four" flash in red letters on one side of the map.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{that's an arquillian battle cruiser.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and we've got a dead arquillian prince.}
<A>__{a communication starts coming over the speakers a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{message coming in.}
<A>__{the communication continues.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{speak of the devil.}
<A>__{the communication continues.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{they sound pissed.}

<P>__{(to kay)}
<D>__{meanwhile get down to rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up.}
<A>__{kay and jay walk away.}
<C>__{zed }
<D>__{and kay take a lot of fire power.}
<A>__{in the equipment locker kay pulls out the enormous, many barreled hand gun. a small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious swirling gases visible through its walls.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i like that.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{series four de atomizer.}
<A>__{kay pulls out another weapon, the tiniest gun we've ever seen.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{here. we call this the "noisy cricket."}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you get a series four de atomizer and i get a "noisy cricket?!"}
<P>__{(looks at the gun)}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm going to break it.}
<A>__{jay follows kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the arquillian battle cruiser hum and whir as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below.}
