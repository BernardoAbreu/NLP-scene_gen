<L>__{exterior nash ambassador day}
<A>__{caroline exits the building, dumps the geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car. she gets in, and says two words:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<L>__{interior nash ambassador day}
<A>__{caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening rer rer rer rer noise from the engine: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.}
<L>__{exterior nash ambassador twenty minutes later}
<A>__{caroline and toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that mechanic in colorado said it needed points.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i know. don't tell me what i already know. this thing's a bottomless pit. i don't know what to do. no matter how much money i pour into it...}
<A>__{suddenly a woman in pedal pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops. she's vaguely low class, but friendly and sympathetic.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'course these days i don't have to worry about that. my husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever i wanna go, i just have to hoof it, you know?}
<A>__{caroline smiles, then her face changes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you don't have a car?}
<P>__{(as the woman shakes her head)}
<D>__{you want this one?}
<A>__{shocked, the woman says }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i... uh... i...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're gonna give our car away?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{seriously. it needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to god, i can't look at it one more minute.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, sure...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{get the bags out. get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. we're rid of this son of a bitch pink and white albatross. you don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hell, no.}
<P>__{(she looks)}
<D>__{there's no dent there...}
<A>__{caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish pan.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, yes there is!}
<A>__{toby hands the woman the owner's slip, caroline gives her the keys.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{... you really just giving me this car?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it's done. it's yours. you got yourself a nash ambassador!}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{both of them pick up two bags apiece all they have in the world and off they go, feeling good.}
