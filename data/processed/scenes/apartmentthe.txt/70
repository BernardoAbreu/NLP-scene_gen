<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{it is exactly the way we left it. there is no sign of fran, except for the gloves she dropped on the coffee table earlier. bud switches on the light, shuts the door.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{say, this is snugsville.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(helping her out of her coat)}
<D>__{mrs. macdougall, i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(a gleam)}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{ask anybody around here. as a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go and i may go just like that }
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{ i have promised my body to the columbia medical center.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(shuddering deliciously)}
<D>__{gee. sort of gives you goose bumps just to think about it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, they haven't got me yet, baby. dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time preliminary wise.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{i'm with you, lover.}
<A>__{she takes the bowl of melted ice bud has handed her, disappears into the kitchen. as bud starts to remove his coat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the phonograph. he crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck in the last groove of a long playing record. bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts it aside and substitutes the cha cha record. as the music starts, he dances over to the coat rack beside the door, hangs up his chesterfield and bowler. he turns back into the room, still dancing, suddenly spots fran's gloves on the coffee table. he picks up the gloves, looks around for some convenient place to get rid of them. moving over to the bedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed inside. he shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a delayed reaction to something he saw inside. he quickly opens the door again, looks. sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is fran. the light from the bathroom falls across her. she is fully dressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep. bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him, walks over to fran.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{all right, miss kubelik get up. it's past checking out time, and the hotel management would appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here.}
<P>__{(fran doesn't stir)}
<D>__{look, miss kubelik, i used to like you i used to like you a lot but it's all over between us so beat it o u t out!}
<P>__{(no reaction; he puts}
<D>__{a hand on her}
<P>__{shoulder, shakes her)}
<D>__{come on wake up!}
<A>__{she doesn't respond. but something falls out of her hand, rolls across the bed. bud picks it up, looks at it it is his sleeping pill vial, now uncapped and empty.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(a hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{for a second he is paralyzed. then he drops the vial, grabs fran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakes her violently.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik! miss kubelik!}
<A>__{fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. bud lets go of her, rushes out. in the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha ing away. bud dashes to the phone, picks it up. then it occurs to him that he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. out of the kitchen comes margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{i broke a nail trying to get the ice tray out. you ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator.}
<A>__{bud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{i didn't mean right now.}
