<L>__{exterior neptune orbit lewis and clark event horizon}
<A>__{the lewis and clark and the event horizon, locked together in neptune orbit. lights shine from the horizon as power is restored. no longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel.}
<L>__{interior event horizon bridge}
<A>__{weir moves from station to station, restoring power to each. starck sits at the communications workstation. miller watches over her shoulder.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{the antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... no one's going to be coming to help us.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how much oh two do we have?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{oxygen is not the problem.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{carbon dioxide?}
<C>__{starck}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it's building up with every breath we take. and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we can take the filters from the clark...}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{i thought of that, with the filters from the clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. after that, we'd better be on our way home.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what about the life readings you picked up?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{the event horizon sensors show the same thing: "bio readings of indeterminate origin." right before that wave hit the clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what's causing the readings?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{i don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{so where is the rest of the crew? we've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. dr. weir? any suggestions?}
<A>__{weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{miller follows weir's gaze to the wall: a rorschach test in blood...}
