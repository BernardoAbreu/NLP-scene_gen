<A>__{it's a tense, edgy group. every movement made is in slow motion, every word is a whisper. they gaze grimly out the windows at the silent, deserted, heat shimmering main street. val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on rhonda's legs. she doesn't even wince.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{you paying attention? this oughta hurt like hell.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{it does.}
<A>__{she smiles at him.}
<C>__{rhonda }

<C>__{val}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{first time for me.}
<A>__{she gazes at him. he looks away. over at the bar, pham holds up a new pair of pants for rhonda.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{oh, thank you.}
<A>__{grateful for something to do, val eases over to get the pants. rhonda looks after him. then she becomes aware of someone staring at her . it's earl, giving her a big cheshire cat grin that says "what did i tell you?" pham hands the pants to val. then pham and miguel reach simultaneously for a sods bottle and knock it over! it rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands try to stop it. no good. it rolls off the end and crash! everyone freezes. sure enough the building shudders. floor boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape along under the floor. people close their eyes, not even breathing. finally the noise subsides. everyone relaxes a little.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{so what are we gonna do, you know? how long till they go away?}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{they got the patience of job. they just sit and goddamn wait til they hear something that sounds like lunch. we need a plan.}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{i've got a plan. you and val take your truck, get to the mountains. hike to bixby. get us some help.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{those scumsuckers are my radials, pham!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, we can take my truck then.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no good. you need major four wheel drive just to get up that jeep trail.}
<A>__{they all shut up when they hear viola's dog yapping in the distance.}
