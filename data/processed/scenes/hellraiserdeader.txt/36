<L>__{exterior the bottom of the stairs day}
<A>__{at the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. a hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door long rendered unreadable by the effects of time. amy inspects the padlock. it's heavy and uncompromising. she tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain but that's only a few inches. amy peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. she looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps to the side and shoves it up. then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp and pulls. the bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose. they slide out with it. she tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open. there is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. amy enters.}
