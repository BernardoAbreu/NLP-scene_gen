<L>__{int nite: don's office (winter 1945)}
<A>__{sonny and tessio are huddled around a yellow pad. they look up, startled.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{don't worry, theresa; they just want to give tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose.}
<A>__{he reassuringly hugs theresa, and then to michael's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how's mom?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{good. she's been through it before. me too. you were too young to know about it. you better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can help you out...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if i let you get mixed up in this.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{jesus christ, he's my father, sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{theresa.}
<A>__{she understands, and leaves them alone.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{all right, mikey...who do we have to hit, clemenza or paulie?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{one of them fingered the old man.}
<A>__{michael didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{clemenza? no, i don't believe it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you're right, kid, clemenza is okay. it was paulie.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how can you be sure?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{on the three days paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. we got people in the phone company.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{thank god it was paulie...we'll need clemenza bad.}
<A>__{michael is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{is it going to be all out war, like last time?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{until the old man tells me different.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then wait, sonny. talk to pop.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sollozzo is a dead man, i don't care what it costs. i don't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york. the tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. i don't care if we all go down together.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{that's not how pop would have played it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i know i'm not the man he was. but i will tell you this and he'll tell you too. when it comes to real action, i can operate as good as anybody short range.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{all right, sonny. all right.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{christ, if i could only contact luca.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{is it like they say? is he that good?}
<A>__{outside, we hear theresa cry out, almost a scream of relief. then open the door and rush out. everyone is standing: in the doorway, tom hagen is wrapped in a tight embrace with his wife.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{if i plead before the supreme court, i will never do better than i did tonight with that turk.}
