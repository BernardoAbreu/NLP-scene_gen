<A>__{needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road. the hospital recedes in the background. a few raccoons gather by the side of the road, watching needy as she walks past. a pickup truck whizzes by with its windows rolled down. "through the trees" blasts from the radio. needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.}
