<ACTION>__{JANUARY 1962. MONTAGE A nice girls' school in a south west London suburb. We see girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962: walking with books on their heads, practising their handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with each other.}
<LOC>__{INT. CLASSROOM. DAY}
<ACTION>__{In one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive, bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who looks five years younger than everyone else in the class, write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY, beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her hand - the only one in the class to do so.}

<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM. DAY}
<ACTION>__{Jenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the wall. Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us. She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on the floor near a cheap record player - they're all classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins, she sings along. Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.}

<DIAL>__{I don't want to hear any French singing. French singing wasn't on the syllabus, last time I looked. Jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her head right next to the Dansette to hear it. Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with the almost inaudible track.}
<LOC>__{INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY}
<DIAL>__{Jenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch. Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle- aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the lunch table.}

<DIAL>__{Jenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving. Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice- looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two 13 year old boys sitting between them wave too, parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's embarrassment and Jenny's fury. The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.}

<LOC>__{EXT. BUS STOP. DAY}
<DIAL>__{The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties, dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus stop. In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the foot of one of the children,further slowing down their painfully slow progress across the road. Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.}

There's a horrible Brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough. Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to be able to make Elgar jokes.}

<DIAL>__{I'm afraid I think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. No,I think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. You showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. And I must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(bitterly)}
<DIAL>__{Is it really so grim, your satisfaction?}
<CHAR>__{HEADMISTRESS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. Although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. Through your own volition.}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.}
<CHAR>__{HEADMISTRESS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, you're not a woman. Beat. Jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. The headmistress is pleased with her final line.}
<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT}

<LOC>__{INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY}
<DIAL>__{Jenny on her own, smoking nervously. Hattie and Tina come in. They obviously haven't seen her since it all happened. They both hug her sympathetically and sit down. Nobody knows what to say.}
<CHAR>__{TINA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sure my uncle knows someone who could kill him. If that would help. Jenny smiles wanly, and briefly.}
<CHAR>__{HATTIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did you want to?}
<CHAR>__{TINA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course we didn't. Why would we stop you? Restaurants, hotels, foreign cities, no exams...}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Bitterly)}
<DIAL>__{Yes. Who'd have thought there'd be a down side to all that? I could tell you all about the imagery in Jane Eyre. But I couldn't see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar. They look at her. This is new information.}
<CHAR>__{HATTIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, if you'd told us that we might have tried to stop you.}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There are a lot of things I didn't tell you. I was dreaming.}
<CHAR>__{TINA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's the thing about our lives, isn't it? It's so easy to fall asleep, when there's nothing to keep you awake. Beat.}

<LOC>__{INT. MISS STUBBS' FLAT. DUSK.}

<DIAL>__{This is lovely. Miss Stubbs makes a face.}

<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{MISS STUBBS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You make it sound as though it's an original. Do you like him? Jenny pauses.}

<DIAL>__{Yes. I do. Still.}
<CHAR>__{MISS STUBBS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Still? Gosh, you sound very old and wise.}

<LOC>__{EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY}
<DIAL>__{Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze: it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her, stops, then walks towards her.}

<DIAL>__{Jenny.}
<ACTION>__{Jenny says nothing.}
<CHAR>__{DAVID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell you that I am going to ask my wife for a divorce.}
<ACTION>__{Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't you understand what you've done?}
<ACTION>__{David looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he thought.}
<CHAR>__{DAVID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can see my behaviour must have been... confusing. But we've never sat down and had a proper chat about it all. About the whys and wherefores. They can wait. The important thing is that you're still my Minnie Mouse, and I love you, and you had fun. You know you had fun.}
<CHAR>__{JENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. I had fun. But I had fun with the wrong person, at all the wrong times. And I can't ever get}
<DIAL_PAR>__{those times back, now.(Beat)}
<DIAL>__{Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every day I wake up and pinch myself. And when I think how close I came...}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a dream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts, leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David stares longingly after them.}
