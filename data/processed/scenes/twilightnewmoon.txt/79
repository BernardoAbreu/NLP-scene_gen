<A>__{she pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.}
<L>__{exterior la push clearing in the forest night}
<A>__{bella parks. climbs out of her truck. the moon eerily illuminates the clearing. forest noises encroach. she hears a rustle amid the trees. spooked, she freezes then sees jacob emerge from the trees. a moment as their eyes meet. then sam uley, paul, embry and jared step into the clearing, as well, half clothed, movements almost synchronized. their expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see bella. paul spins on jacob.}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it's alright, jacob, i will go }

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all you care about is her }

<C>__{jared}
<D>__{too late.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bella, get back!}
<A>__{paul falls forward but halfway to the ground there's a loud ripping noise and paul explodes in silver gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring! bella, horrified, grabs jacob's arm, pulling him }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{run, jacob! }
<A>__{but he yanks away from her, runs directly at the paul wolf }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{jake, no! stop !}
<A>__{jacob dives headfirst into the air with another sharp tearing sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur bursts from jacob's skin he lands on the ground a gigantic russet brown wolf, charging the paul wolf. bella reels as the two wolves crash into each other, snarling and ramming one another. the sound is deafening. their teeth flash at each other's throats. bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods camera follows them, as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness... until they disappear. the horrible sounds of the fight still echo back in the clearing sam starts after them, kicking off his shoes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{take bella to emily's place.}
<A>__{sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet. a long silence...}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{guess the wolf's out of the bag.}
<A>__{off bella, stunned.}
