<A>__{up the hill across from pham van's, the old trailer looks perfectly peaceful. except viola's dog keeps yapping. then we hear panicked viola.}
<C>__{viola }
<D>__{quiet! quiet you hateful thing...!}
<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{shut it up! shut the little bastard up!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{chuck him out the door! like a little hors d'oeuvre.}
<L>__{interior viola's trailer day}
<A>__{we hear a loud whap! the dog's bark simply changes to piercing yelps. it would be funny except the trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though by a pile driver! again and again the unseen creatures slam into the frail structure.}
<C>__{viola }
<D>__{get away! get away! oh god in heaven, help me!}
<A>__{the trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation! it tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill! as the dust clears, all is silent. a huge hole is torn in the trailer's floor. viola's possessions are scattered everywhere.}
