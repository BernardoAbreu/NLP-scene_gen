<A>__{she takes his arm, pats his hand.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{today you are her father.}
<A>__{as creasy lets this sink in, looks out where pinta is warming up. sister anna smiles, heads off to a group of parents. we're left with creasy. confused creasy. but clarity is creeping in. as the sky opens up around him...}
