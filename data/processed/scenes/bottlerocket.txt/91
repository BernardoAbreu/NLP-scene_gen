<L>__{exterior railroad tracks. day}
<A>__{anthony and mr. henry are jogging along railroad tracks in the warehouse district. anthony wears a blue t shirt and shorts. mr. henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and tucked into his sweat top. he's wearing black chuck taylors. they've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty yards or so mr. henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick flurry of punches. an older woman rides a bicycle across the tracks. she's not pretty, but she's got a strong face. pioneer stock.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{look at that woman. she's what? fifty? fifty five? but she hasn't let herself go. i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{so do i.}
<A>__{they watch her ride down the street.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{tell me something. what the hell kind of name is dignan?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i'm not really sure. i think it's irish. or maybe }
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{i guess what i'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what do you mean what kind of person? he's a good person.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{sure, sure. he's a great person, and i'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. but i wonder if the kid has the goods}
<P>__{(taps his temple)}
<D>__{up here.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i don't think you're giving him enough credit. i know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. he gets too excited. but }
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{as far as i can tell he hasn't thought his life through. he'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. but business?}
<P>__{(looks at anthony)}
<D>__{you i can work with. you i could groom. dignan's not going to make it.}
<A>__{anthony stops running. mr. henry stops ahead of him and looks back, jogging in place. pause.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you're wrong about dignan.}
<A>__{mr. henry stops jogging in place.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{and you're wrong if you think, i'd turn my back on a friend.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{mr. henry walks to anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder. anthony knocks it off.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{anthony. i want.to say one thing to you.}
<A>__{mr. henry looks anthony right in the eye.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{congratulations. you passed the test.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{the abe henry double cross test. you just made a perfect score.}
<A>__{anthony has to recover.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that was a test?}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{take a deep breath.}
<A>__{anthony takes a deep breath. mr. henry massages anthony's shoulders. he takes anthony's head in his arms and does a quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. then the other side.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{how does that feel?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it feels good.}
<A>__{anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{did dignan take the test?}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yes, he did.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{how'd he do?}
<A>__{they start jogging again.}
<C>__{mr. henry}
<D>__{well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that sounds like dignan.}
<A>__{they veer away from the tracks, picking up the pace, and head into a field toward mr. henry's warehouse.}
