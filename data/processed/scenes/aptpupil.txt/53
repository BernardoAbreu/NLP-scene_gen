<A>__{title: april 1985 dussander, dressed smartly for a day out of the house, emerges from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the sidewalk, the umbrella under his arm. he stops at an empty bench and sits to wait for the bus. archie sits down next to him. at first dussander doesn't pay attention to him, but archie's behavior tells us that he is keenly aware of dussander's presence. dussander stares out into the street, but archie fidgets about, his eyes roaming, and finally slides a little closer to dussander. dussander looks at him flatly. archie grins. dussander turns away, prepared to dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict. then archie speaks...}

<D>__{damn... cuban high heels. nice ones, too.}
<A>__{the squeal of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in front of dussander. he has become perceptibly more nervous as he waits for the passengers to exit. he climbs up the first step.}
