<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{julia sits, sipping a drink, her face still unreadable.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{frank is standing in the shadows. the victim's body is in the middle of the room. julia enters.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{better. much better. i'd like some clothes. and maybe a cigarette.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{then you tell me ... you explain what happened to you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{of course.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{we pan across the walls as frank speaks.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i wanted access to experiences ... pleasures ... that only they could offer ...}
<C>__{julia }
<D>__{the cenobites.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's what they call themselves. they're not human. maybe they were once, but they're not now. they rearrange their own flesh for pleasure.}
<A>__{we've moved across to frank now. he is dressed, in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which his blood is seeping. he smokes, taking great pleasure in the experience.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{and the box?}
<A>__{frank picks up the box. vague, tantalizing forms move over the surface, like ghosts.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it cost me a fortune. all i had. it's a puzzle you see. you solve it, and the cenobites come through ...}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{where from?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{god knows. sometimes i think they're just behind the walls ...}
<A>__{he turns the box over. the lacquer catches the light.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{so they cheated you}
<A>__{in the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving. it's difficult to be sure what the forms signify. is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh no. they kept to their bargain. they gave me experiences i'd never forget ...}
<A>__{the images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are appalling. flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but their pleasure was my pain.}
<A>__{his voice has begun to tremble. the images in the box are more horrific by the moment. and flowing between them, highly distorted, the cenobite's faces, and that of frank, screaming and screaming.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{terrible pain. appalling ...}
<A>__{he can't speak for a moment. after a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy.}
<D>__{my body was forfeit. but my spirit ... they left that here. in the boards. in the walls. watching the world, but never able to touch it ...}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{and the blood let you out?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there are ways to resurrection. blood's one of them. i won't let them take me back, julia.}
<A>__{julia looks at the horrors in the box, and understands his desire.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i want to be whole, and then get out }
<A>__{he lifts the box up.}
<D>__{i won't let them take me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{you won't have to. we'll be gone. somewhere they'll never find us.}
<A>__{there's a rumble of thunder.}
<D>__{not in the whole wide world.}
