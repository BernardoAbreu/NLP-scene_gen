<L>__{exterior quai montebello late afternoon (traveling)}
<A>__{reggie and dyle walking along the quai, next to the seine,}
<B>__{camera leading.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{who do you think did it gideon?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{or tex?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{you're a big help. can i have one of those?}
<A>__{they have passed an ice cream wagon on the corner of the pont au double. dyle shrugs.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(to the vendor)}
<D>__{vanille chocolat.}
<A>__{during the following, the vendor makes a double decker cone and hands it to reggie. dyle pays and they resume their walk all with no break in the dialogue.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i think tex did it.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{because i really suspect gideon and it is always the person you don't suspect.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{do women think it's feminine to be so illogical or can't they help it?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{what's so illogical about that?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{a) it's always the person you don't suspect; b) that means you think it's tex because you really suspect gideon; therefore c) if you think it's tex, it has to be someone else gideon.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh. i guess they just can't help it.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{women. you know, i can't help feeling rather sorry for scobie.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{what like scobie?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no gene kelly. remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'american in paris' without a care in the world? this is good, want some?}
<A>__{she offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice cream. it lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket.}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{i'd love some, thanks.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. reggie still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it. seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{no sense messing up the streets.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{alex }
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm not going to hit you.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no, about scobie, i mean. i can't think of any reason why he was killed.}
<A>__{they resume walking.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many }
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{what makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? he wants it all, alex that means we're in his way, too.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{first your brother, then charles, now scobie we've got to do something! any minute now we could be assassinated! would you do anything like that?}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{what? assassinate somebody?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no }
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{including the cathedral of notre dame in the background.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{ swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love like charles laughton in 'the hunchback of notre dame'?}
