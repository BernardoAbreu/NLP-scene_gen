<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{hey, nobody enters the command center without a power coin!}
<A>__{there's a bleet, bleet emergency lights start flashing near the entrance. alpha watches, forlorn, as ooze seeps through the hairline cracks in the door.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{well... almost nobody.}
<A>__{the ooze slithers and gurgles across the floor, once again ivan rises up. he takes in the state of the art surroundings.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{gee... pretty fancy shmancy. i guess if you invest your money well over sixty centuries you can buy something pretty nice.}
<A>__{alpha drops into a karate stance, makes some bruce lee noises then lunges.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{hi , yah !}
<A>__{ivan holds his arm out, zaps alpha with an electrical charge alpha starts spinning.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{welcome to wiener world. may i take your order, please?}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{you haven't changed, ooze. you're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.}
<A>__{ivan slowly circles zordan's column of light, zordon turns with him.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{put a cork in it "z" . ten minutes out of the egg and i'm already listening to one of your lectures.}
<P>__{(he explodes furiously)}
<D>__{you robbed me of my prime! i was the supreme ruler of the most foul empire in the universe. i was the king of calamity. the duke of destruction. the big man on campus!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then you came along. you locked me into your stuffy little hyperlock chamber and tossed me into the depths like yesterdays trash!}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{it worked for six thousand years.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{don't remind me!}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years? it's boring! not to mention i've had a charlie horse since the renaissance! but now the tables are turned. now...}
<A>__{ivan raises his hands he is holding a flute and he plays a few}
<B>__{notes}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{... it's time to pay the piper!}
<A>__{he uses the flute like a lightning rod a bolt of lightning}
<B>__{blasts a panel to smithereens.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{oh, the things that i have missed. the black plague!}
<A>__{he blows up another panel.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{the spanish inquisition!}
<P>__{(another bolt)}
<D>__{the 70's!}
<A>__{he blows up another panel. ivan casts another lightning bolt,}

<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{and now, finally, i have the strength to destroy your pathetic powers forever!!}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{you won't get away with this!}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{i've got a news flash for you light bright i already have!}
<A>__{now ivan begins to throw lightning everywhere, laying}
<B>__{the command center to waste.}
<A>__{ivan laughs in the b.g. as alpha continues to spin, moving his arms in and out.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{you put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about. you do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around...}
