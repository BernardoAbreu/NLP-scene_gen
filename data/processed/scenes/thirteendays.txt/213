<D>__{and i'm prepared to present the evidence in this room, proving that the soviet union has lied to the world.}
<A>__{and zorin cracks. he looks uneasily to his delegation. they bend forward to consult. adlai sits back in his chair, draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows he's kicked ass. adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his answer, managing not to smile. the diplomatic world is scandalized. at last zorin regroups, lifts his head from his huddle.}

<A>__{the room explodes in laughter. not just nervous any more, not just polite. they're laughing at zorin's parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face. zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed. and he looks like the biggest fool in the world. adlai stares at the beet faced man with disdain. at last, adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him. the photo interpreters come racing in with their briefing boards.}
