<A>__{a lot more space than my green haven. dark paneling and somewhat more tasteful religious art.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{back in a moment.}
<A>__{nick watches her bound up the stairs. he wanders into the musty living area. moves down the mantel examining the trinkets. stops to regard the reproduction of massaccio's expulsion of adam and eve from eden on the wall. he scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of adam and eve.}
<C>__{mr. saunders }
<D>__{i understand you have invited my daughter to the beach.}
<A>__{nick spins around to see mr. saunders reclining in his armchair. he is an immense, florid faced, verdant eye browed ogre in a rumpled blue suit.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{er, yes, mr. saunders.}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{aha! then i trust, sir, you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis, i.e. to provide for the safety and well being of aforementioned minor female.}
<C>__{sheeni }
<D>__{oh, father, do shut up.}
<A>__{sheeni descends the stairs. jean cut offs over a knockout yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility. mr. saunders grumbles. sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and pushes nick out the door.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{let's go, nick. bye, father.}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{vaya con dios!}
