<A>__{sam is leaving the ministry of information retrieval. the lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street lamps are lit. he is exhausted and depressed and anxious about the safety and whereabouts of jill. he begins to retrace their first journey together, down the ministry front steps and around the corner to where jill's truck was parked.}

<A>__{corner night 117a sam stands in the passageway where jill's lorry was first parked. the only hint of its once upon a time presence is a small splodge of oil by the kerb. sam stands lost and beaten under a street light. he slumps down to the pavement unsure his next move. the street light is reflected in the pool of oil. as he stares at the reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue cloud filled sky. sam turns to look at the actual street light. it has become a crack of blazing light coming thru the inner wall of the great stone ship.}
