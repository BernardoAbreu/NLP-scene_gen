<D>__{i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{i told you, leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...}

<A>__{he runs out.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{i will trust you on this, bud, but i'm a little nervous about oveur's record.}
