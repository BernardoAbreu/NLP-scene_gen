<A>__{mini sits in a chair as martin paces.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what the hell was i thinking, letting you talk me into this?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it's probably just routine stuff.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that was not routine, my dear.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{nice use of the word "us", by the way.}
<C>__{martin}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{chill?! believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. you do understand they could go for the death penalty?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{he's probably just trying to spook us.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hello?! they don't try and spook you unless they think you did it!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{well, if it was such a great plan, why am i cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide?}
