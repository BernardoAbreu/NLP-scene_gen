<T>__{then we cut to:}
<A>__{nic sitting back down at the table. she looks drained. nobody notices. the sound drops out. nic's pov: paul and jules talking comfortably. joni and laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family.}
<T>__{reverse onto nic:}
<A>__{totally disconnected. shell shocked. she wants to scream but it feels like she's trapped in cement. things slow way down...}
<L>__{interior nic and jules' bathroom that night}
<A>__{nic and jules perform their nightly ablutions. jules is sonic caring her teeth.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(through the sonic buzz)}
<D>__{well, you and paul seemed to get on like gang busters...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{you're sleeping with him, aren't you.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{nic turns to her, eyes red with anger.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{just be honest with me. don't make me feel crazier than i feel right now!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{where is this coming from?!}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i found your hair in his drain!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(scrambling)}
<D>__{what? i was working. i got dirty so i took a shower.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{oh yeah? you take a nap, too?}
<A>__{jules pauses a second too long. the jig is up.}
