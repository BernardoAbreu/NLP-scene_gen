<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{a speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line on the curves.}
<L>__{interior speeding car night}
<A>__{joe's driving, darnell's holding on. suddenly we hear sirens. joe sees flashing lights in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh shit...}
<L>__{interior coach winters' house late night}
<A>__{winters is asleep. the phone rings. he picks it up.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what is it now?... oh jesus...}
<L>__{interior coach winters' stadium office day}
<A>__{joe sits across the desk from winters, just the two of them.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{the guy went for me first. what was i supposed to do?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{doesn't make any difference. it made the papers, all the wire services. the guy had to go to the hospital. worst of all they got you on drunk driving. you had a blood alcohol level .50 above the legal limit. we can't smooth that over, joe. it'd look like we were sprayin' pledge on bird shit. we had to agree to send you to rehab.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{rehab? i will be a god damn joke. you can't do this to me.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{it was the only way we could get them to drop the assault and d.w.i. you go to trial on those, we lose you for a year, and risk ncaa investigation. c'mon, lotsa athletes have been through rehab.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not in the middle of the season. not in the middle of a heisman campaign.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you'll only miss four games. you'll be back in time for the last one, georgia tech, and a bowl if we get there. plus, you've still got your senior year.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeh, but what will i come back as? what kinda player?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{don't worry, you'll still be the man. you'll still be the leader of this team.}
<A>__{joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up to leave.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry, coach.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{these things happen.}
<A>__{joe walks on out, winters watches him go, then slams the desk in anger. drained, he sinks back in his chair.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{fuckin' kids.}
