<L>__{74. interior willie's suite}
<A>__{in a tight close up: willie screams again. she's lying in bed looking down at something moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous looking insect crawls onto her stomach and willie stops breather. immo bilized by fear, willie watches in silent agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck. across the suite, the doors burst open and indiana rushes in. shorty is behind him, carrying indy's whip. indiana leaps on a stools and slides up to the bed to save willie then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to have some fun.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{this a cheap trick to get me over here?}
<A>__{willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{no don't you see crawling }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what the bug?}
<A>__{willie is petrified and shaking.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{get the bug off!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{gee, i wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!}
<C>__{short round}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{uh uh me neither!}
<A>__{willie looks at the man of action like he's insane. then she feels the bug crawling onto her cheek }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh no oh no!!}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(studying the bug)}
<D>__{you know, willie, i will bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{please oh please, i'm going to die! get it off!}
<A>__{indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug off her face. he and short round watch the insect skid across the floor and suddenly disappear as if by magic! puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving willie behind, bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what did i do to deserve this trip?!}
<A>__{kneeling by the wall, short round examines the baseboard }
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{it went under. hey, i feel wind, indy.}
<A>__{indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound. he moves back and looks at the whole wall. behind him, willie moves past }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm packing! i'm getting out of here right now tonight!}
<A>__{she dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed. meanwhile indy feels the marble walls. he moves to a niche in which there is a small statue of ganesha, the friendly elephant god. indiana lifts the statue and a panel in the wall opens slow ly. short round looks amazed. indy watches the light fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly. indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting. spiderly san skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince bowing before a god.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(he reads aloud an inscription}
<D>__{in sanskrit).}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{what does it mean, indy?}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{"follow in the footsteps of shiva. do not betray his truth."}
<A>__{indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in mayapore, the similarities are striking. it is also a picture of shiva sankara.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(he repeats aloud the inscrip tion also written on the cloth)}
<A>__{over behind the screen, willie's getting into some silk pants with an indian style brocade bodice top }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i don't care if i have to walk to delhi, i'm hey!}
<A>__{she notices indy and short round bending to enter the dark tunnel behind the wall.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{wait a minute! what're you where're you going?!}
<A>__{indy pokes his head back into the room }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{lock your door and don't leave until we get back.}
<A>__{he disappears behind the wall and willie looks worried.}
