<L>__{interior the school building night}
<A>__{a fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows and falls dully across shapes old, shapes forgotten, and one shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor. it's simon; breath a rasp, blood soaked pants leaving a long smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail. he coughs, drags an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses, and looks up at a pair of black, lizard skin boots.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{hi, simon.}
<A>__{simon rolls on his back and sighs.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{gabriel.}
<A>__{simon looks up at puss faced jerry, leaning quietly in a dark corner.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{don't mind me. just along for the ride.}
<A>__{gabriel sits down against the wall.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{so, what shall we talk about? theology?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm a little talked out on theology.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{fair enough...}
<A>__{gabriel turns his boot to the moon, watches the pale light glint back off the lizard scales.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you know why i'm here.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{don't happen to have it on you by chance?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that would have been too easy.}
<A>__{simon suddenly jumps to his feet. tries to escape. jerry trips him, sprawling simon back to the floor.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{please, simon. get serious.}
<A>__{gabriel walks over to him. puts his face close.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{now. where's the soul?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know. so high. used to reside in the recently departed general hawthorne.}
<A>__{simon doesn't answer. gabriel shrugs.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{have it your way, big guy.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i do have one question.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{shoot.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{do you even remember what this war's about?}
<A>__{gabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. then he smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's hardly the point, is it?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i guess i never did get the pointerior}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{happens.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how do you do it, gabriel? how do you go on and on in this place?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i like it here, simon. i always have.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm so tired...}
<A>__{gabriel grasps simon's hand.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{then join us, simon. reject the nicene council. we were here first.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i can't do it, gabriel. i don't even know why anymore, but i can't.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you know the routine.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(swallows hard)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{gabriel's hand is suddenly on simon's face, fingers spread, claw like. they press into the flesh. hard. and harder. until simon starts to bleed. then to burn.}
