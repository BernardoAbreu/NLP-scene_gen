<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{fall from grace}
<A>__{john exits grace towers, walks past a limo toward lexington avenue. rounding the corner, he sees his blue sedan. he looks at the cash, repockets it. he continues slowly, each step a separate task. letour reaches for the door handle. a scream pierces traffic noise. a car screeches, another. voices call out. letour steps back, listens. he retraces his steps, turns onto lexington avenue. the security guard, walkie talkie in hand, clusters on the sidewalk with the limo driver, two pedestrians. a cabbie jumps from his taxi, joins the confusion ("my god!"). a siren approaches. john's beeper goes off. drawing closer, letour sees the partial bloodied shape of a broken body on the sidewalk: he recognizes marianne's skirt. a squad car brakes with a screech. two cops converge, climb over trash, clear the crime scene:}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{get back!}
<C>__{male cop}
<D>__{who saw it? what happened?}
<P>__{(the female cop bends over marianne's body)}
<D>__{ems is on the way.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{too late }
<A>__{a second squad car pulls up. john turns away, walks around the corner. letour opens the car door, closes it, sits inside. a wailing ambulance flashes past, speeds up central park west. letour doesn't react. beeper re beeps; he disconnects the battery. the driver, carlos, twenty five, hispanic, shirt starched, turns, looks, thinks, says:}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{where to?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{where to, sir? where are we going?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{nowhere just now. wait.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{you want me to wait here?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{pause. more police cars. the ems siren starts up; the ambulance speeds downtown past letour's sedan. no reaction. carlos turns off the engine.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{downtown.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{carlos starts the car, pulls into traffic.}
