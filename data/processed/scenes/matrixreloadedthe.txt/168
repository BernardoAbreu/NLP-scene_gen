<L>__{interior penthouse apartment (matrix) night}
<A>__{the apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. gregory sits on a leather couch, watching whatever on the tube with the sound off. he absentmindedly manipulates a quarter over and around his fingers. finally, he stops and looks at the quarter. holding it between his thumb and forefinger, he folds it in half as though it was a disk of bubble gum. he folds it again, then rools it as though its a musket ball. chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. she reaches points the remote at the tv, but gregory puts his hand over it to get her attention.}

<D>__{so, you really dont have any idea how you got here?}

<C>__{gregory}
<A>__{"yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. do you know how we}
<D>__{got this place?" she looks at him, annoyed.}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{duh. we broke in. we dont own a penthouse.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{what if i said we did?}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{id say youre insane.}
<A>__{she finally gets the remote and changes the channel. the volume comes on, louder and infinitely more tinny and obnoxious than anything in life. chandra laughs at the images as gregory stares into space.}
