Kitchen area Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. A few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it. Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out; steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and falls on his ass. Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk, somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the... Lobby He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery. Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him. Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a herky-jerky rhythm. He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and avoids being seen by Black Suit 3. By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like invisibility.
