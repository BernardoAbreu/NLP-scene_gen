<L>__{interior sun up saloon day}
<A>__{the place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. a group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. at the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors. the bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of george clews who, with his brother, bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him. he is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain. he downs his drink, and speaks his thought to bob.}
<C>__{george clews}
<D>__{i'm gonna get his ears.}
<A>__{suddenly old dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{hi you, george clews }
<A>__{george clews turns.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart.}
<A>__{george clews frowns. his eye catches sight of a king size glass of beer being slid across the bar to shorty davis, standing alongside him. that quick, clews beats shorty to the glass and hurls it at dave, who ducks out. cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches clews and shorty.}
<C>__{shorty}
<P>__{(taps clews)}
<D>__{that was my beer, you know.}
<C>__{george clews}
<P>__{(nastily)}
<D>__{if he comes in again i will throw you.}
<A>__{before shorty can reply, clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off. the crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except cap, who holds his shotgun in sight.}
<C>__{cap}
<P>__{(to the clews)}
<D>__{that does it, boys you know where the door is.}
<C>__{george clews}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{com mon i will get his ears.}
<C>__{cap}
<D>__{not until i get my money }
<A>__{george and bob clews are now a few steps from the bar. they have turned as cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.}
<C>__{cap}
<D>__{there's three drinks and a broken beer glass.}
<C>__{george clews}
<P>__{(to bob, after a second's deliberation)}
<D>__{pay 'im.}
<A>__{george turns and starts for the doors as bob comes back to the bar to settle up.}
<C>__{george clews}
<D>__{i will get his ears.}
<A>__{on pap fossler and the others at window as george clews}
<B>__{bursts out through the doors}
<C>__{pap}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{that rocklin'll kill him for sure.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{le's hope.}
