<A>__{agent smith stares, his face twisted with hate. he will never be free of the matrix. he starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring }

<A>__{as the old man stares. trinity hangs up the phone. she turns to neo, standing close enough to kiss him.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{morpheus is right, you know. it doesn't matter what he believes or even what the oracle believes. what matters is what you believe.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i believe...}
<A>__{he stares at the fullness of her lips.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i want to kiss you.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i want to kiss you too...}
<A>__{the phone begins to ring.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{but i want it to be real.}
<A>__{she pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches neo's eye and he looks to where the old man had been. she hears him scream and sees agent smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal. the gun fires, the bullet flying at her, bursting through the plastic window just as trinity disappears. the handset hanging in the air as the bullet hits, shattering the ear piece.}
