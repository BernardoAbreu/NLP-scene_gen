<L>__{interior mombassa bar day}
<A>__{roland tembo, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an african cafe bar in mombassa. it's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals, but there are a few obnoxious tourists too, americans on safari who somehow found the local handout. they're a noisy bunch, but roland tunes them out, calmly eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book, eyeglasses hanging low on his nose. roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow. he looks up. he sniffs the air once, then smiles and calls out a person's name.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{ajay?}
<A>__{he turns around. ajay (ah jay) sidhu, a wiry east indian in his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to sneak up.}
<C>__{ajay}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{roland}
<P>__{(taps his nose)}
<D>__{that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas, you actually wear it. i'm touched. sit down, sit down, what brings you to mombassa?}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{you. tell me, roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{last time i plugged it in, i suppose. why?}
<A>__{behind them, the group of tourists, all men, laughs loudly. one of them, the most obnoxious tourists, berates the waitress.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{i got a call from a gentleman who's going to costa rica, or thereabouts. if he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition. and very well funded.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{well, i'm a very well funded old son of a bitch. you go.}
<A>__{the most obnoxious tourist bellows for the waitress. his buddies laughs. roland throws a glance, annoyed.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{but alone? we always had great success together, you and i.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{just a little bit too much, i think.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{a true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins. if it escapes. but there weren't enough escapes from you and me, ajay. i've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death. maybe i just feel too close to it my }
<A>__{the waitress comes to the tourists' table and the most obnoxious tourist actually paws her ass. roland is out of his chair in a second.}
<C>__{roland }
<P>__{(to ajay)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{romand walks over to the tourists' table, says something to the waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind him. he stares down at the most obnoxious tourist.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{you, sir are no gentleman.}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{is that supposed to be an insult?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{i can think of none greater.}
<A>__{the tourist looks at his buddies and laughs.}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{buzz off, you silly old bastard.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{what do i have to do to pick a fight with you, bring your mother into it?}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{are you kidding? i could take you with one arm tied down.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{in the middle of the floor, the waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the back of his pants with a napkin. he pulls the knot tight and the man turns around. it's roland, with his arm tied down. the tourist stands across from him.}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{i mean my arm.}
<A>__{pow! roland punches him square in the jaw. the tourist reels, stunned. enraged, he lunges at roland, swinging with both arms. roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the tourist to turn around, and pops him thrice in the face. the tourist spins and goes down to the floor, face first. a cloud of sawdust and a loud cheer from the locals rise up in the bar. back at his table, roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with ajay. in the background, the tourist's buddies hurriedly carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{sorry. we were saying?}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{you broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom. tell the truth, roland. aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{ajay. go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.}
<A>__{ajay just smiles.}
