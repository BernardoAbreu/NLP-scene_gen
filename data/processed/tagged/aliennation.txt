<A>__{a long lens shot of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground maybe two or three miles away. the heat waves and the light refraction off the desert scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct. the video camera recording this scene zooms back, then pans over revealing a semicircle of us army vehicles and personnel. army engineers with their tripod mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry. everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon. waiting. the video camera movements are handheld, unsteady, as it moves through the line of army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the army. locals from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, budweiser and fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object. the video camera image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local tv van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else. abruptly the video image contracts, becoming a box chromakeyed behind cnn reporter duncan crais.}

<C>__{crais}

<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{the two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked cars across the street from the mini mart. through the store window they see the old alien proprietor behind the counter. his eyes go wide as kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump shotgun and aims it right at him. the raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door. sykes and tuggle react to the firepower inside.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you got your vest?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{of course. right in the trunk of the car.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, that's comforting. mine, too.}
<A>__{through the store window the robbery continues in pantomime. kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun, yelling orders in the alien language. the proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register. the proprietor's wife, a middle aged alien woman, stands in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear. the raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired. sykes and tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance.}

<D>__{watch the driver. i'm going for a better angle on the door.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i got him. don't get pinned.}
<A>__{tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater corner across the intersection. through the store window sykes sees kipling grab the bag of cash, shove it in his coat pocket. bills fall out, but he doesn't care. then, without warning, kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the proprietor's chest! the proprietor slams back against the shelves, slides to the floor. kipling leans over the counter and fires another round into the proprietor.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{aw, shit.}
<A>__{tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the shots. the human driver of the getaway car (parked at the curb a few doors down from the mini mart) glances up, spots tuggle. he leans on the horn, reaches for a machine pistol on the seat next to him.}

<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{tuggle dives behind a lamp post. the driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine pistol to fire at tuggle. sykes sees this and opens fire at the driver. the driver turns and fires at sykes. sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is sprayed with bullets. a forty foot moving van pulls down the street between sykes and the driver. once the truck is past, sykes is standing behind the bullet riddled car, gun ready. he rapid fires creaming the human driver. tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from kipling and raincoat alien.}

<D>__{i can't! do you mind!}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i will cover you! get outta there!!}
<A>__{sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway car, firing toward the store as he goes. kipling and raincoat dodge behind cover. tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp post and runs to the stalled civilian car. he slides across the hood and drops behind the car for cover. tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car window. his gaze is met by the face of the old man driver who is still inside the car.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{can i get out now?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{move it!}
<A>__{sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in the store. as he considers his next move tuggle fires at the two aliens. they return fire and he slides down to safety behind the car. or so he thinks. glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by the shotgun blasts. he flinches as another blast hits the car. he looks over. there's a big exit hole in the fender beside him. the shot went right through the car. another exit hole is blasted, inches from his shoulder. panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car blasts and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of the car. he has nowhere left to go and a blast comes through the car and catches him squarely in the chest throwing him back onto the street. sykes' head jerks around in time to see his partner of nine years blown away. kipling keeps firing in tuggle's direction until his shotgun clicks empty.}
<L>__{interior mini mart night}

<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{aw shit, tug, jesus! goddamn it!}
<A>__{he stares, shocked and incredulous. he can't find a way to think or feel about this. then we see him going crazy right before our eyes, the rage revving. he takes off toward the store as sirens are heard rapidly approaching in background.}
<L>__{interior mini mart night}
<A>__{sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken glass, bangs through the exit.}
<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round the corner at the far end of the alley. he takes off, quickly cranking up to full speed.}
<L>__{exterior back street night}
<A>__{sykes rounds the corner. doesn't see them anymore. he slows... moves along this street with some caution. lots of shadows, lots of hiding places. sykes hears a noise, looks up... just in time to see raincoat on a high, huge billboard. he cuts loose with the shotgun. sykes dives. huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night. sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the crates. raincoat's shotgun clicks empty now. he drops it, swings down off the fire escape, runs off. sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.}
<L>__{exterior tunnel street night}
<A>__{sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street. the only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up ahead. sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.}
<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{the murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth. he tries to control his breathing so he can hear. the only sound is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt. then he hears another set of footsteps. rapid footsteps, coming toward him, echoing. he can't tell from which direction! he spins, just as a large shape lunges for him with an alien cry. it's the wired raincoat alien. sykes gets his gun up just in time and fires once, twice, three times. raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts. sykes approaches the body slowly. with an inhuman roar, the alien snaps forward, lunging at sykes with outstretched arms. sykes jumps back, startled, and fires twice more at the pale figure. raincoat goes down and stays down. sykes relaxes for the briefest moment. then he hears it... a distinctive clicking sound, metal on metal. sykes looks up and kipling drops down on him from directly above! sykes goes down in a heap. he's managed to hold onto the gun and as kipling comes for him, he swings the gun hand around. kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming the gun from sykes' hand. sykes tries to get to his feet, but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel. a siren is heard approaching in background. kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace. as he draws near, sykes hears that distinctive clicking sound again. sykes' p.o.v. though his vision is blurred, sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist. the strands of this bracelet are what make the clinking noise.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching siren suddenly wails louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way. kipling sees this and leaves sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.}
<B>__{on sykes}
<A>__{dazed, struggling to rise. we hear running footsteps approaching. sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused. sykes' p.o.v. an out of focus alien face looming over him.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien face. the alien, caught by surprise and off balance, sprawls backward out of frame. sykes is grabbed by a human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.}

<D>__{whoa, whoa... hold it. take it easy.}
<P>__{(to alien on the ground)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus. he looks at the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet away. the alien is a uniformed cop... his name is jetson.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i am all right.}
<A>__{he gets up. a trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.}
<C>__{human cop}
<D>__{i better call in.}
<A>__{he moves off. jetson moves toward sykes and the raincoat alien's body. sykes tenses, thinking jetson might retaliate in some way. but jetson simply steps past him to kneel beside the dead alien. he checks for a pulse on the underside of the dead alien's upper arm. nothing. sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain. he struggles to rise. jetson gets an arm around him to help him up.}

<A>__{the pilot does. sykes comes up out of the water. his feet are just clear of the surface when harcourt's hand and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing sykes' ankle. sykes looks down in horror. the helicopter keeps moving up, and before harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm tears away from the torso at the shoulder. sykes wildly shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it falls back into the water below. jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it moves off toward shore.}
<L>__{interior helicopter night}
<A>__{sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his limp arm. jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket, wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain. the pilot stare down at the circle of water where they just pulled sykes from.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{what the hell was that down there? it was weird.}
<A>__{jetson looks at sykes, wondering if he will say. sykes looks at jetson a long moment, then }
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{looked like every other damn slag to me. just plain ugly.}
<A>__{despite the pain, jetson smiles.}

<L>__{interior church anteroom day}
<A>__{we are close on sykes, who is having a hell of a time, trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling. a pair of alien arms reach into frame to help him. one of the alien arms is also in a sling. angle widens to reveal the alien is jetson. both men wear tuxedos.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{how do i look?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{you look very good.}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. sykes opens it. there stands sykes' daughter, kristin, twenty years old, looking radiant in her wedding dress. she is in a foyer, and behind her is the interior of the church with all the assembled guests, including mrs. jetson & son.}
<C>__{kristin}
<D>__{ready, daddy...?}
<A>__{sykes' heart melts. before moving to the door:}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{george, uh... i want to apologize now, in advance, for all the rotten things i will ever say or do to you over the years.}

<D>__{that is all right, matthew. after all, you are only human.}
<A>__{sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.}
