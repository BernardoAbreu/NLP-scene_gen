<L>__{interior abandoned prison cafeteria the next morning}
<A>__{it is a huge, empty room. ramirez sits at the lone table as amos enters. ramirez is eating a bowl of porridge. his breath steams out in the cold. the room is freezing but instead of a warm jacket, he wears light prison overalls.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{good morning. how's the porridge, you like it?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{'morning. it's not bad.}
<A>__{he finishes what's left in the bowl. amos reaches over to a side warming table. there is a huge pot of porridge there.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{good... finish everything in the pot.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{there's got to be like... eight helpings in there maybe...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{no questions... just do.}
<A>__{from now on, unless otherwise indicated ramirez is in the too tight shirt and tie and light jacket. jack is in the distance, observing.}
