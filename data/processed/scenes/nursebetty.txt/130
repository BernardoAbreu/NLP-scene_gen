<A>__{wesley gathering his gear through the open door. charlie stands looking at himself in the mirror. touches at the gray in his hair. as an afterthought, he tosses on a splash of cologne.}
<L>__{interior soundstage day}
<A>__{george leads betty past several standing sets and into the 'operating room' as crew members buzz around. betty walks with her eyes closed and holding george's hand.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{just a little further... come on...}
<A>__{george stops and puts both hands over betty's eyes. he looks about expectantly and then uncovers them with a flourish.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{surprise!}
<A>__{betty stares, slowly trying to take in her new surroundings. it looks like loma vista, but something is different. odd. cameras, lights, etc. all the apparatus of a tv show are in plain sight... and very disorienting.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh my gosh...i didn't know i was going to meet your friends today...i dressed a little casual.}
<A>__{he leads her to a taped mark on the floor as cast members appear, including jasmine and blake daniels.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's cute...listen, you got the part, and i'm directing. you've only got four lines today, so i thought i'd just spring it on you. no blocking or anything, just stand near the nurse's station... we're gonna do a quick walk through. alright?}
<A>__{he kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting lyla before she can respond.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{quiet on the set!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{traffic was terrible...}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{no, that's fine, we've only got seventy pages to shoot...take your time.}
<A>__{a stage manager hands betty a set of sides and an on set costumer tries to fit her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{excuse me. what are you doing?}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{we'll get you into hair and make up after this, just put this on...}
<A>__{the other actors take their positions. lyla watches from behind the cameras as david readies himself. chloe enters the set with kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{hi. i hear you're great. good luck...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what are you doing here? david...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{your lines'll are in the script, but you can ad lib.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ad lib?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{in fact, i want you to ad lib, that's the magic i'm after. i wanna give a whole new feel to the show.}
<A>__{she's sliding toward a complete meltdown.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{slate it!}
<A>__{george steps back behind the cameras. betty's still frozen to her spot, overwhelmed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{just do what you've been doing. watch the scene and on your cue take off from there.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{5 4 3 2...}
<A>__{chloe and blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop when they get to betty's cue. their faces loom around her menacingly. staring. the lights are impossibly bright. people begin to shuffle and stare at one another. lyla clears her throat as george bounds on stage, still smiling.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{betty?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{blake}
<P>__{(to chloe)}
<D>__{i think you stepped on my first line...}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{... i was talking to her.}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{do you need anything...?}
<A>__{she's freezing up. george approaches her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{betty, i thought this would be the best way. you know, throw you into it...}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if you need a minute, that's okay. but i thought you'd want to }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{david, i don't... can we talk privately for a second?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{stop calling me david. we're on set, for christ's sake, you don't have to call me david here.}
<A>__{as he pulls away betty grabs his arm.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{why are you doing this to me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why am i doing this to you? isn't this what you wanted?}
<A>__{lyla approaches.}

<D>__{is there a problem, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no! no problem, there is no...}
<P>__{(to betty, sotto)}
<D>__{what is the problem? just do that... thing... you do! come on! you drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!}
<A>__{george steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong. betty still hasn't moved. she's shaking with fear. the cast and crew members find it hard to look at her.}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{all right, everybody! that's ten minutes!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no! let me try this!}
<C>__{jasmine}
<P>__{(storming off)}
<D>__{this is bullshit!}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{forget it, george. it was a gamble, it didn't work. nice try.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{let me try this, goddamnit! she's been doing it all week, she can do it now!}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{i said forget it!}
<A>__{george throws down his script and rushes up to betty, who reaches out to him. he brushes her hands away.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, i don't know what you had in mind, but i hope you're happy. i put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what do you mean? what did i do to you...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{who put you up to this? did my ex wife ask you to...?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{david, please }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{stop calling me that! my name is not david, and if you really don't know the difference, you're more fucked up than i thought you were!}
<A>__{betty begins to cry.}
<C>__{stagehand}
<D>__{leave her alone, george!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{shut the fuck up!! you're a fucking grip, go grip something!!!}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{and you're not an actress, you're nothing but a soap opera groupie, aren't you? you have nothing better to do! do you?? well, why don't you get a fucking life, and stop ruining mine!}
<A>__{betty stands dead still as george continues to berate her. all sound slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly with a rush. suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm sorry...oh my gosh, are you george mccord?!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{...what? what did you call me?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{george...mccord. you're my favorite actor on...}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{she called you 'george,' george.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{...did i win some contest?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but i'm david... i mean, i'm not david, but she thinks i am! you heard her...}
<P>__{(looking around the group)}
<D>__{stop staring at me... i'm not crazy, she is!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{why are you screaming at me? i mean, what am i... why am i here? i don't...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're doing this now? after all the.. are you sick? are you going to kill me now?}

<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{... i'm sorry.}
<A>__{george watches betty walk off the set. the cast and crew try to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for lyla, who burns a hole into george's back. their eyes meet.}
