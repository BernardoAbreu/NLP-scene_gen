<L>__{exterior side of a road. very long shot. day.}
<A>__{ of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in texas. a light rain is falling. there are a lot of people gathered around, but the sound is an indistinct mixture of talk, laughter, etc. there follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific moments in the family reunion, thereby implying the entire tone of the proceedings. the sense of family pervades. montage. bonnie and mother. bonnie's mother, an old woman, grabs her and hugs her and cries. montage. bonnie, clyde, man. a man, an uncle perhaps, stands with bonnie and clyde, arms around them both, hugging them to his sides tightly. montage. bonnie and sister. bonnie's sister hands them a scrapbook of clippings.}
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{here you are, we been cuttin' and pastin' everything we could find about you in the papers.}
<A>__{clyde, bonnie, buck and blanche all look at the scrapbook. we see a page of it, showing newspaper articles with the photographs the gang took back at the motel.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{hey look, here's that one i took of you, clyde. that came out just fine!}
<A>__{montage. bonnie, clyde, man. bonnie and clyde are posing for a comic snapshot. a silly looking male relative is posing, pointing a gun at them. they have their hands in the air and are grinning broadly. (the effect should be funny and simultaneously frightening.) montage buck, small boy. buck is sitting with a little four year old on his knee, bouncing him up and down and singing. both are having a fine time.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{oh, horsey! keep your tail up, keep yer tail up, keep yer tail up, oh, horsey! keep yer tail up, why don't you make it rise.}
<A>__{montage c.w. a hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at c.w. he opens the bread to see what's inside it, then eats it. montage bonnie & sister. bonnie sits stock still while her sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car. he sister pauses, setting down the curling iron. she strokes bonnie's yellow head with her hand, as though she were a wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted. bonnie turns to see her sister's expression. they embrace. montage family picnic favoring clyde, mother & bonnie. clyde, in his best theatrical manner has been playing host in the sand pile, perhaps using some sort of towel across the arm or around the middle. the party is beginning to break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on eskimo pie.}
<C>__{bonnie's uncle}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{where y'all headed from here?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(right back)}
<D>__{i don't know, what y'all got in mind? at this point we ain't headin' to anywhere, we're just runnin' from.}
<A>__{clyde laughs, in fine spirits. reaction bonnie. she doesn't.}
<C>__{bonnie's sister's voice}
<D>__{c'mon, down, litte tom! we're goin' home. little tom? mathew, fetch little tom.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{don't go yet, mama.}
<C>__{uncle's voice}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{c'mere, c'mere you little corn roller.}
<A>__{wide angle. as uncle sweeps up the laughing little tom. reaction bonnie. bonnie turns with increased urgency to her mother, who, having been hefted to her feet by bonnie's sister, has turned to clyde, who gives her a big, boyish hug.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{...you know, clyde, i read about y'all in the papers and i'm jes' scared.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(to clyde)}
<D>__{sugar, make mama stay a while yet.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(ignoring bonnie, as}
<D>__{does mother,}
<P>__{ebulliently, even joshing)}
<D>__{now mrs. parker, don't y'all believe what you read in the papers! that's the law talking there. they want us to look big so's they'll look big when they catch us.}
<A>__{he knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces right along it's his style.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ and they can't do that. why, i'm even better at runnin' than robbin' banks aw shoot, if we done half the stuff they said we did, we'd be millionaires, wouldn't we, old sugar.}
<C>__{clyde }
<P>__{(he turns to bonnie}
<D>__{who continues to}
<P>__{stare at her mother)}
<D>__{and i wouldn't risk bonnie here just to make money, uncertain as times are. why one time i knowed of a job where we could of make $2000 easy, but i saw the law outside and i said to myself, why bonnie could get hurt here. so i just drove right on and let that money lay.}
<A>__{he waits for a response, as does bonnie. bonnie's mother smiles, a little abstractedly.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{...maybe you know the way with her, then. i'm just an old woman and i don't know nothin...}
<A>__{she trails off, looking nowhere in particular. clyde takes her reaction to mean that he's overwhelming her with his confidence, and continues to pour it on.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{we'll be quittin' this just as soon as the hard times is over, mother parker, i can tell you that. why me and bonnie were just talkin' the other day and we talked about when we'd settle down and get us a home, and bonnie said, "i couldn't bear to live morn'n three miles from my precious mother." now how'd you like that, mother parker?}
<A>__{bonnie's mother has undergone a funny sort of transformation during clyde's speech as if something had suddenly come into focus before the old woman's eyes.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't believe i would. i surely don't.}
<P>__{(to bonnie)}
<D>__{you try to live three miles from me and you won't live long, honey.}
<P>__{(to clyde)}
<D>__{you'd best keep runnin' and you know it, clyde barrow.}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{bye, baby.}
<A>__{she hugs bonnie who can barely respond. we move in for a closeup of bonnie as her various relatives, young and old come by to squeeze, kiss and hug her with a chirpy little chorus of bye, bonnie! bye, bonnie, bye, bye, bye.}
