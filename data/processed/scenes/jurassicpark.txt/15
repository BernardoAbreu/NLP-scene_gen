<A>__{grant and ellie share a baffled look. grant stares. grant's pov pan across a room filled with honey colored glowing stones arranged on glass shelves in large pull out trays. each stone is tagged and numbered. grant leans down, studying the stones. he bumps right into gennaro. lex jumps excitedly.}

<D>__{it's ... gold!}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{it's amber. fossilized tree sap.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{grandpa found gold.}
<A>__{grant shushes the kids and looks to hammond.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you're both right. amber is our gold. the alpha or our alchemic alphabet. the precious course of our genetic material. you already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.}
<A>__{grant and ellie nod impatiently. hammond sets the scene.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{imagine millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as i speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere. imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death. millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. if we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber. and as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects }
