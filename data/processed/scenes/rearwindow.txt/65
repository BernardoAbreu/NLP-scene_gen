<A>__{we get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. whoever he has called answers. and instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. he relaxes, smiles, is warm. he talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. in the bedroom, his wife has become aware of the call. quietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. the wall hides her from our view. then suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. he speaks quickly into the phone, and hangs up. his face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. in the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. she is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. she climbs in bed laughing. the more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen and has another drink. he stands there, controlling an outburst of emotion, and seems almost to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist.}
