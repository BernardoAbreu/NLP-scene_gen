<A>__{james steps unsteadily from the lincoln into the roadway, followed for an instant by vaughan's uncertain arm reaching for him. he moves away from the car, along the palisade to the overgrown entrance of the wrecker's yard. above him, the cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks.}
<L>__{exterior auto wrecker's yard night}
<A>__{just outside the fence of the auto wrecker's yard, a wreck, its engine and wheels removed, sits on its axles. james opens the door on its rusting hinges. a confetti of fragmented glass covers the front passenger seat. james gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against his chest wall. a moment or two of this strangely comforting foetal security, and then james unfolds and begins to get back out of the car. an engine starts with a roar. as james steps back into the roadway he is briefly aware of a heavy black vehicle accelerating toward him from the shadow of the overpass where he and vaughan embraced together. its white walled tires tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him. knowing that vaughan will not stop, will kill him, james presses himself against the concrete wall. the lincoln swerves after him, its right hand fender striking the rear wheel housing of the car james has just left. it swings away, ripping the open passenger door from its hinges. a column of exploding dust and torn newspaper rises into the air as it slides sideways across the access road. the lincoln remounts the curb on the far side of the road, crushing a ten yard section of the wooden palisade. james can see vaughan flicking a look back, his hard eyes calculating whether or not he can make a second pass at him. the rear wheels regain their traction on the road surface and the car swings away on to the motorway above. james leans against the roof of the abandoned car. the passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the deformed metal welded together by the impact. james retches suddenly and emptily. shreds of torn paper eddy through the air around him, pasting themselves at various points against the crushed door panel and radiator hood.}
