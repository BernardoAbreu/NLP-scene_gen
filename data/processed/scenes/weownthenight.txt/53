<A>__{joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. his face is blocked by hospital curtains. bobby steps forward. slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. he peels away the curtain. looks at joseph's face. joseph's visage is completely ravaged on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood. a terrible image. the emotion surges within him; he's heartbroken. it is a surprisingly painful moment. we can tell he didn't expect this level of destruction. his mouth drops open slightly. joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at bobby. bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches joe's arm gently. his fingers move down to his brother's hand. joseph is unresponsive but conscious. all of a sudden:}

<D>__{sir...?}
<A>__{joseph's hand closes around bobby's fingers. the connection is huge. bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion. it is a shocking outpouring of feeling from him. he leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:}
<C>__{nurse }
<D>__{sir, i'm sorry i.c.u. visiting hours are over.}
<A>__{he waits a beat. the nurse gently pulls his shoulder. he backs away, his eyes reddened. the camera moves into a close shot on bobby as we go to:}
