<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{the long line levels a road to a work tune being sung by jangle leg. dillard checks the thermometer on the truck 90 degrees and rising. mopping his brow, he starts down the line. the sun arcs overhead, a blazing inferno... heat rises off the road... the men sweat profusely... "taking it off here, boss!" echoes up and down the line. biscuit has his work cut out for him, lugging a water bucket from man to man, offering the ladle. the sun... the hammer... the ladle... the axe... the sun... the hammer... the ladle... the axe... the mercury hits 110 degrees... a new guy lets his hammer slip from his fingers, collapses in the dirt. radio nods to poker face, who hands him a pack of cigs.}

<D>__{man down, boss!}
<A>__{dillard uses his foot to roll the stricken man over. he's still alive. barely.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{you two, put him on the truck!}
<A>__{ray and claude drop their tools, grab the man by his arms and legs and lug him up to the road. once out of earshot, ray whispers to claude.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cookie drew me a map to greenville.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you know what i'm saying.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah, i know what your saying. and i'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's why we won't take the train. cookie showed me where there's a farm house. they got a boat there.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what do you know about boats? i bet you can't even swim.}
<A>__{they reach the truck. with effort, they swing the man back and forth and launch him into the back of the truck.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what i know about boats is they take you to freedom. come on, man. i think we can do this.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{why are you always talking about we? there is no we. there is a me, there is a you. but there is no we between us.}
