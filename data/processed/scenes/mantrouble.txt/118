<D>__{do me one favor, will you? say 'owner' if you want to, but don't say 'trainer.' i trained that dog.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(claps him on the shoulder)}
<D>__{let me think about that, okay?}
<A>__{he moves past him and out of frame. harry, watching lee's van pull away. in the rear window duke's face can be seen, looking back at him.}
