<L>__{exterior business street day}
<A>__{the business area is small and rather forlorn. the six of them walk in pairs dwight and caroline, skipper and norma, and last, toby and pearl. (toby's eyes are glued to the movement of norma's body.)}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(about a gas station)}
<D>__{and over there's where i work.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to skipper and norma)}
<D>__{how about you guys? you like it here?}
<A>__{they glance at each other.}
<C>__{skipper norma}
<A>__{fine. yeah, it's fine.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{it's a little isolated, is all.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{not that isolated.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{well, maybe not that isolated. pretty isolated, though.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{aw, there's plenty to do in concrete if you kids would take a little initiative. when i was growing up we didn't have t.v. we used our imaginations. we read the classics. we played musical instruments. you show me a bored kid, i will show you a lazy kid.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i didn't know you played an instrument, dwight. what do you play?}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(one half second's hesitation)}
<D>__{sax. tenor sax.}
<A>__{skipper and norma glance at each other, then look away. caroline takes a cigarette from her purse. again dwight jumps to her service: we are once more treated to the mini drama of dwight unsheathing the zippo from its velvet case, opening the top on his pants leg, etc.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(back to skipper and norma)}
<D>__{how's the school here?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{there isn't one. we go to chinook.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{chinook high.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{it's a few miles downriver.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{forty miles.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{come off it it's not that far.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{yeah, i clocked it: thirty nine miles.}
<A>__{in spite of the fact that he's eager for this day to go well, dwight's bottom teeth begin to show.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard. just shut your god damn pie hole.}
<A>__{they all shut their pie holes. the six walk in a tense, uncomfortable silence for five full beats. then pearl tries to help out:}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i'm in fifth grade.}
<A>__{nobody seems to care.}
