<A>__{yuri notices tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{daaadddy!}
<A>__{the bentley shoots out the back of the plane. as it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. the antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. they barrel past the bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. the plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the antonov, plunging into the deep. the plane crashes and explodes.}
