<A>__{a paratrooper officer looks at the blockades of rue du divan from a government palace balcony. mathieu is beside him.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{no one is leaving, eh?}
<A>__{the officer hands him the binoculars.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{no. they continue to enter, the rats.}
<A>__{mathieu looks through the binoculars, and comments in a low voice, smiling:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{rats in a trap, we hope ...}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{but do you believe that the strike will be widespread?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{without a doubt.}
<A>__{behind the two officers, through a large open window, a room is visible. there is a large table, and around it, other high officers of the various armed forces, and some important officials in plainclothes. a general, who has his back to the balcony, turns and calls mathieu:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{mathieu! mathieu, a name ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{a name?}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{yes, a name for the operation.}
<A>__{mathieu moves the binoculars from the blockades and turns slowly around the government square, until he reaches an advertising sign for a brand of champagne which now, in the dusk, lights up with a sporadic rhythm:}
<B>__{cordon ... rouge.}
<A>__{mathieu pauses then turns toward the room, and enters smiling:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{champagne ... all right?}
<A>__{the general repeats absent mindedly:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{champagne ... champagne.}
<P>__{(then, in a convinced voice)}
<D>__{operation champagne, yes, alright.}
