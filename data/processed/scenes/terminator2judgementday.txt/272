<A>__{advancing with sarah we enter the living area. tarissa has blythe and she's screaming at danny, who has run back to his collapsed father.}

<D>__{danny! danny!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{daaaaddddeeee!}
<A>__{danny is pulling at dyson, crying and screaming, as his father tries to stagger forward. tarissa drops blythe and runs back for dyson, grabbing him. sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed.}

<D>__{don't fucking move! don't fucking move!!}
<P>__{(she swings the gun on tarissa)}
<D>__{get on the floor, bitch! now!! fucking down! now!!}
<A>__{sarah is crazy eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment. the kill has gone bad, with screaming kids and the wife involved... things she never figured on. tarissa drops to the knees, terrified as she looks into the muzzle of the gun. blythe runs to dyson and hugs him, wailing.}
<C>__{blythe}
<D>__{don't hurt my father!}

<D>__{shut up, kid! get out of the way!!}
<A>__{dyson looks up, through his pain and incomprehension. why is this nightmare happening? the black gun muzzle is a foot from his face.}

<D>__{please... let... the kids... go...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{shut up! shut up!! motherfucker! it's all your fault! it's your fault!!}
<A>__{we see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate this man she doesn't know. it's a lot harder face to face. she is bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes. blinking, she wipes it fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun. the .45 is trembling. tight on sarah as we see the forces at war behind her eyes. she looks into the faces of dyson, tarissa, blythe, danny. sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract as she tenses to fire. but her finger won't do it. she lowers the gun very slowly. it drops to her side in one hand. all the breath and energy seems to go out of her. she weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like "stay where you are, don't move". as if, should they move, the fragile balance might tip back the other way. she backs away from them slowly, panting. it's as if she's backing away in terror from what she almost did. she reaches a wall and slumps against it. slides down to her knees. the gun falls limply from her fingers. she rests her cheek against the wall.}
