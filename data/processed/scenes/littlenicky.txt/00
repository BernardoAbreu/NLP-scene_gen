<L>__{exterior suburbia night}
<A>__{a beautiful late summer night. crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling. we pan across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see the peeper (jon lovitz) sitting on a limb. he has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a walkman. suddenly the lights turn on.}
<C>__{peeper}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{showtime!}
<A>__{we see a young mother walk into the room outside the peeper's window. she is wearing business attire.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{rough day at the office mrs. dunleavy?}
<P>__{(takes bite of sandwich)}
<D>__{well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats.}
<A>__{the mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{oh my g d, yes! i wish you would let me rub those feet. of course i wouldn't use my hands. heh heh heh heh...}
<A>__{he sips some wine. the mother starts to unbutton her blouse. she takes it off, revealing a nice bra.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{looks like victoria just told me her secret.}
<A>__{the peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook. mouthing the words as he goes.}
<C>__{peeper }

<P>__{(stops writing)}
<D>__{i will pleasure myself to this image for months. months i tell you!}
<A>__{the mother starts to unbutton her pants. her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{young scottie dunleavy. what unfortunate timing. you mother was just getting comfy.}
<A>__{the son talks to his mother excitedly.}
<C>__{peeper }

<A>__{the son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{now what. this simply won't do.}
<A>__{the peeper takes out a cell phone and dials. the son answers.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{hello, scottie. why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{just a little birdie. a birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh my g d scottie. is there a man up our tree?}
<A>__{the peeper gets nervous.}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{tell her no. tell her it's just a big bird.}
<A>__{the peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. we see scottie with his sling shot. the mother nods yes. he shoots it. it hits the peeper square in the head. he falls to the ground with a thud.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{mrs. dunleavy, please come help me. and wear your bikini.}
<A>__{the peeper looks up. he sees scottie pushing a television out the window. it lands on top of the peeper. he's dead.}
