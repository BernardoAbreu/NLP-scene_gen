<A>__{the barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi furtive glance toward the far end of the bar. other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar. it is early evening happy hour and the clientele is well heeled and sociable. a customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs. reverse camera continues movement (notes the combination of the high angle and the tilt of santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene). sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man (willie) stares morosely into his drink. the drink is clearly not his first. he wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom pom. he has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. his long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking. it exposes heavy black stubble. swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips. once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination. he takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down. after another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping. it is loud, dolorous, and unself conscious.}
