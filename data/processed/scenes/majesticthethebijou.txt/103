<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the same later luke and adele come over to harry and mrs. terwilliger, standing at the periphery. old tim stands a few feet back.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why don't you two get out there and dance?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, no, i...}
<A>__{mrs. terwilliger blushes.}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{i haven't danced with another man since mr. terwilliger passed.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{when was that?}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{nineteen oh nine.}
<A>__{harry touches luke's arm.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{son, we're gonna go. you two kids have a lovely time.}
<A>__{goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves. alex mckenna comes up to adele and taps her on the shoulder.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{delly, can i have a dance?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{alex leads her to the dance floor as adele shoots luke a little "help me!" look. luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd. after a moment, a man in a white suit and bow tie, roscoe fitts, 40s, comes over to luke and extends his hand.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{luke, you probably don't remember me, roscoe fitts, i'm the grocer here in town.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(shakes his hand)}
<D>__{good to meet you. again.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{like ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{and i hear you and harry are planning on re opening the bijou.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we're gonna try. place needs a lot of work.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{i can only imagine. you know, i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands. i don't think he gave it very much thought.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, he loves the place. it's his home.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{luke, i'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. i will come to the pointerior i want to buy the property, and i'm prepared to offer six thousand dollars for it. and that's just for the property, mind you. if you want, i will leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. i just want the land.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{that's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{the days of the storefront grocery are numbered. i plan on putting up a free standing supermarket.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(it's an alien word)}
<D>__{a super market. huh.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{you think it over. no reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.}
<A>__{fitts takes luke's hand and shakes it.}
<C>__{fitts}
<D>__{good to have you back, luke.}
<A>__{as luke watches fitts walk off, we}
