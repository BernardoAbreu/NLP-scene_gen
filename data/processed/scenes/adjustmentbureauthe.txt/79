<A>__{david stares idly out the window. his blackberry buzzes with a text message. looks down at it. then looks back out the window. suddenly his eyes snap into focus. david's pov: the bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk. david's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now. she walks like elise. she's dressed in the same eclectic style. he slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.}
