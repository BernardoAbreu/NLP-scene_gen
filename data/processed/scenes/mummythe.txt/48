<L>__{exterior base camp night}
<A>__{the two camps have now joined together. o'connell and beni are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. jonathan wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{what is this stuff? it smells like our late friend, the warden.}
<A>__{o'connell and beni both grin. jonathan looks horrified.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{you did not!?... we're not!?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{rat gizzards. they smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.}
<A>__{the gloating americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{say o'connell, whadaya think these honey's'll fetch back home?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{we hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy. congratulations.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{ya know if ya dry him out, you can sell him for firewood.}
<A>__{the americans laugh. evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a pile of big dusty bug skeletons onto the ground.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{scarabs, flesh eaters, i found them inside our friend's coffin. they can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse, or in this case...}
<A>__{she shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{famished.}
<A>__{o'connell and jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{very slowly.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{he certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{must of got a little too frisky with the pharaoh's daughter.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{according to my readings, our friend suffered the hom dai, the worst of all ancient egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. in all of my research, i've never read of this curse actually having been performed.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{that bad huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, they never used it because they feared it so. it's written, that if a victim of the hom dai should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{the ten plagues?... you mean all ten plagues.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{like what that moses guy did to that pharaoh guy?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{that's one way of putting it.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{let's see, there was frogs, flies, locusts...}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{hail and fire.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{the sun turning black.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{water turning to blood.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{and my personal favorite: people covered in boils and sores.}
<A>__{all the men share nervous looks, really spooked. evelyn just laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{fried gizzard anyone?}
