<L>__{interior "el" ecu frontal: ali night}
<A>__{and beyond the side of ali's face, elevated through the slums and decrepit tenements of the south side of chicago...the mean alleys and decaying back porches. men gathered around 50 gallon steel drums, burning wood for warmth. everything is corrupted or has left him. frontal: ali staring into nowhere. reverse: past ali the city recedes. vectors, in perspective, carry structures, buildings away. the sky is grey, going to blue. the city flees and suddenly disappears as we race into the dark tunnel of subway. ali's lost in the depths of attempting a calculation. he can't do that for which he has a genius beyond other men...}

<D>__{...you can't do what you do best in the world. and how you feed your family? from prison? who take care of your kids? and is allah, is god with me?}
<A>__{and he's been exiled from the belief system that explained the universe to him. suddenly lights slash across his face in the white tile north avenue station. beyond, ghostlike working men and two heavyset women enter. ali turns aside to prevent being recognized. it's the first time he's ever avoided the public. the train lurches forward... over ali: white light screams away from us. red reflects off the rails past ali's face as we descend deeper into the tunnels.}
