<A>__{the orchard is a different world; the dawn light illuminating dewy trees. rochester is silent. jane is trying to fathom him.}

<D>__{i'd do anything for you sir, anything that was right.}
<C>__{rochester}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{and if i ever bid you do what was wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet and pale and say 'i cannot do it.' and you'd be as immutable as a fixed star.}
<A>__{rochester, gazing at her, seems to have decided something. he turns a corner and is gone. jane is left alone. we hear the sound of a blow.}
