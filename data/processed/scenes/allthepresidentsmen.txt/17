<A>__{the newsroom as the triangle sound echoes. howard simons leaves large managing editor's office, walks past another office, knocks twice on the glass wall. inside the executive editor's office, ben bradlee sits. as simons knocks, he turns, nods. he appears, for the moment, deep in thought. harry rosenfeld on the opposite end of the room hurries out of his office, following a bunch of editors, all of them heading across the huge room. as he passes woodward's desk rosenfeld pauses.}
<C>__{rosenfeld}
<D>__{what'd you get on w.house?}
<C>__{woodward}
<P>__{(massaging his neck)}
<D>__{lotsa hints }

<P>__{(not happy)}
<D>__{i can't sell hints to simons }
<P>__{(stops, looks at piece of yellow paper)}
<D>__{ you called everyone you know?}
<P>__{(woodward makes a nod)}
<D>__{call someone you don't know.}
<A>__{woodward continues to rub his neck as rosenfeld hurries off, all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon faced man intermittently rings the triangle. woodward picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk. lined, legal sized, it is crammed with names and numbers and addresses. they are in no neat order; looking at them it's almost like following a path; chicken tracks in ink. woodward mutters "to hell with it" and reaches for a thick book, flips it open. now we see the book: it's the washington phone directory and we're in the w's. as woodward's finger stops, we can see he's looking at the white house entry number. there it is, just like your name and mine. listed. now woodward starts to dial, visibly nervous, a fact he tries very hard to keep out of his voice tone.}
