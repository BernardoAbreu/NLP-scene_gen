<A>__{rolling. crenshaw south. darktown.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{police blotter gets me bupkis. buzz dispatch. looking for license hits on that `32 ford deuce. nothing. zoom darktown again. zilch. tommy dug in deep.}
<A>__{startle, check my watch: 7:17 pm.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{shit.}
<L>__{interior hughes aircraft hangar evening}
<A>__{cruise in, crossing the hangar to pete.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{howard hughes. billionaire germ freak. boob man. pete's prime benefactor. nobody had seen him in years. me (v.o.) (cont'd) now he only communicated through a small standing army of lapdog lawyers he kept on staff.}
<A>__{a small, effete blonde man: geoffrey milteer extends his tiny hand, plastic cordial, rubbed raw from waiting...}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{gregory milteer. attorney at law. a pleasure lt. klein.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{dave. sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{indeed.}
<P>__{(motions to sit)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{we sit at a huge drafting table. i shoot a sidelong to pete.}
<C>__{milteer }
<D>__{thanks for your time on a sunday.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(a wink for pete)}
<D>__{where's mr. hughes?}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{unavailable. unfortunately. but i've been given full authority to }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ i'm not contagious...if that's what he's worried about.}
<A>__{pete hate scowls me: have your fun, asshole...}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{i don't find that the least bit humorous lt. klein.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{yes you do. what's your pitch mr. milteer?}
<A>__{milteer looks at pete. pete half shrugs. back to me now:}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{an `actress' named glenda bledsoe signed a service contract that she's now willfully violating by acting in a z grade horror picture presently `shooting' in griffith park. despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity, she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us. thus we would like her destroyed.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{what makes you think i can do a better job than your people?}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{mr. bondurant says you're one of the smarter people he knows }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ dubious honor if you knew the other people pete knows.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so you want to catch her in violation of her service contract? something like that?}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{exactly. the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating: nymphomaniac, criminal, communist...anything along these lines. once you visit the set of her `attack of the atomic vampires,' you'll see the void that is her character. we haven't a photograph handy, but she's playing the lead female role.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i'm happy to help. but my price is $10,000. not 5.}
<A>__{pete laughs out loud. milteer goes frigid.}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{$10,000 should buy more than help.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{for 10 give it any name you want. i'm a salaried employee of lapd, that means i will have to find time off hours to do this.}
<A>__{a long, cold moment drags...}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{agreed. start tonight. someone's been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. there's no proof that it's her, but it's her. peter will provide you addresses.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(faux fey)}
<D>__{thank you peter.}
<C>__{milteer}
<D>__{we look forward to your updates.}
