<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{the little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows, and steps into the basket. it begins to move upward, and the camera follows it. when the basket reaches the fire escape, the camera pans on to the apartment of miss torso. she is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem to be far away. the camera drops down to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid. for the first time we see something of her activities inside the apartment. she wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. she is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. it takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved. the camera moves on much farther to the left, and eventually comes to rest on the newly weds' apartment with the shade still drawn. it moves on and at last passes though jeff's window, and comes to rest on the two bid heads of jeff and lisa. her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{how far does a girl have to go before you notice her?}
<A>__{jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{if she's pretty enough, she doesn't have to go anywhere. she just has to "be".}
