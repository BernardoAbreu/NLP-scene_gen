<A>__{the walls have already been painted white. tables have been positioned. chairs are stacked, waiting. so are mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc. except for fred, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence is empty. fred scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a curved case cutter. several tablefuls of unloaded servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size of his job.}

<A>__{fred nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side exit. win, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.}
