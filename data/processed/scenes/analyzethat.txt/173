<A>__{police divers search for the sunken mercedes in the middle of the channel. on shore, ben leans against a government car looking tired and distraught while chapin berates him.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{where is he, dr. sobel?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i wish i knew.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{well, considering that he's in your custody, that's not quite the answer i was looking for. he's got something big in the works. you want to tell me what you know?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't know anything. as far as i can tell, he's making a real effort to go straight.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{yeah, that's why i've got two corpses at the bottom of the river.}
<A>__{he reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and pulls out a file of photographs.}
<C>__{chapin}
<D>__{here. vitti with sal masiello. vitti with patty lopresti. vitti with lou rigazzi. let me know i can order some wallet size for you. i've got more than enough to put him away again without these. violation of parole, second degree murder here. when i really start digging, it'll be amazing what i come up with. you have twenty four hours to find him and deliver him to me. otherwise you're looking at obstruction of justice, and accessory to felony manslaughter. and trust me, dr. sobel, if you don't like me now, you really don't want to see me in court.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm getting that. can i go now?}

<C>__{chapin}
