<L>__{exterior city hall day}
<A>__{mayor cryer stands beside chief davis and addresses a rather noisy and worked up press corps from behind a podium.}
<C>__{mayor cryer}
<D>__{gentlemen...gentlemen, please. as mayor of los angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of christine collins. as a result, we have decided that captain j. j. jones of the lincoln heights division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{what's the charge, chief?}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{the charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward mrs. collins. it further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating mrs. collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{mayor cryer, are you aware that the city council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the collins case?}
<C>__{mayor cryer}
<D>__{i've heard this, yes. but since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the city council would be to suspend captain jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{which makes it look like the only reason jones is being suspended is to head off the city council}
<P>__{(more)}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{investigation. are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain?}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{i won't even dignify that question with a response. good day.}
<A>__{the two head back into}
