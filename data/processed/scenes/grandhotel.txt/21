<A>__{baron, pimenov and meierheim}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{perhaps you could present me now, mr. pimenov.}
<C>__{pimenov}
<D>__{please, baron forgive me not now here she is.}
<A>__{grusinskaya sweeps into scene. the baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a glance at her. they look at each other. he fixes his eyes on her characteristically. she glances at him. this is the first time they have met in the picture. she is impatient. as if to break an awkward silence, she turns to suzette.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{my coat.}
<A>__{suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. as she takes the coat off her arm, grusinskaya glances down at the jewel case.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{suzette i told you not to bring the pearls. i will not wear them tonight.}
<C>__{meierheim}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{take them back, suzette.}
<C>__{meierheim}
<D>__{you haven't time.}
<A>__{suzette hesitates.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{hurry, suzette.}
<C>__{meierheim}
<D>__{such nonsense.}
<A>__{suzette toddles off with the pearls. the elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the baron and descends.}
<B>__{flash in}
<A>__{a shot of grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.}
<B>__{flash in}
<A>__{a shot of the reverse of him looking down. the baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. we are interested in his action. for the first time he becomes furtive. hotel lobby from elevators music swells up from the yellow room. a great deal of noise, confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit grusinskaya, followed by pimenov, meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the great grusinskaya.}
<C>__{meierheim}
<P>__{(off scene)}
<D>__{the car for madam grusinskaya.}
<A>__{the bellboy hears it and passes the word around. it seems to be echoed through the lobby. people turn, as grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting. the camera precedes her through the revolving door, as she sweeps outside of the hotel. the baron's chauffeur, schweinke, is seen to watch her go. he looks furtively around and enters the hotel.}
