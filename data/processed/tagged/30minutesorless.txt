<A>__{we don't see the driver, only the redlining rpms, vans slip ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. the wheel cranks right as the car turns onto a one way street. a minivan flies right at us. the mustang hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and garbage explodes like confetti. the wipers engage, brushing the trash aside. the car whips another turn and}

<B>__{tires screech}
<A>__{brake pads smoke. the mustang stops outside}
<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{the driver jumps out of the car. as he rushes to the front door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.}
<B>__{two large pizzas}
<A>__{before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15 year olds stare out.}
<D>__{15 year old that's 34 minutes. you're 4 minutes late. pizza's free.}
<A>__{reveal our guy staring back at the kids. this is will (25), probably good looking in another life. right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "giorgio's trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t shirt.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{gimme a break. you guys live two towns away. it's pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes. other 15 year old exactly. that's why we ordered from your shitty "trattoria."}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is gonna come out of my paycheck. you sure you don't want to take the moral high ground? other 15 year old we'd rather take the pizzas.}
<A>__{will takes a calming breath. hands over the pizzas.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ok. you guys are pretty smart. you figured out a way to beat the system.}
<P>__{(peeks inside)}
<D>__{got the house to yourselves? 15 year old that's right.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{not bad. any jailbait in there? little pizza and a rainbow party?}
<A>__{the kids shakes their heads.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{seriously? well, two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit, right? just call the girls up and let them know the party's on. 15 year old man, we don't have any of that stuff.}
<A>__{will makes a show of mulling this over.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i really shouldn't do this...but you seem like a couple of good dudes. i will tell you what, you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas, and i will grab you some beers.}
<C>__{will }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i get to keep the change as a tip. deal?}
<A>__{the kids look at each other. one hesitantly pulls out some cash. will snatches it and heads off.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will see you in like 20 minutes.}
<A>__{the kids look uncertain. as if sensing this, will stops before getting into his ride.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you boys like budweiser, right? 15 year old uh, yeah, totally. other 15 year old love that shit!}
<L>__{interior mustang day moving}
<A>__{the sun sets. will cruises back into his own middle class town in suburban maryland. a six pack of budweiser rests in the passenger seat. will stops at a light. checks out a pretty young thing in the jeep beside him. she catches him looking, rolls her eyes. the light turns and the jeep skids away. will self consciously removes his "giorgio's" cap.}
<L>__{interior giorgio's trattoria night}
<A>__{will enters and nods at christopher (40s), the manager. his balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's worth of pizza grease.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yo, chris. let me cash the fuck out.}
<A>__{will hands over some cash to christopher.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{you have a pretty good shift?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{for sure. i mean, the part where i had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{oh, yeah? 'cause, i got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off. promised to buy them beer or something.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right? so i'm gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{that's real funny. but i'm trying to run a business here.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes? it's ridiculous.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i don't wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses. you're fired.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on. if i didn't need this job, i wouldn't be doing this shitty job.}
<A>__{chris is unmoving.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck! whatever!}
<A>__{will storms off. as he gets to the door }
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{you know, you were an okay driver half the time. and you're not a puerto rican. which means something to me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's poignant.}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i guess i could rehire you, on a provisional basis. of course, this would be at the slightly reduced "new company rate."}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{are you fucking serious?}
<C>__{christopher}
<D>__{i don't know. is there anyone else left in town for you to work for?}
<A>__{will shakes his head. swallows what's left of his pride.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{when do i start?}
<L>__{exterior small apartment building night}
<A>__{will sits on the darkened front stoop. he tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer. he looks over at a parked hyundai elantra. a young man sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. he makes a sudden, surprised gasp. the homely young woman who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat. she leans over for a goodbye kiss. the young man obliges with much fanfare. the young man gets out and the car pulls away. this is chet (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the gap premium collection. he heads toward the building, high off his bj, humming outkast's "ms. jackson." he stops when he notices will in the shadows.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what the hell? have you just been sitting there?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yep. caught the whole show. really classy move at the end. you know, the kiss. putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight, in her car no less...i'm not gonna make her feel like an untouchable. i'm gonna make her feel like a lady.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what manners. may i offer you some alcohol, sir. to wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth.}
<A>__{will offers his beer. chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{by the way, she said she had a friend. maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk jackie fortunato and her cousin into having a four way with us.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i misread their body language. it happens.}
<A>__{will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on. let's go inside, drink your beer and watch shit get crazy.}
<P>__{(fans movies)}
<D>__{old favorites. you choose. lethal weapon, lethal weapon 2...was gonna get the third lethal weapon, but decided on a porn. so it's really between the first two.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i choose sleep. i gotta teach a class at eight.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're a sub. just call in sick. like the real teacher did.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{come on, man, you know i got promoted to full time last month. you bought me a laser pointer.}
<A>__{will heaves a sigh.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i guess i'm just having a hard time accepting you as "the man." you know, flunking kids, giving out spite detentions to girls you wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i also get healthcare and my summers off. it's not perfect, but it's a career.}
<A>__{will grudgingly stands up.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i guess that's just the difference between you and me.}
<A>__{he holds up the lethal weapon dvds.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm like riggs. cruising the streets. no rules, no attachments. every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge. you're fucking murtaugh. always worried about your pension. well, guess what, it gets old after the first movie.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i just got head. i'm totally riggs.}
<A>__{will shakes his head, turns and walks off.}
<L>__{interior studio apartment day}
<A>__{will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. his tv is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn. will looks down at his coffee table. clears some magazines to reveal a file folder. flips the cover it's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript. will thumbs through one of the glossy applications. the kids look young. very young. will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. they have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. will and the girl look very high and very happy. will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris. he looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 pm.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fuck.}
<L>__{interior mustang day}
<A>__{will jumps in and starts the engine. as he tucks his "giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you asshole. you titanic asshole. come on down and get your prize.}
<A>__{he makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls the trigger and boom!}
<C>__{we're in}
<L>__{exterior open field day}
<A>__{a watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. loud, dumb laughter echoes. standing 20 yards away is dwayne (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless baltimore ravens t shirt. on his left bicep is a tattoo of the tasmanian devil flipping the bird.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fruit motherfuckin' salad!}
<A>__{crouched beside him is jay (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap. he carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at dwayne. his eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses. there's a peculiar eagerness to please in them.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{this one's gonna blow even bigger.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{whatever. i don't need the military. i taught myself how to do this shit.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i hear that. i taught myself how to eat pussy. and cut my own hair.}
<A>__{jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. he returns and pulls out a detonator. dwayne snatches it.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{this one's all me.}
<P>__{(makes "radio" sounds)}
<D>__{mr. president, we have enemies at the gate. give me the order.}
<P>__{(more "radio" sounds)}
<D>__{fuck that, sir. i don't negotiate with terrorists!}
<A>__{dwayne presses a button and boom! the explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice.}
<L>__{interior kitchen, nice house day}
<A>__{large and early 90s chic. dwayne and jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{wanna make sure i get enough calories.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer. bang that towel girl at the community pool.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's obvious you don't know shit all about physical fitness. you gotta bulk up first, then you slim down. i'm clearly in the bulk up phase. i told you to watch pumping iron like a month ago. if you'd listened to me, maybe you'd know what the fuck i'm talking about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{grab some rc cola.}
<L>__{interior living room, nice house day}
<A>__{the shades are drawn. we hear a girl scream bloody murder! the guys are watching friday the 13th part 3...in 3d. they both wear cheap cardboard glasses. jay jumps back as jason wields a 3d ax.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shit, man! it's so real!}
<A>__{dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3d images. he stands and starts humping the air.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{check it out. i ain't afraid of jason. i'm fucking him.}
<P>__{(thrusting harder)}
<D>__{you like that, jason!? in the mask!}
<A>__{jay cracks up. the lights flick on.}
<C>__{grizzled voice }
<D>__{who are you two fags fucking?}
<A>__{standing by the switch is dwayne's dad, jerry (70s). most people just call him "the major." the faded usmc tattoo on his thick forearm explains why.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{afternoon, major.}
<A>__{dwayne flops back onto the couch.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{dad, we're watching a flick. we got 45 minutes and a potential 3d sex scene left. you're sorta coming in at the worst possible moment.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i bought that tv set so i could watch my programs, not so you and your friend could louse up my couch.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you gotta learn how to share the common space.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{the only thing common in this house is you. you remind me of your damn mother. fat, dumb, and in my way.}
<A>__{the major grabs dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. he gets right in his face...scary, intense. dwayne turns to jay.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{let's get outta here. this movie sucks anyway.}
<A>__{jay gets up and files out the door. dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate. the major grabs his arm.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i paid for the damn cold cuts, too. maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect, or a clue how to find any of the above, i'd let you eat 'em.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you know, you can be a real sonofabitch, dad.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{that's what it takes, boy. in the corps, men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's pretty fucking disturbing!}
<A>__{dwayne storms off.}
<L>__{exterior nice house day}
<A>__{dwayne and jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway. dwayne spits on it.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck the major!}

<L>__{interior dive strip club day}
<A>__{r. kelly's "ignition (remix)" pumps. large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples, shake before us. their owner, juicy (27), a petite latina, phones in a lap dance as dwayne pours his heart out to her. somewhere in the background, jay hangs at the bar, all alone.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{ and he thinks he knows me. he don't know shit. i got ideas he could never dream of. i got plans bigger than his fucking house.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he didn't even raise me. my mother did. that was a good woman.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{oh yeah? what happened to her?}
<A>__{dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{she passed on.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{i hope you're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i wouldn't mind nursing on them titties, mamacita.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{sure. whatever you say. maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i wish i could forget about that asshole for good. i'm just waiting around for him to drop dead. don't wanna mess with my inheritance.}
<A>__{this piques juicy's interest.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{what kinda inheritance?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{when my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets. he'd play his dog tag numbers. in '91, the fucker won five million bucks.}
<A>__{insert photo: the major holding a giant cardboard check.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{he had some health problems a few years back, and since then he's been burning through the money like an nba draft pick. probably only got a million or two left. but it's mine as soon as he kicks.}
<A>__{behind inch long fake eyelashes, juicy's shrewd eyes narrow, mind working. she straddles dwayne, tightly.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{you know, with a million bucks, you could have anything. be like a king.}
<P>__{(almost a moan)}
<D>__{king dwayne.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's right. and maybe i will make you my queen. let you polish my royal scepter.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{practice makes perfect.}
<A>__{juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. dwayne is blissed out. she smiles at him, sticky sweet.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{let me ask you a question...do you really hate your daddy?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{hate him like the steelers.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{then maybe i can help you get that money now. before he spends another penny.}
<A>__{dwayne looks confused. juicy puts his hands on her breasts, emboldening him.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{i know a guy in baltimore. he could help you out. probably do it for...}
<P>__{(sizing him up)}
<D>__{...100gs.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{juicy leans in, whispers softly in dwayne's ear }
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{kill your mean old dad.}
<A>__{on dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.}

<A>__{will has one pizza left in the back of his car. he pulls over outside an office building.}
<L>__{interior law firm, office building night}
<A>__{rows of cubicles. speckled with late night stragglers, bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{rio?}
<A>__{kate (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. she has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. this is the girl from the picture in will's apartment.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's the plan. five days, six nights. culture. beaches. acceptable probability of kidnapping. i leave in the morning.}
<A>__{kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an expedia checkout page for a rio vacation. she moves the mouse pointer from the "proceed" key...closes the window.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{this morning i loaded up an african safari and a cruise to alaska.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, the places you'll go.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{fuck expedia. travel advisor. making it seem so easy.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it is. just do it. get away for a while.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{even if i could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ok. done. i've got my dose of the actual working world. can we eat?}
<A>__{will lays a pizza down on her desk.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{he's there like half the time. the other half i smile at him. i'm relatively certain he's a homosexual.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{interesting theory...}
<A>__{kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{maybe i should set him up with tom small. he came out to me today on facebook.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that kid beat the hell out of me and chet in grammar school. wow.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{tell me about it. he fingered me at junior prom while they were playing "no scrubs."}

<A>__{will grabs a slice. they eat quietly for a beat.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so, i've got some news...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i thought the tom small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm getting back together with mark.}
<A>__{will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. he does his best to swallow it down.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{but you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship. finality was had.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yeah, but we were talking and }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{forget it. i don't want to know.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you sound like chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{woah, don't compare me to your brother.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well, neither one of you seems to care that i don't have a life. mark's not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every friday because i have nowhere else to be.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sure. i get it. here we are. friday night. nowhere to be.}
<A>__{kate shoves will, good naturedly.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{will shrugs, quietly devastated. goes back to his pizza.}
<L>__{interior sports bar night}
<A>__{most of the patrons are fixated on an orioles game blaring from a large flat screen tv. at a booth in back, dwayne and jay are in deep conversation.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't wanna stick my nose into a family matter...but killing your old man? that's pretty messed up...i mean, unless you think it isn't.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{what we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate. you got one evil: me shaving a few years off the major's shitty life. then you got the other evil: the major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. maybe i'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i guess i...sorta see where you're coming from. and you have been waiting around forever for that money. you deserve it, dwayne.}
<A>__{dwayne nods, seriously.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you know, there's a reason i sleep 'til noon everyday. and it ain't 'cause i'm lazy. it's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. big ones. and once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true.}
<A>__{dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{like i had this one dream last night. i was cruising through town in a lamborghini diablo. the wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. there was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. and in the back seat, jay...was you. strapped. wearing a pair of oakleys.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{wow. i didn't know you dreamt about me, dwayne.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it was only this once, jay. to be honest, i didn't know what to make of it. so i consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog. you got my back.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{that's why i want to make you my partner.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{in what?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{in crime. and business. you see, it ain't just about the inheritance money. it's about what i'm gonna do with it.}
<A>__{dwayne leans across the table.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm about to clue you in on something. and then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here. are you ready?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yes. i'm totally ready.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{then answer me this...what's this town missing? i will give you a hinterior it's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a chinese food restaurant?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no. a tanning salon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{think about it. all that green. all that brown flesh.}
<A>__{jay nods, thinking about. he smiles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah, of course. because of the booths.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yes. and because of the bitches.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it can all be ours. 30 percent for you, 70 percent for me. you just gotta help me out here.}
<A>__{jay looks conflicted. dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog. maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's crazy. i'd never do something like that. the dream book was right!}
<A>__{jay looks dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ok. i will do it. but i'm not shooting him or anything. i will hold him while you shoot him. that's it.}
<A>__{dwayne chuckles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. shit, they got three different types of csi on tv, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself.}

<D>__{i was presented with an opportunity. i took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but we don't have that kinda money.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand? 'cause once we get that, we get the million.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{and once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it.}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can do that.}
<A>__{will opens the door, stops, looks back at chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{will heads out. chet takes a breath, bracing himself.}
<L>__{interior hallway, junior high school day}
<A>__{will walks down the empty hallway. he glances back over his shoulder, where chet walks several feet behind him.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yes, i'm still here. i really am this stupid. just pay attention to where you're going.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think i can handle it.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{these floors get waxed once a week. on tuesday, which today is. you hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and i got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{chet, i'm fucking nervous enough as it is. please. i don't need you back seat driving me right now.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{will stops, turns back toward chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. and there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway. if i fall, and if this thing goes off, i'm probably not taking out the whole school.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{do you really want to debate this?}
<A>__{will sighs, turns back around. a second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes. will freezes. multiple kids shove past him. chet sweats bullets, gives will a look of death. after a beat, the hallway empties again.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{whatever. it's over.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{you know why.}

<D>__{oh, come on. just keep walking.}

<D>__{come on yourself. you knew exactly who i was talking about.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{fuck you. she's in the eighth grade.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i bet you love it when she calls you mr. chet.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{she doesn't call me "mr. chet." she's not a foreigner.}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{...thanks so much, mrs. davis. i will call you after i talk to the doctor.}
<A>__{chet hangs up. he is standing by the passenger door. he looks over the roof of the car at will.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{so, this is it?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is what?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{once i step inside this car, i'm basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. and if it goes off, all they're gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. they'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. it'll be all over the news. next thing you now, some militia or islam group is claiming us as members. my family will be humiliated.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we'll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won't really matter.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{exactly!}
<A>__{will sighs.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i get it. take your time, man.}
<A>__{will gets in the car and shuts the door. he looks out at chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.}

<A>__{chet reluctantly hops in.}

<D>__{okay, so where are we going?}

<D>__{no plan. i can't say i'm surprised.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{your plan is probably better. just condescend me until i explode.}
<A>__{will goes to turn on the radio. chet grabs his hand.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{maybe we should turn on the radio. see if the signal sets the bomb off. that would be an interesting experiment.}
<A>__{will heaves a frustrated sigh. chet eases up.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{listen, let's just go back to my place. figure out our options. maybe you can get the vest off or something. i just don't want to do anything stupid.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{unless we have to.}
<A>__{the car hits a rough pothole. chet's heart skips a beat }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{holy fucking shit!}
<A>__{ and he throws himself against the passenger side window, as far from will as the confines of the car will allow. will slams the brakes.}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{okay. okay. fuck!}
<A>__{chet makes the sign of the cross.}
<C>__{chet}

<D>__{i saw you.}

<D>__{it's in case i have to jump out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{if i survive the day, and you don't because you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck, i'm gonna laugh my ass off.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's too tight!}
<A>__{he is calling off toward the}

<C>__{will }
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{well, all these sites say different shit. there's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is pointless.}
<A>__{chet shuts his laptop.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i agree. we gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we can't. these guys said they'd be following me. and i don't have a clue what they look like. for all i know, they're outside right now. they see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses.}

<C>__{chet}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, it's not! i'm gonna blow up! that's way worse than getting stabbed or shot. at least some people survive that. no one survives being blown up.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{no one is ever like, "yeah, i heard steve got blown up, tough break, but how's he doing now? is he still in the rec basketball league?" no of course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing left of steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops!}
<A>__{chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. it's a crushing sight. chet strides across the apartment }

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{sorry. shit. i didn't mean to do that. but just listen to me now. you're not gonna die. you wanna know why? because you know exactly how to rob a bank.}

<D>__{point break.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the movie?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yes. that movie is like a how to guide for bank robberies. you just bust in. masks. guns. move fast. stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah...i guess it's pretty simple, right? and it's just a local bank. the donner wells on charles road.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{really? i applied for a job there like a year ago.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you wanted to be a teller?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yeah, so what? it's a good job. you get benefits.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{like what, a name tag?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what kind of benefits do you get? free toppings?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's really clever. no one ever said that shit to me before. anyway, this is perfect. you know the whole layout of the bank.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{not exactly. they didn't hand me the security schematics with the application. but i sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. i know what the place looks like.}

<D>__{a whole lot of shit. i'm sorry to do this to you, but i was afraid i'd never get the chance to tell you. and i know you have feelings for me, too. maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or if the world fucking hates me a brother.}

<C>__{chet}
<D>__{why? so you have more time to delude my sister?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yes. and it'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone.}
<A>__{chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you really think she's into you?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(swallows hard)}
<D>__{i kissed her last night. no tongue. then you walked in.}
<A>__{chet just nods. will gets up.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you're gonna go fuck my sister now, aren't you?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will be thinking of you the whole time.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{at the very least...be a considerate lover. give pleasure, before taking pleasure.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think i'm reading you. and i will try my best.}
<A>__{will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. kate opens the door, steps out onto the porch. will stops, looks back at chet. he whistles. chet turns.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're riggs! you always have been!}
<A>__{chet smiles, shakes his head as will reaches the porch. he stands close to kate. his nerves clock overtime.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i lied and told your brother i kissed you. i thought it would make this easier.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{here's an idea: pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest. tick, tick }
<A>__{will closes the gap and kisses her. after a beat }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{is chet watching us?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{probably. we should go inside. i promised him i'd satisfy you.}
<A>__{kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to }
<C>__{black}
<B>__{credits roll.}
<A>__{but they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other side is filled with a lo fi, 2001 style light tunnel. it deposits us in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find a tanning bed. rotating in orbit. dwayne's voice booms and}
<D>__{reverberates }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{grand opening spectacularrr!}
<A>__{the tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. from the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:}
<C>__{major tan}
<A>__{a bad match cut : takes us to the same logo. camera zooms out unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall storefront. we are watching a local commercial with appropriately poor production value.}
<L>__{interior major tan day (local commercial)}
<A>__{dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera and trying not to trip }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{here at major tan, our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that harness the power of the sun, to ensure a cutting edge tanning experience.}
<A>__{dwayne enters a tanning room. a man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific equation is written.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{how's it looking?}
<A>__{the man turns: it's jay. his smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it's our most advanced tanning bed yet!}
<A>__{he gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{hey, don't just take this scientist's word for it. the proof...}
<A>__{dwayne snaps his fingers. a bad special effect makes him disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{...is in the tan.}
<A>__{we follow dwayne back out into the hallway.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{but major tan isn't just about looking good. it's also about feeling good.}
<A>__{dwayne gestures to another room. the door opens and juicy saunters out in a bikini. a beat later, a random guy exits.}
<C>__{random guy}
<D>__{that "deluxe tan" was fantastic!}
<L>__{exterior major tan day (local commercial)}
<A>__{dwayne stands outside the store.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{so come on down to major tan...where we're proud to be a family business.}
<A>__{pull back to reveal...the major beside dwayne. he's only about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. but he's grinning like a jackal, in a pow mia cap. a supered logo appears: military discounts available! as father and son smile and wave at us }
<B>__{end commercial.}
