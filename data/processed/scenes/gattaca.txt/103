<L>__{int exterior irene's car. night.}
<A>__{irene drives, jerome at her side. cars are being flagged down by uniformed police officers. irene slows down behind the car in front. spying an officer shine a flashlight in the eyes of the male driver up ahead, jerome wipes the contact lenses from his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when irene is not looking. an officer approaches jerome and, without a word, opens an electronic testing kit worn on his hip. he removes a sterilized q tip and motions for jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape a culture. jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth, feigning embarrassment.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(conspiratorial)}
<D>__{better not.}
<P>__{(nodding in irene's direction)}
<D>__{don't want to give you a contaminated specimen...if you get my meaning.}
<A>__{irene plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop. we see an extreme close up of jerome's hand as he furtively retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff. with the hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment. the cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle and places it in a receptacle in his kit. after a short moment the hair confirms jerome's driving id which appears on the kit's electronic screen. as the cop departs, irene looks questioningly at jerome.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(answering her unasked question)}
<D>__{you never know where those swabs have been.}
<A>__{irene nods, however clearly not convinced. she shakes the doubt from her mind.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i want to show you something.}
<A>__{she accelerates away. we see the road ahead from jerome's pov. without his contact lenses, it is a blur.}
