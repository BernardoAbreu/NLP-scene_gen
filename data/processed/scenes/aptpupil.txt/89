<C>__{todd}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he hangs up. he sits down across from dussander. the old man is near death, but through the slit of an eye he watches todd. the stare between them is lethal. for a long moment this continues until...}

<A>__{todd turns to go and stops.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{are you crazy? i don't read german, you numb fuck.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why would willi write me in english? if you were to read me the letter in german, i would understand even though you would not. your pronunciation would be terrible, but i could manage }

<D>__{all right. all right.}
<A>__{todd dashes out of the room.}
