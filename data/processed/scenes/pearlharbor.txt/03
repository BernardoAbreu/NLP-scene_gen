<L>__{exterior new jersey air base day}
<A>__{american p 40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming and wind singing by their wings. there are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we focus on two: rafe mccawley has grown lean and handsome. and danny walker is very much the same. their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while the other guys are flying along in a tight line, rafe and danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high, the other diving and coming back up in his place, leapfrogging. it scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and out, so close. the training captain, watching through binoculars on the ground, talks into his radio }
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{mccawley! walker! cut that out!}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i thought this was a training flight. i'm just trying to give danny some training.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{not on your best day, boy!}
<A>__{rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction he was moving before. danny reacts almost instantly... leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out of everybody else.}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{that's it, get into a wedge!}
<A>__{the squadron responds, forming up into a tight v, rafe and danny just behind and on either side of the center.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{didn't you say test the limits?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground...cause i got no limits in the air!}
<A>__{rafe grins, loving the challenge. then he and danny do the leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the v.}
<C>__{training captain}
<D>__{everybody down!}
