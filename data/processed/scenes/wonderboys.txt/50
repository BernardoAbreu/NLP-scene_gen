<L>__{interior grady's office}
<A>__{grady enters with a thermos pauses redistributes the sleeping bag over james leer's pale body.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(without waking)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{grady sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. next, he takes a clean piece of paper, balls it up, and with ritual precision strokes it into the miniature basketball hoop that crowns the rim of the waste basket across the room. all net. a 9 volt crowd roar belches from the hoop and, without further ceremony, grady turns to the blank page curling from his ibm selectric and spaces to the top right corner, types:}
<P>__{(beat) 2611}
<A>__{in other words: page 2611. close up the typewriter paper darkening with words, the keys snapping faster and faster, a crazy clamor that grows and grows until, finally, it just ....stops.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james i}
<A>__{grady awakes with his back to the floor, james leer's quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm okay. i just lost my balance.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i put you on the floor.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i thought you might l don't know swallow your tongue or something.}
<P>__{(nodding to grady's robe)}
<D>__{i guess you really miss her, huh?}
<A>__{grady peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe, its overall fuzziness.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{huh? oh, no. this isn't emily's. i just write in it.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i guess there's probably a story behind that.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{there is, but it's not that interesting.}
<A>__{james nods. down the hallway, in another room, the}
<B>__{telephone rings.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{want me to get that?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{as james shuffles away in the sleeping bag, grady rises delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to see a police car roil slowly by on the screen below.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(returning)}
<D>__{he didn't give his name.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{the guy on the phone.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what'd he say?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{he wanted to know if a grady trip? lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what'd you tell him?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{good, james. if the zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. is that single spaced?}
<A>__{james has noticed the towering stack of 20 ib. bond on grady's desk.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{afraid so.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's a big book you're writing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i think it's sort of writing itself at this pointerior}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{wow, hannah always swore you were working, but }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{but . . . ?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since arsonist's daughter, and some people some of the kids in workshop thought maybe you were...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{washed up?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{blocked.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{ah. i don't believe in writer's block.}
<A>__{james takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<A>__{a loud hacking is heard. grady and james turn, watch crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, materialize in the hallway.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{good morning, boys. james.}
<A>__{james waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(re: james' "attire")}
<D>__{if you 're planning on staying for breakfast, i'd put on something a little less comfortable if i were you.}
<A>__{as grady moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, james continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway. the sight of crabtree seems to have made him suddenly queasy.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{professor tripp?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hm.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{how did i get here last night?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no one seems to know where you live, james. hannah thought you'd like my couch.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{and ...and before that. did i do anything? anything bad?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well, james, you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.}
<A>__{as james contemplates this, the doorbell rings. grady looks up, sees the police car he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{do yourself a favor, james ...hide.}
