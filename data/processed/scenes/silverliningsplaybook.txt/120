<A>__{pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{can we do something else besides the dance deal?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{are you fucking kidding me?}

<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{a deal is a deal.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i know. okay. i was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{why don't you walk towards me like i'm nikki. and the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. by your slow walk. you can't talk.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i'm not doing it.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{only walk. do it.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no. that's stupid.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{no walk, no letter. walk to me like i'm nikki, come on. do it. i'm nikki. come on.}
<C>__{pat}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{you're not nikki.}
<B>__{pat reluctantly walks.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{don't look up until you're halfway here.}

<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{that's right.}
<B>__{pat walks to her.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{not yet.}
<B>__{pat as he stops face to face with tiffany and looks her in the eyes.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{yes. do you feel that? that's emotion.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i don't feel anything.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{has anybody ever told you how tommy died?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{we were married for three years and five days, and i loved him. but for the last couple months, i just wasn't into sex at all. it just felt like we were so different and i was depressed. some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and i have a hard enough time taking care of myself. i don't think that makes me a criminal. anyway one night after dinner, he drove to victoria's secret at king of prussia mall and got some lingerie to get something going. and on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. and the victoria's secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) that's a feeling.}
