<A>__{the chief (50's) sits, arms folded. the detectives are present. eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos, reports, concezio and his capos.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{and that's all she wrote. everything points in the same direction.}
<A>__{she taps yakavetta's picture on the wall.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{why would yakavetta want them back here? him of all people.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{to have them executed. revenge. oldest motive in the book.}

<D>__{the saints killed his daddy six years ago, right? he was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion.}
<C>__{dolly}

<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{walk with me, chief. let's talk.}
<A>__{he stands and she takes his arm as they exit. duffy quietly closes the door and turns. hushed tones...}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{this is not good. she's gunning for the boys hard.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{this brawd, trying to put a feather in her cap is gonna get us locked up.}
