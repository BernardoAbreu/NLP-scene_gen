<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{that's it! no man lives who can call a firefly an upstart.}
<A>__{without further ado, groucho strikes trentino across the face with his gauntlets. then he quickly flashes his card and extends it to trentino in the manner of a duelist.}

<P>__{(as he offers the card)}
<D>__{touche.}
<A>__{a sudden ripple of excitement as the guests, attracted by the rumpus begin to move into the scene. prominent among these is vera trentino. trentino refuses groucho's card, white with rage.}

<D>__{my country has spoken.}
<A>__{he turns on his heel as if about to leave. groucho stops him}

<A>__{the above lies are spoken in meter and each line is punctuated by the staccato notes of the trumpet. groucho makes a military exit from scene in time to the music, which goes into a military march. as groucho reaches the gate, the guard hands him his high silk hat. groucho takes the hat removes a white rabbit from it hands it to the guard as he exits through gate.}
