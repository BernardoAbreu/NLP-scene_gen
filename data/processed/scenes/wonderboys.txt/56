<A>__{grady, squinting through the ten inch panel of cleared ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in front of walter and sara gaskell's house ...then off.}

<A>__{grady pops the glovebox, takes out a pen, and scratches something on the gift card attached to the balloon. james glances briefly at a plump ziploc of pot stashed in the glovebox, then peers at the house.}

<P>__{(the house)}
<D>__{isn't this...?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{grady gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between james legs. it's about half down.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you better ease off that stuff, james. it's pretty acidic.}
<A>__{james takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i can't help myself. i don't know what's the matter with me.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shit, james, you're hungover. what do you think's the matter with you?}
<A>__{as grady turns away, james ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re sets the donut in precisely the same place.}
