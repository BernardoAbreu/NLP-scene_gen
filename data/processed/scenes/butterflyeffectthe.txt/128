<L>__{exterior college quad night}
<A>__{kayleigh and evan walk through the all but deserted campus. evan seems especially paranoid. in the distance, some guy vomits loudly.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{it's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{like how?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i don't know. you seem... different. you make weird jokes. your accents changed. you don't even walk the same.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i walk differently?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. even the dinner tonight. it was beautiful, but...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i know i've been actin strange lately. it's just that... i don't want anything to happen to us.}
<A>__{the guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. kayleigh and evan instinctively avert their eyes. suddenly, kayleigh's ears perk and she stops walking mid stride.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{wait. something's not right. isn't that your jacket?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the guy, wearing evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{tommy.}
<A>__{tommy has grown in the last seven years. he has long, greasy hair and some tattoos. he holds a tire thumper (a short, steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand. evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{leave us alone you sick fuck!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{get this "us" shit. as if i was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. you've done nicely for yourself, evan. nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{shut up, tommy!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{aw, hey now, that was a compliment.}
<A>__{tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{it wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think i was a piece of shit.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(suppressing panic)}
<D>__{no one thinks you're a piece of shit, tommy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{right, evan. i believe you just said "sick fuck."}
<A>__{tommy rushes evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs. evan goes down. as tommy prepares to bash his brains in, evan whips out the pepper spray and nails tommy in the face. tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand. evan struggles to his feet and circles around tommy, keeping a distance as he douses tommy with pepper spray. kayleigh screams. tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. evan charges forward in an uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of tommy's hands and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into tommy's open mouth.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{evan, stop! you're gonna kill him!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{he's a fucking maniac!}
<A>__{evan knocks tommy down with the tire thumper. kayleigh screams and tries to hold evan back, but he easily wrestles free of her. she runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{he ruined lenny's life }
<A>__{evan kicks tommy hard in the ribs. kayleigh pushes a button on the "blue light" lamp post and an alarm wails.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{he killed crockett }
<P>__{(kicks him)}
<D>__{murdered that woman and her baby!}
<P>__{(kicks again)}
<D>__{and he's trying to kill me, kayleigh! he's trying to fucking kill me!}
<A>__{evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down off camera. crunch! evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. kayleigh sees what evan's done to her brother. and stops cold when she sees the damage to tommy. evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion. sirens come racing to the quad. evan looks away from tommy's limp body. collapses to the ground and begins to weep.}
