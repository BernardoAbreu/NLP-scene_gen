<L>__{interior loft sunrise}
<A>__{close on the model museum in early light. propped against it, the unrolled vermeer. pinned to the painting, a note we can't read. in the b.g., hear what sounds like the rattling of a subway train, which runs a short distance and stops. we tilt angle now, to see... ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door. mac's head appears, peeking up over the lip.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ginny...?}
<A>__{lost in another brief subway rumble. he lightly vaults up through the doorway. looks around, no gin. goes to the model. lifts the note pinned to the vermeer...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{this lovely parting gift can be yours. if the price is right.}
<A>__{stumped. not in his cultural database. he looks at the model, to see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been lifted away, revealing... ...an underground railway tunnel between the two. mac examines the tiny train, the tracks, the winding route. from the side walls, well above the tracks, huge ventilation pipes open onto the tunnel. starting at the museum end, they are labeled vent #1, and so on. there are five. the last one shortly before... ...the mountain. where a cavernous opening is labeled barracks. tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot at the oncoming train. and as mac studies this curiously... ...the nearby subway rattles the walls once more. sounds like it's in the room, somehow. mac rises. saunters across the loft, and we see for the first time the enormity of this space. suddenly, the floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto... ...a spacious hangar, outfitted with 150 feet of railway track, at the far end of which sits a full sited train car, exactly like the one in the model. and just below us... ...gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen feet above the track. she holds a remote control device, which she uses to rev the train's engine, far down the line. she looks really tense.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{she startles slightly. shuts off the train's engine. as she looks up to him now, the silence is noticeable. he crouches down, only a foot or so above her...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{quite a parting gift. i would have settled for roses.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{it's a joke. you know, a joke? people who have a sense of humor make them?}
<A>__{he's clueless. but smiling.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're rich, go buy an american, have him fill you in on the culture.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ah. american culture. well, that is a joke.}
<A>__{he leans down. strokes her hair very gently.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{relax. it's only eight billion dollars.}
<A>__{she looks up into his eyes. but she can't smile.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{your vermeer? i like this view of delft better than the larger one. the sky is more emotionally rendered.}
<A>__{staring in his eyes. and just as softly back...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{nice. when a sky is that.}
<A>__{he holds the look. very strong and very gentle...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{is it easier now? not pretending.}
<A>__{is it?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{not pretending you're an innocent. not pretending you...like me.}
<A>__{no answer. effortlessly, he hops down to join her. never losing eye contact.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{here's a tip from an old timer. never forget who you are...}
<A>__{settles next to her. bodies touching.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it gives you someone to be. when you stop pretending.}
<A>__{okay? she nods, slowly. her eyes moving over his face. maybe more feelings going through her than she can sort out.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{so. our train runs from the museum, through an underground tunnel. to a mountain.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{because the museum displays 10,000 relics at any given moment. but there are 60 times that many, stored in the mountain.}
<A>__{this overwhelms. even mac.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{which is why it's guarded. by an army.}
<A>__{she is unfastening the small pack at her feet...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the train shuttles relics to and from storage. it looks exactly like that.}
<A>__{so mac looks down the line. at the train car.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i've been down the air ducts four times. the train always has two armed guards. always travels between 32 and 36 miles per hour. relics don't like to be jostled too much.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{your model has five vents.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{we go down the first. back up the third, if you're lucky. if not, we have to get out by the fourth.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{then we will.}
<A>__{she pulls from the pack four thick discs, each about eight inches in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop. she starts to put two of them on...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{electromagnets, incredibly powerful. this switch is on off.}
<A>__{he gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{seems like overkill. for one simple jump.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{well, it's an eight billion dollar jump. you miss the train...you've missed the train.}
<A>__{flicks on her remote. down the track the engine revs. like crazy.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{we've got five days to grab the bones, trade them for the scan, and pull our 8 billion out of hong kong. once midnight passes on july 1st...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...we've missed the train, yeh. the bones? the scan?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh. have i neglected to fill in the details?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{an oversight.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{which i learned from the master. hey. wish me luck...}
<A>__{clicks the remote, the train leap5 forward, 36 mph never seemed so fast! she has a split second to leap down, the train sails beneath her, gin's feet graze the back end of the platform at the rear of the car, she swipes desperately with the magnets, can't connect, and is thrown into a roll along the side of the tracks. she's up on her knees, watching the train slam into the massive blue pads at the end of the track. she is bruised, shaken, but most of all, really worried and really pissed.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{jump sooner.}
<A>__{she pulls out the remote...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{be my fucking guest.}
<A>__{the train rockets backward, straight past where she kneels, to brake at the start of the track once more. she nods up to mac, who is strapping on his magnets. he crouches, nods, ready. and the train... ...blasts toward him, he counts, jumps, and slams onto the roof of the train, which plows into the heavy padding, flinging him twenty feet like a rag doll to land in a heap. he lies still. then blinks, surprised he's alive. hears a rich whiskey laughter down the track.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm too old for this shit!}
<A>__{and as he pulls himself up. she is staring at him, from her knees...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{know a dude named wiley coyote?}
<A>__{...with what can only be described as love.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{forget it.}
