<A>__{the family exits the church on the plaza of the town. vito shakes hands warmly with the priest.}
<L>__{interior village cottage night}
<A>__{the door is open the footsteps of a man enter the room. we follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they belong. they lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an old man. he sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered by mosquito netting.}
<B>__{view alters}
<A>__{and we realize that it is young vito looking at the man. we remember that the man is mosca, one of three men, who almost twenty years before had hunted down vito when he was a boy. with lightning speed, vito slashes through the mosquito netting with a knife. and with the movement precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.}
