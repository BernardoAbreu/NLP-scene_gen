<L>__{exterior mr bean's street. day}
<A>__{mr bean comes out of his house, ready to face the world he walks up the street, tutting slightly at a 'no parking' sign he passes. the street is totally car free except for a very visible lime green mini. a policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox. he moves on, satisfied that someone is mending their car. bean approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there. he then unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look on his face. the theme music big and dramatic begins, as do the rest of the credits. bean gaily motors on then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault. bean comes to a street full of sleeping policemen he goes at them at quite a lick and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently. bean looks a little annoyed into the back seat we now see the cause of the problem. instead of having a car radio, bean has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune. on he drives, through empty streets then jolt he's reached the glorious familiarity of central london, big ben and all but heels now in dreadful traffic. heels not happy. he looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. he takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight line checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. he 's satisfied does a 90 degree turn and shoots down the alley. it is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls. but at the end of the alley, the traffic's just as bad. bean notices he's outside harrods. there's a tail coated security guard at the 'front door. bean watches him stroll a bit down the street and takes his chance. he turns and drives straight through the double doors, into the store.}

<C>__{suit man}
<D>__{ah bean, i'm looking for a painting by van hocht. still life. circa 1670. can do?}
<A>__{bean nods. this is what bean likes to do best. the camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him... his office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings. at the end of the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on horses, classical maidens, rodins, the lot. it's like the giant storehouse at the end of 'raiders of the lost ark. bean sets off into it in his own eccentric way. he knows exactly where heels going. he climbs a ladder, like you find in a library then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners. he has now reached the sculpture area, but the painting heels looking for is on the other side. he crosses the room by using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. in front of him is the burghers of calais, a rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. he simply walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream. he then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as a slide and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing. he then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the mouths as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty eyes as finger holes. after a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs on the head of a little degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall. he then triumphantly pulls out a painting. it's the one!,}

<D>__{ah.... ahm....}
<A>__{bean realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit. the van gogh appears happily on the screen. bean and programmer both give out a sigh of relief. bean smiles and leaves quickly. but a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the van gogh slides down the screen like a water colour in the rain. the prog difficult to breathe.}

<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{good point bernie precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i'd expect from my new v.p. how can we, you ask, survive without whistler's mother our single greatest asset? well, the truth is we can't. so what am i saying? will we find her again? never this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.}
<A>__{bean looks pleased but then realises it's not a suitable emotion so nods sagely.}
<D>__{insurance? not a chance. those bastards never pay. so, surely we're bankrupt? surely your jobs are forfeit? surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? yes. yes indeed. except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. dare i say, one helluva little man. watch this.}
<A>__{everyone is totally at a loss. grierson stands and moves to the framed poster of whistler's mother on the wall. he then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame. a buzz and a click! an electric motor starts to whirrrr ... the glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of whistler's mother.}
