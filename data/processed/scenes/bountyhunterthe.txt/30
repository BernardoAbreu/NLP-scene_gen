<L>__{ext milo's apt day}
<A>__{milo tosses the duffle in the backseat. he pulls out the job sheet and inspects it. cass' cell phone number is listed. pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. he glances around and sees a pay phone across the way. pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone.}
<L>__{ext street day}
<A>__{cass, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying to be incognito. hurrying towards her car when she sees some cops exit a diner up ahead. she slips into a doorway, waiting for them to pass, when her phone rings. she checks it ("pay phone") and answers:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{jimmy?}
<A>__{split screen nope, not jimmy. milo doesn't speak. cass listens for a moment. she can hear breathing. what the fuck? an evil grin crosses milo's face. cass goes pale. milo takes a step forward. cass takes a step back. milo lunges and cass drops her phone and bolts out of frame.}
