<L>__{interior glen's room. night.}
<A>__{close on glen's from directly above. the music is tinny from the earphones, the tv sound distant and echoed. the boy is breathing deeply now, slowly and gently. then, unmistakeably, he begins to snore. very faintly, far in the background, we can hear nancy.}
<C>__{nancy }
<D>__{glen!! don't fall asleeeeeep!}
<A>__{camera pulls back and straight up as the snores merge with a weird, unsettling music cue. the boy lies sprawled, still clothed, in the middle of his bed. save for the bedside lamp, the room is dark. full wide angle from this high spot looking down at him as from the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling. the music reaches a terrifying pitch of anticipation then stops}
<B>__{abruptly.}
<A>__{there's a heartbeat's pause. then with tremendous force, two powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and grab glen around the waist! next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him down! his feet and his arms shoot up there's another hauling yank and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers down into the pit in the middle of the bed! his hands are last to go, clawing for a hold. but soon they vanish as well, dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the caved in bed and into the abyss. there's hideous screeching of music jamming in with glen's echoing screams then an unholy, sudden silence. next moment what's left of glen is vomited up from the pit of the nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and wires...streaming out and over the bed. then the pit in the bed is gone as if it were never there. drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, glen's mother bursts into the room. the women stares for one moment of horrified disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god awful scream imaginable. the cry splits the night.}
