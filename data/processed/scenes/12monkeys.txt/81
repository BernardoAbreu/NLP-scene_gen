<A>__{cole, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door. he's staring up at the sun and the sky. railly finishes bandaging his thigh.}

<D>__{i have to do something now. something i don't want to do. i'm so sorry.}

<D>__{i have a mission. it's important.}
<A>__{railly steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.}
