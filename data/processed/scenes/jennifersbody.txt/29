<L>__{interior kettle high hallway after school}
<A>__{the automated bell rings. needy slings on her backpack and hurries over to chip's locker. he's packing up a pair of drum mallets.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{no band practice today.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no anything today.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{it's surreal, right? i mean, when just one guy dies in devil's kettle, it's like time stops. and now so many people are dead, nobody knows when it's okay to start again.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i feel guilty just breathing.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{word.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{chip, i need to tell you something kind of weird. it's about jennifer.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? that was jennifer. but she didn't talk. she just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. she looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. she was all bloody.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{and then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together.}
<A>__{she shudders at the memory}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{yuck. like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{yeah, like almost that bad!}
<A>__{chip and needy ponder the grotesque image in silence.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{it was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no. it was something evil.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{you might want to talk to the school shrink, needy. i'm not saying that to be a dillhole. i'm actually kinda concerned.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{chip, i'm a national merit scholar. i don't tell whoppers and i'm not crazy.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i didn't say you were crazy. it's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. it's okay to feel...}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{discombobulated?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{yeah, you know. fucked up.}
<A>__{as they prepare to leave, colin gray approaches needy. he's a cute punk goth guy wearing black nail polish, a lip ring, and full wardrobe by hot topic.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{hi needy.}
<A>__{chip blatantly scoots closer to needy, eyeing colin suspiciously.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{oh. hi, colin.}
<C>__{colin}
<P>__{(dramatic)}
<D>__{i heard you were there last night. in the fiery trenches.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{well, i'm glad you made it out. really.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{colin walks away. chip looks jealous.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{how are you friends with colin gray? i thought colin gray only talked to the dead girls.}
<A>__{we see a group of goth girls splayed against their lockers in full regalia. one wears an accordion for no reason.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i just am. we have composition together. he's a really good writer. you know he's so dark and emotional and all.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{oh. i can relate. i'm also like that, even if i'm not all obvious about it like a poseur.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{walk me home?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{you know it.}
