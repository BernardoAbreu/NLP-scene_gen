<A>__{anita "needy" lesnicki, 17, sits on her hospital bed in pajamas. she's a plain faced girl with a haunted expression. as she stares out the window, she winds colored yarn around a pair of popsicle sticks to create a "god's eye." out a single window, we see an imposing nine foot}
<B>__{security fence.}
<A>__{next to needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor. there are letters, packages, even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{every day, i get letters. i think i get more letters than santa claus, zac efron and dr. phil combined. i'm kind of the shit.}

<D>__{grassy ass, raymundo.}
<A>__{needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform. as she slips off her pajamas, we can see a series of puffy, slash like scars on her body.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me. they tell me everything will be okay if i just accept jesus christ into my heart. i say the words, but nothing ever happens. nobody comes back. nobody gets off the cross.}

<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{like i'd really date some perverted chester with a hard on for jailbait. i might be insane, but i'm not desperate.}
<A>__{we see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys. they line the mirror, grinning at us. there's even a dick shot tucked in there. needy pulls on her threadbare uniform t shirt. it hangs down to her knees, covering her shorts.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{a lot of people ask me if i'm sorry i did it.}
<A>__{needy picks up a paper cup of colorful pills on her dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry swallows them.}
