<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space. leopold enters. he is suddenly embarrassed and doesn't know how to proceed.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{good morning. you're up early.}
<A>__{she moves to her computer on the other side of the room. leopold follows. before she can sit down, leopold pulls out her chair. she falls to the ground. he rushes to her side immediately.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm terribly sorry!!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{happens all the time...}
<A>__{she opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer. there is a pause.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles?... ah, kate? i was wondering...}
<A>__{she stops working and looks at leopold.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what it is you're working on.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh. it's my computer.}
<A>__{she resumes her work.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i see. actually i meant the work itself.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm researching the correlations between your time and the present.}
<A>__{leopold stares blankly.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm trying to get you home, leopold.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{charlie peaks in, signaling leopold, spurring him on.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's made me the man i am today.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it's quite a beautiful day, have you noticed? perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine spring afternoon.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh, i'd love to but i can't. i've got too much work to do. ask charlie though. he'll go with you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm afraid it really wouldn't be the same. it is your company i am seeking.}
<A>__{surprised, kate turns around and looks at leopold.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{oh, leopold. i'm so sorry. i can't.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i see. some other time then.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes... thank you.}
<A>__{leopold sits at the far end of the room. kate takes a moment then resumes typing. she stops and sits back in her chair. after a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh for crying out loud. would you look at this? leopold? the computer's on the blink again.}
<P>__{(she bangs harder)}
<D>__{cheap piece of equipment. i can't...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{maybe if you...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no, no, it does this all the time. just have to wait it out.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{darn.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{...perhaps it is a sign?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh, you think?}
<P>__{(she smiles at leopold)}
