<A>__{the group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in a large equipment yard. the call of the raptor is still audible as they head for the tree line. now they moan is answered from distant jungle quarters. the responses quickly multiply. to the group's dismay, they soon find themselves virtually surrounded by raptor cries both distant and near. grant looks around with amazement. it's vindication of his theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse time. responding to the growls, a herd of grazing hadrosaurs suddenly flees across the open space. then, in the distance behind the herd}

<A>__{in an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, grant leads the group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs. suddenly, all is chaos. hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the group. letting the others get ahead of him, grant looks back. much to his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs. indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd the raptors only want them. in the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other. up ahead, billy trips and falls. as he rolls the strap on his camera bag breaks. he doesn't notice it's missing until he's already back on his feet and running. amanda and paul keep close to each other. further back, grant spots billy's fallen camera back. he grabs it as he runs past. looking back, billy sees that grant now has his back...}
