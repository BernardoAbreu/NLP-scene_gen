<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(into phone, referring to a young woman's headshot)}
<D>__{ what do you mean she won't work with me? she's done nothing. she doesn't have a single credit }
<C>__{agent's voice}
<P>__{(from phone, off camera)}
<D>__{ better no credits than a taransky credit. no young actress is going to step into nicola anders' shoes and risk ending her career before it's even started.}

<A>__{the phone goes dead. viktor tries to re dial disconnected.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ damn.}
<A>__{sharp knock on his door. viktor peers through a curtain and spies an official looking man in a suit, carrying what looks to be a legal notice in his hands. viktor slips out of the back door.}
