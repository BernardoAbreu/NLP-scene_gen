<A>__{jelly's last shot strikes him right in the chest, and he goes down.}
<B>__{handsome jack}
<A>__{he sees potatoes fall and starts moving out, covering his retreat with another burst from his machine gun. jelly's car something snaps inside ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{goddamn it!}
<A>__{he takes the gun out of vitti's hand and starts firing}
<B>__{wildly. jelly}
<A>__{he sees handsome jack emerge from cover and takes him out with five quick shots.}
<B>__{handsome jack}
<A>__{he goes down firing, dead before he hits the ground.}
<B>__{scrap yard}
<A>__{it's suddenly quiet. after a long moment, jimmy rolls over and moans. jelly goes to him and starts examining his wound. jelly's car ben stands up, still holding vitti's gun. he sees handsome jack lying dead on the ground.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh my god! did i do that?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{no, doc. that one's mine. you got the chevy camaro and the side by side refrigerator freezer.}
<A>__{vitti emerges from behind the car looking red eyed but composed again and looks at ben.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it? you can give me back the gun now, doctor.}
<A>__{vitti holds out his hand. ben hesitates for a moment, then hands him the gun.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{it's okay. i wasn't really gonna whack you.}
<P>__{(off jelly's skeptical look)}
<D>__{all right, maybe i was gonna whack you, but i was real conflicted about it. progress, right?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't think i can see you anymore.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, i figured.}
<C>__{ben}
