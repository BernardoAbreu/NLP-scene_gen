<B>__{the cell}
<A>__{frank hangs back in the doorway. hub pulls up a chair, turns it backwards, and sits down very close to khalil.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ten thousand dollars.}
<A>__{frank translates. khalil pretends not to understand.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{khalil. i want to talk about the money.}
<A>__{again frank translates. and again, khalil looks blank.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes. khalil's eyes widen. hub smiles at him. at the sound of the match lighting, sweat begins to bead on khalil's forehead. hub takes his time lighting the cigarette drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. khalil unconsciously recoils in his chair.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(to frank, re: khalil)}

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you ready to talk about money?}
<A>__{frank hasn't even begun to translate before khalil begins speed rapping in arabic.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{...he says he loves america and only wanted to get away from the security services at home.}
<A>__{tears stream down khalil's face. he kneels at hub's feet.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(still translating)}
<D>__{...he says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad. his cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in brooklyn.}
