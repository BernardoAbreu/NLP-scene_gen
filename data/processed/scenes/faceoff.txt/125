<L>__{interior fbi archer's office day}
<A>__{alone castor picks up the framed photo of eve and jamie staring at it with unbridled hatred. fury rising, he crumples the frame and the photo in his clenching grip. he hurls it into other archer family memorabilia shattering more photos and souvenirs. only then does castor notice lazarro standing in the doorway. for how long he can't be sure.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{lazarro shuts the door behind him.}
<C>__{lazarro}
<D>__{we were friends once, jon, so i feel i owe it to you to tell you face to face...}

<D>__{ i don't understand...}
<A>__{castor suddenly jabs his fist into lazarro's chest. he pleads for mercy as castor pounds and pounds away at his heart until it finally seizes up. lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the ground.}

<D>__{now you understand.}
<A>__{he punches up the intercom button.}
<C>__{castor}

<D>__{and send for the paramedics. victor lazarro's having a heart attack.}
<A>__{castor fixes himself a shot of mescal. he checks his watch as if counting then kneels beside lazarro's body. the door flies open and two medics rush in. they see castor vigorously pumping lazarro's chest "applying"}
