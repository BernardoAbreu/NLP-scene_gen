<L>__{interior early mega tunnel day}
<A>__{weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much smaller worker ants. he actually loves the work. he's throwing up dirt like a bulldozer. he's so enthusiastic, he scoops up a whole ant in his shovel and tosses him aside. azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by, and a little attracted to, this turbo worker.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{hey, slow it down, big boy. you're making the rest of us look bad...how come i haven't seen you around here before?}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{i'm new...i was born yesterday.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{nobody told me digging was so much fun! you pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers }
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(ogling him)}
<D>__{mmm, yes, i see what you mean...}
<A>__{while azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has effectively stopped...clods are piling up behind weaver. a foreman comes striding down the line, furious.}
<C>__{foreman}
<D>__{what's the holdup here?!}
<A>__{weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if he's dealing with a superior officer.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{sorry, sir i was just having a little chat with my friend }
<C>__{foreman}
<P>__{(yelling at weaver)}
<D>__{who said you could have a chat? you're not a chatter, you're a digger! so shut up and dig!}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{leave him alone! he's new.}
<C>__{foreman}
<D>__{you too? well just for that, you lose your day's rations! now get back to work!}
<A>__{the foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the other workers as he goes along.}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(surprised at herself)}
<D>__{i don't know what came over me, talking back like that. i must be going crazy...}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{sorry i got you in trouble. but listen, you can share my rations.}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(flirting)}
<D>__{are you asking me out to dinner?}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{no i mean yes i mean if you don't have other plans.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{i will make myself available...listen, better watch out with the backtalk. i don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me. i'm afraid he got...downsized.}
