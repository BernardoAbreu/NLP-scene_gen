<A>__{the joker and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the southern border of gotham park. police barricades are everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for the birthday gala. horns honk in anger.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{move! can't you do something??}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{it's some kind of detour. they're backed up for blocks!}
<A>__{the joker snorts. he happens to glance into the side view mirror. what he sees there... curdles his blood.}
