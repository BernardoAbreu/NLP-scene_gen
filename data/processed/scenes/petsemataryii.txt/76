<L>__{exterior drew's house night}
<A>__{wheels spin as gus' squad car streaks off into the night. the cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside.}
<L>__{exterior pet sematary night}
<A>__{by now, nearly two dozen costumed kids have gathered at the pet sematary. in the midst of the graves, a small story telling campfire burns. a number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend that the bitter after taste doesn't bother them. clyde sits up front. at fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the group. with a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{...yeah, that old louis was one sick fuck... digging up little gage like so, maggots pouring out of that kid's eyes...}
<A>__{clyde whistles. he drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke ring. sees he still has an audience.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ellie was the only creed that lived. then one night a few months later, ellie freaks out, and she hacks up her grandparents with an axe!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{police found her licking their brains off the blade... they locked her up in a psycho ward and all she said were two words: 'pet sematary. pet sematary.'}
<A>__{clyde stares at the wide eyed kids. he grins, takes a swig of beer, and moves in for the kicker.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh yeah! almost forgot! here's the best part. two nights ago she escapes. word is, she was heading for maine. man i hope she doesn't show up out here.}
<P>__{(feigning concern)}
<D>__{shit, we wouldn't even notice her, not if she's wearing a costume. she could be one of us...}
<A>__{clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group. the kids uneasily look at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every costume. suddenly clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh my goddd!!!}
<A>__{clyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of spellbound listeners.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{it's... it's...}
<A>__{the kids are afraid to turn around, assuming clyde's rigged up some unspeakable terror... and for an instant, a look of real horror washes over clyde's face...}
<B>__{a figure}
<A>__{is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the swirling mist. a frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon. but then clyde realizes who it is.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{shit! it's drew's dad. it's fuckin' gus!}
<A>__{drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part of the punch line scare.}
