<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on marrow at the dining table. nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind him to get at the coffee. nell wears make up, badly applied, and her hair is up in a french twist.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic.}
<P>__{(veddy british)}
<D>__{pardon me. excuse me, sorry, sorry...}
<A>__{nell smiles. theo walks in the door, sees nell and marrow, nell squeezed in behind him.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{am i that bad?}
<A>__{theo is aware of marrow's curiosity and fascination with nell. there's a jealousy brewing.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{well this is a cozy breakfast.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{good morning, theo. luke.}
<A>__{luke comes in behind theo, tired looking also. he goes to the sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{after i went to bed, the second time, after the... noise... i had the best night's sleep of my life. anybody?}
<A>__{marrow slept badly, we can see it in his eyes.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{yes. i feel realy rested, too. theo?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i guess. oh, your hair! it looks good.}
<A>__{but she means exactly the opposite. marrow looks over nell's hair, but she can't stand it. luke comes over to the table, drops into a chair next to nell, digs into breakfast. theo's face turns into an artificial smile.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{your makeup too.}
<A>__{nell sits there flustered. marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite sure what to make of it, and intervenes.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{eat your breakfast, theo, then we'll get started on the tests.}
