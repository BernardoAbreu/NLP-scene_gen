<L>__{exterior yard of the edwards house full shot late afternoon}
<A>__{along the side of the house comes ben edwards, 14, with a man sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. he, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. so much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. he pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. beyond ben, martin pauley emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward camera. martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with indian straight hair and a white man's eyes. he is carrying bridle or other horse gear. he looks to the family on the porch to see if they recognize the stranger then out again. he continues, followed by ben, toward where debbie crouches over her dog.}
