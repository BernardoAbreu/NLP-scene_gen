<A>__{yes! you are! and my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. so you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! i will not be made out a fool! is this in any way unclear? rose shrinks into the chair. she sees trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice. cal follows rose's glance and straightens up. he stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{we... had a little accident. i'm sorry, trudy.}
