<A>__{rheya, on the floor, dead. her hand outstretched, a repeat of an image we saw earlier. rain streaks the kitchen window. the bottle of pills nearby.}

<L>__{interior prometheus}
<A>__{rheya is taking her pills. kelvin watches.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what do you remember?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{do you remember beethoven? the beatles? movies, books, restaurants, friends?}
<C>__{rheya}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{yes. but not until you mentioned them. as soon as you said those things, i remembered them. and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember. it's like filling up.}
<A>__{she looks out the portal at solaris.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{is it a planet?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{not exactly. it exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe. an infinite number of them, in fact. it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe, space, or space time. it was completely counter intuitive. we had to unlearn everything.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{is it intelligent?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{intelligent beyond our comprehension.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{then it's god, right?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{it's something.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you still don't believe in god?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man. even the limits we put on it are human limits. it can do this, it can do that! it designs, it creates!}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{even a god that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{you're talking about a man in a white beard again. you're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. human beings look for causes and patterns. how could we know what solaris is up to, if anything?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{as i said, then it's god, right?}
<A>__{she looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{why are we talking about this shit when we could be fucking?}
<A>__{kelvin smiles. the intercom comes to life.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{kelvin, you awake?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{just a little strategy session. but in person this time.}
