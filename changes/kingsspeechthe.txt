A head emerges. White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels.}

<ACTION>__{The ritual continues with crisp military precision. CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp, thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown. This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white shirt. Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted. Mirror-polished boots are laced tight. Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received. Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions. Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted. Polished buttons are fastened. Multi-coloured collar clasped shut. White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair. PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked. Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:}

Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos. Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave. Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and four, wave back from their nursery window.}

For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D) But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.}
