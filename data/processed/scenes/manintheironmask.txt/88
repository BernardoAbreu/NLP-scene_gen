<A>__{light falls on athos' face; it is dawn. he hears the whinny of horses, and looks out the window to see a carriage about to leave. reacting quickly, he hurries out quietly.}

<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what you're asking is impossible!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i offer you the perfect revolution. a revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the king.}

<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you said you'd do anything, athos, anything to replace this king. so do it.}
<A>__{aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives the horses away. athos, wide eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away. he turns back toward the house, and see's phillippe looking out the window without the mask.}
