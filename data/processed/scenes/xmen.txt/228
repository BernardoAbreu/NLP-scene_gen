<L>__{interior statue head night}
<A>__{wham e.c.u. sabretoothis feet as he lands on the metal floor. he quickly takes in the situation, magneto and rogue are still unconscious. he walks towards storm. the air in the room starts to crackle and sabretoothis hair begins to stand on end as it did when these two last confronted each other.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{i donit think so.}
<A>__{sabretooth backhands storm across the jaw, knocking her out. as her head drops, he draws his claws and slashes it down. it stops, just before tearing open storm's throat, held by an unseen force. he turns and sees that jean has focused her power in his arm. he smiles. he walks to jean and tears off her bonds. he reaches out to grab her neck but his claw is stopped again in mid air. sabretooth just smiles wider and forces his hand forward. the outcome never really in doubt, the claw wraps around jean's neck. she begins to choke.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{jean!}
<A>__{sabretooth lifts jean by the neck and walks away from cyclops as he chokes her.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{sorry about this sweetheart, but i made logan a promise.}
<A>__{jean struggles desperately against sabretoothis unbreakable grip, the life draining from her. then }
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{hey, ya big pussy.}
<A>__{sabretooth whips around, still clutching jean to see logan bleeding, beaten and panting, and yet still standing defiantly over magnetois unconscious body.}
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{i ainit finished with you yet.}
<A>__{sabretooth looks at him, disbelieving that this man can still be standing, let alone challenging him... and he starts to laugh.}
<C>__{sabretooth}
<D>__{you?}
<A>__{logan grins.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{not just me.}
<A>__{and with that: he extends one claw from his right hand, squats down, and cuts the piece of metal holding cyclopsi visor to magnetois belt. he lifts it up and it slides down his claw to his hand. he casually throws it in the air.}
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{jean?}
<A>__{logan looks at the visor and it freezes in the air. it flies across the room, right past sabretoothis head. he lunges at it with his free claw but just misses it. the visor lands square on cyclopsi eyes, and attaches itself to cyclopsi face. he turns. boom! a focused optic blast hits sabretooth like a freight train. he drops jean and slams through the wall.}
