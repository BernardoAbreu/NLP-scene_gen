<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{come back! martin!}
<A>__{he guns the engine as soon as he's clear. hendricks gives his jacket to a suddenly chilled ellen, and hails the cabin cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding its horn. ellen stares after the receding boat.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{my purse is on that boat.}
