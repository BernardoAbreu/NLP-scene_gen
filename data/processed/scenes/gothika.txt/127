<L>__{interior miranda's new cell}
<A>__{white. surveillance cameras in every corner. two separate doors with elaborate locks. high security all around. the officers undo miranda's cuffs and excuse themselves. pete gestures for irene and the orderlies to leave as well.}
<D>__{orderly #1 we'll be right outside, doctor.}
<A>__{once the doors are locked and they're alone, the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back. the best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here. five. under my }

<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{peter, i didn't believe in ghosts before this. and neither do you.}
<A>__{pete is at the end of his rope. can't hide his sadness when he looks at her. still, he tries to get her back on track:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{but you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. the simplest chemical deficiencies can }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{chemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm a very open minded person, but as a doctor }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're a close minded academic, just like me. you told me once that i was the most logical person you knew, remember? well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. rachel parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago tossed off the ashley bridge by my husband. my harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband that's how pathetically blind i've been.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{andrea white and jenny dixon were also abducted and murdered now this was before i met doug but i bet you anything that they both went to his school. then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions namely me delayed him from reverting to his sickness. that's why i didn't notice anything. i believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. then along comes tracy seaver and he can't resist. locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property }
<A>__{she shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{here's doug's interest in real estate, pete.}
<A>__{pete stares at the realty listing for willows creek.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{rachel parsons is a pissed off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem. made sure i killed doug because he was going to do the same thing to tracy seaver as he did to her. and she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way.}
<A>__{pete takes all of this in. dumbfounded.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{is that a threat?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{to whom?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{to me.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{to you? i'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when i tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if i don't do what she wants she's going to kill me.}
<A>__{pete can see that she's petrified. he starts to speak, but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips. the gesture is tender, almost romantic. a reminder of their very real connection.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i need you to at least consider the possibility that i'm not insane.}
<P>__{(beat; pleading)}
<D>__{not as a doctor. as the only person i trust in this world.}
