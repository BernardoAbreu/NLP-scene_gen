<A>__{thick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. close on miguel staring out the bus window. on his way home, he passes... half clothed children flying a homemade kite. a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top. an old man sitting by the street, looking straight at miguel. flaming sugarcane alongside the road. three children wedged between their parents on a motorbike. the tall, wheezing smokestack of the cristobal colon sugar refinery.}
