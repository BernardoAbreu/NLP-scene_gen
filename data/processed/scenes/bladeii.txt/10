<A>__{ rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them two bmw r1200 motorbikes and a tricked out panhead harley chopper with ape hanger handlebars. rush and segura leap atop their bmws. jigsaw rolls into a puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his chopper. as the vamps peel out }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{bursts from the factory. segura revs his bmw, trying to run him down. at the last second, blade pivots aside like a matador. segura circles around for another try. blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the back of the bike behind segura. shinggg! blade pulls a retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and wraps it around segura's throat. with a violent twist, blade decapitates segura. as the vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, blade leans forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle. whoosh! blade speeds after the other vamps.}
