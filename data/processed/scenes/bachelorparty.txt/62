<A>__{she gestures to a man with his back to us.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{let's talk.}
<A>__{the pimp turns around and we see he is the stereotypical pimp. one big difference: he's an indian straight from the streets of calcutta. he's soft spoken and ever smiling and he still hasn't quite mastered english.}
<C>__{rajah}
<P>__{(oh so heavy indian accent)}
<D>__{what can i be doing for you?}
<C>__{gary}

<C>__{rajah}
<D>__{this being milt.}
<A>__{milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his face through a nearby window, smashing it to pieces. he pulls his head out, smiles and puts his hat back on.}
