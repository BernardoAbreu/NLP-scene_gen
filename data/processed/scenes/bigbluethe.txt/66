<T>__{time dissolve to later:}
<B>__{jacques and enzo}
<A>__{there are now several empty champagne bottles around. they are both quite drunk. enzo is philosophizing. johana is looking for them.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{... so, between mamma, roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long. except with angelica. she just cries. and then finally, we all end up kissing. can you explain that to me?}
<A>__{jacques can't answer.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{because that's what love is all about. it's a pain in the ass but keeps us together.}
<P>__{(then, in a half}
<D>__{dreaming, half}
<P>__{desperate tone)}
<D>__{a large and beautiful family!}
<A>__{johana walks over to them.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{enzo... we must quit the competition.}
<A>__{enzo hits a wrong note on the piano.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{if we don't... i'm going to beat you.}
<A>__{johana stands next to jacques.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(with a nervous laugh)}
<D>__{huh? well listen to him!}
<P>__{(to johana)}
<D>__{do you hear that?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{he looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "i'm going to beat you".}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{... that's what he's here for, isn't he?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{listen to her! "that's what he's here for"! he's here to loose, that's what he's here for. first of all, i'm unbeatable. second, how old are you?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{two years younger than you.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{as i said, second of all you're too skinny. you've got tiny lungs. i still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{look at me. these aren't lungs. these are... tanks. how long can you hold your breath?}
<A>__{enzo is getting really angry. the drinks have a lot to do with it.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{i don't know. longer than you.}
<A>__{enzo pulls open his collar and rises.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{we'll see.}
