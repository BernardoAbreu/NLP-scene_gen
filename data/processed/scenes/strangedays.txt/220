<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{down below, in the madness of the crowd, we move with spreg as he searches for mace. he sees her from behind, walking near one of the stages. he moves up behind her, aiming his pistol at the back of her head. she turns and... ... it isn't mace. another girl in a similar dress. spreg curses and looks around. engelman catches a glimpse of mace running. he points to her position and spreg charges after her. he has his baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people out of the way as he runs. mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people out of her way. strobe lights from the stage and flashes from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look. spreg fires at her. people drop, their screams drowned out by the pandemonium. the gunshots don't register above the concussions from the fireworks. no one notices the shootings. spreg continues to fire, missing her as people block his shots. mace won't fire back in the crowd. on spreg, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting tower. he has lost sight of her. he starts to reload his pistol. mace comes up to him silently from behind the tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt of her pistol. spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across her forearm. her .380 clatters to the ground. mace bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her palm up under his chin. his head raps off the metal. mace is like a she panther. she rips the baton out of his hands and cracks him once across the windpipe. he drops to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe. a shot hits the metal space frame next to her head. she spins to see engelman, charging toward her. before he can fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping spreg, using him as a human wall. she clamps an arm around his neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt. she shoots engelman in the chest from 8 feet. he convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping like a fish. she holds the current on him while she goes over and kicks his gun away. she takes engelman's cuffs from his belt. spreg glares at her through the blood running into his eyes. she raises the baton.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{all the way down! right now!!}
<A>__{he slowly drops to the pavement, face down. now that she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one of spreg's hands to one of engelman's. the crowd of partiers stares. can't believe what they're seeing. mace takes spreg's cuffs and attaches his other wrist to the base of the tower. that's when three lapd cops in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and see a black girl crouching over two of la's finest with a police baton. the cops advance toward her.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{wait. let me tell you what's going on here }
<A>__{the nearest shoots her with a tazer. she spasms and goes to her hands and knees. one of the cops kicks her down. she cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the breath as the batons start to fall. the crowd around them watches fascinated, gasping. mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff spreg.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no!! no!!!}
<A>__{they crack her with their batons, telling her to stay down. another one kicks her in the stomach. a black kid in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking cops. and then they come out of the crowd... one, then three, then half a dozen. just normal people... black, white, latino people... that can't watch this happen any more. they jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down. it becomes a brawl. then cops are running in from everywhere. we see the trigger point of a full scale riot. cops in full riot gear, with lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a space. a helicopter xenon comes straight down from above, like the divine light of god. mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up. within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on the way, forming a human wall. they get the crowd settled down. through the phalanx of riot cops comes palmer strickland and several ranking officers. he surveys the scene. strickland looks down at mace and then at spreg and engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still handcuffed to each other and the steel tower. the beat extends... strickland unreadable, face stern as moses. then... he points at the two prone cops.}
<C>__{strickland}
<P>__{(to the nearest officers)}
<D>__{these two are under arrest for murder.}
<A>__{strickland looks spreg in the eye and holds up lenny's squid tape. spreg and engelman react, knowing they are over. the helicopter xenon gives the whole moment an otherworldly quality. like they are in some celestial court of judgment.}
<C>__{strickland}
<D>__{get some medical attention for this woman.}
<A>__{lenny pushes through from behind strickland. he runs to mace and kneels next to her.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{a trickle of blood runs down her face. she nods weakly and reaches for him. they hug, then they both wince in pain. mace sees the cops running in to arrest spreg and engelman. one of them unhooks spreg from the tower.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i got 'em, lenny.}
<A>__{engelman lunges, grabbing a gun from the holster of the closest cop. he waves them back with it. then puts it in his mouth and fires. he topples against spreg, spraying him with his spurting blood. spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground, bathing in his blood. you see him going insane, right at that moment. his face is suddenly demonic. spreg, the street monster cop, rises in slow motion. his glare is fixed on lenny and mace. he has engelman's gun in one blood drenched hand. lifting the dead weight of engelman by the handcuff, he begins to drag the body, lurching toward mace. he keeps the pistol down along his side. spreg exists at the center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do. he has a gun so they can't rush him. but he's a cop, so they can't shoot him. several officers shout at him to drop the weapon. you barely hear them over the pandemonium of the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{shoot!}
<A>__{like a scene from a nightmare the blood drenched spreg, completely unhinged, lurches toward them. engelman's body slides over the ground, leaving a snail track of blood a foot wide.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{you fucking nigger bitch!!}
<A>__{he raises engelman's pistol, points it at her and... lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take the fire, and... pow pow pow! the lapd executes spreg in a hail of fire. he drops like a sack of cement. the smoke clears. lenny blinks... realizing he is alive. he faints. mace shakes him, thinking he is shot. he opens his eyes.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, what?}
