<B>__{parker and madison}
<A>__{reach the top of the stairs. sid 6.7 remains on the phone, his back toward parker and madison. they split up, winding their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus. as the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move toward the opening doors. obscuring parker's view of the payphone. parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see sid 6.7 holding madison in front of him, his gun to her head. parker trains his weapon at sid 6.7. he doesn't have a clean shot.}

<D>__{hey, sid, what were you planning on doing with the c 4?}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{he rushes to cox. parker drops to his knees, cradling cox's head. cox isn't long for this earth. looking up to parker, he tries to talk. but nothing comes out.}

<P>__{(compassionately)}
<D>__{don't worry, i know. i know.}
<A>__{cox's eyes roll back in his head. parker then closes them and gently lays his head on the sidewalk. parker turns his head toward sid 6.7, who's released madison and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below. parker rushes to the railing.}

<D>__{i have to tell you, i do enjoy you, parker. i really don't want to have to kill you...}
