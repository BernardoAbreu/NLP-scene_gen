<L>__{interior exterior packing house morning}
<A>__{homer and wally walk through the packing house, where the hefty, loud women sort through the apples rolling by on the conveyor tracks. wally snatches an apple from one of them, giving it to homer.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{you getting along okay?}
<A>__{before homer can answer, the women interrupt.}
<C>__{big dot}
<D>__{where is that candy?}
<C>__{florence}
<D>__{did she leave you, wally?}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{who's the boy?}
<A>__{wally makes an effort to introduce homer, but he's interrupted.}
<C>__{florence}
<D>__{wally, you can marry debra if candy leaves you!}
<C>__{big dot}
<D>__{wally's gonna marry me if candy leaves him!}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{you can marry all three of us, wally!}
<C>__{florence}
<D>__{we can take turns.}
<A>__{wally puts his hand to his heart.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{you girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war.}
<P>__{(points to homer)}
<D>__{but i will leave my best man here to pinch hit for me.}
<A>__{as the women are left behind giggling, wally continues talking to homer.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{uh... i'm shipping out sooner than i thought. i just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough, considering...}
<P>__{(grabbing another apple from a crate)}
<D>__{are you bored stiff? or can you stick it out for a bit?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while. i'm grateful for the job.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(his hand on homer's shoulder)}
<D>__{you're the one who's helping me, homer. you're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i'm gone. candy, too.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{well, sure... that's good, then.}
<P>__{(awkward pause)}
<D>__{all i mean is, i'm lucky i met you.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i don't think so, homer. i'm the lucky one.}
<A>__{homer shakes his head. wally stops walking; they both stop.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(more serious)}
<D>__{you want to fight about it?}
<A>__{homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at first he is startled, but then he laughs. wally laughs, too. they shake hands. mr. rose calls out to homer from the tractor. the pickers are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going back to the orchard. homer has to run to catch up to them. he jumps on the flatbed; he sees wally waving good bye.}
