<L>__{exterior the killing ground, cold mountain. dusk}
<A>__{inman approaches the killing ground. he studies the ground, finds pangle's grave. blood has left its black writing in the snow and he finds first where stobrod has been, where the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. he puts his hand into the ashes of ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. it's getting dark. he takes a drink from the stream, shudders at the cold.}
