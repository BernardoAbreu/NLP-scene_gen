<L>__{exterior bishop's house. night}
<A>__{a thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its trunk. for some reason, it remains standing. mr. bishop sits on the ground leaning against it. he breathes heavily. the axe rests across his lap. a twig snaps. mr. bishop looks up, listening. pause. he drinks a sip of wine. in the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into the trees on the left. a moment later, one taller silhouette rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees on the right.}
