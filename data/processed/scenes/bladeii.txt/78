<A>__{scud unloads his handgun into the reaper atop the van. the reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't! scud flees, diving into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel. he keys the ignition wham! now the reaper is atop the hood, smashing his feet through the windshield. scud screams as he slams the van into the drive and floors the pedal wk krunch! scud crashes the van against the side of a building, pinning the reaper between the van's front bumper and the crumbling wall. he keeps his foot on the gas pedal, grinding the van's wheels. this gambit should cut the reaper in half, or at the very least, fatally wound it but it only enrages it further. the reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood and resumes battering away at the cracked windshield }
