<L>__{exterior cannery warehouse district night}
<A>__{as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group of dock warehouses and alleys.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{there must be a phone around here somewhere.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, mr. robertson.}
<A>__{sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper. predator's point of view same time we're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as they come in our direction. waiting for the right moment.}
<B>__{return to shot}
<A>__{as they move towards the stack of crates. without warning, a pair of gang bangers jump out, both holding guns. nervous young druggies.}
<D>__{gang ranger #1 hands up!! gang banger #2 do it!!}
<A>__{all hands go up. gang banger #2 grabs mcculloch's watch and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit cards while #1 keeps them covered.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 got some good shit here, holmes. gang banger #1}
<P>__{(eyeing rennie)}
<D>__{you got that right...}
<A>__{he steps over to rennie, brushing her hair back with the barrel of his revolver, spotting the statue of liberty pendant sean gave her.}
<D>__{gang banger #l now ain't that sweet.}
<A>__{he tears it off her neck, pocketing it. sean angrily moves toward him and gang banger #l shoves the barrel against rennie's temple.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 go ahead, superman. be a hero.}
<A>__{sean has no choice but to freeze. julius flexes his fists, but he too has gang banger #2's gun leveled on him. mcculloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. it doesn't go unnoticed.}
<D>__{gang banger #l you got a problem, dad?}
<A>__{mcculloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the gun toting kid. rennie's dog begins to growl, backing away, ready to defend her. gang banger #1 points his barrel at toby with zero conscience, cocking back the hammer.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet}
<B>__{fires...}
<A>__{angle toby as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. toby sprints off into the darkness.}
<B>__{return to shot}
<A>__{gang banger #1 grabs rennie by the hair, brutally jerking her head back.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{please, don't hurt her... gang banger #l hurt this princess?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{would i do that?}
<A>__{they cough out laughs. gang banger #1 looks into rennie's eyes, his barrel still on her skin.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 you look like a party girl, princess. how'd you like to go on a date with me and my friend? if you're free, that is.}
<A>__{more phlegm filled laughs. he drags her away, gang banger #2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on the others.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 you follow and we'll blow her fuckin' head off, comprende?}
<A>__{the others watch helplessly as rennie is abducted.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{we can't let those gang bangers get away, man...}
<A>__{julius starts to move after them. mcculloch grabs him.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you heard him! we have to call the police}
<A>__{julius jerks away from mcculloch's grasp. but he knows mcculloch is right.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{everyone split up we'll cover more ground that way.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{i don't think that's such a safe idea}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{my niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! every second counts.}
<A>__{no more rebuttal. they hurry off.}
