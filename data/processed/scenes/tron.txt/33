<A>__{alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass window through which the laser laboratory is visible. a sign over the window, marked "experiment in progress," is illuminated by a red warning bulb.}
<L>__{interior laser room long shot}
<A>__{of two white suited figures visible through a network of two white suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that encloses the giant laser structure. they are standing on a cherry picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of tools at their feet. we truck down the side of the laser, along the tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and move up, gradually getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look at them. we see that the figures are a young, dark haired, beautiful woman, with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard hat. the woman is lora and the man is dr. walter gibbs. he's wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch calculator, and has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their bristling white eyebrows. in contrast, lora seems more serious and conservative, but she defers to gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist. both have protective eye goggles worn loosely around their necks at the moment. as the crane lowers them to the floor:}

<D>__{well, here goes nothing ...}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{hah. interesting, interesting. you hear what you said? "here goes nothing."}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{well, i meant }
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{whereas actually, what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again. so you might just as well have said, "here goes something and here comes nothing." hah?}
<A>__{they step off the crane and walk to a short, lead shielded cylindrical platform, on which rests a solid sphere of clear plastic polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. the "firing" end of the giant laser is aimed straight at the sphere. five feet away is an identical plat form empty.}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{let me make sure we're running}
<A>__{she crosses to a computer console nearby. the console is connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables. pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the console. gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near the platform bearing the sphere safe from the laser, but close enough to watch. angle lora she types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{looks good...}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{let 'er rip...}
<A>__{laser lab as before the laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright light at the polymer sphere. for a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly received television picture wobbling lines of dots and then it disappears entirely. as gibbs watches, a lora works feverishly, the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. a second discharge of light hits the surface of this platform, and like a film in reverse of the ball's disappearance it is reconstructed, five feet from its original position. when the beam shuts off, lora rushes to join gibbs in examining the born again ball of plastic.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{at the sound o.s. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, lora and a gibbs turn to see alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper shoe covers, walking toward them.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{beautiful!}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{hello, alan.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{boy, i sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.}
<A>__{he gives lora an embrace and a quick kiss.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{not disintegrating, alan digitizing. while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...}
<P>__{(indicates ball)}
<D>__{voila.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{great. can it send me to hawaii?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. hah!}
<A>__{the three start walking out of the laser lab, alan and lora with their arms around each other's shoulders.}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{how's it going upstairs?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{frustrating. i had tron almost ready to run, and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system.}
<A>__{gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ever since he got that master control program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{well, you have to expect some static. computers are just machines after all, they can't think...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{they'll start to soon enough.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{yes, won't that be grand the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. lora, i'm going to stay and run some data through. see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{ad lib goodnights.}
