<A>__{l.a. joan's voice gets louder.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{my wire's been in the hospital so things might be a little dusty, but the sheets are clean and the bath's down the hall.}
<P>__{(looks at kenny's violin case)}
<D>__{you're in music, i guess, aren't you? 'cause my niece sings most of the day. that won't bother you, will it?}
<A>__{kenny starts to answer.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{i didn't think it would. she's calling herself l.a. joan this week. last week it was dakota. guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.}

<D>__{she sure sings nice.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{my wife and i think so, but we're family. your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. what do you do, pick or sing?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{oh... a little of both. just thought i'd look around at nashville for a while.}

<C>__{green}
<D>__{when you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at bishop's pub. they let you pass the hat. all these kids do that. most every place doesn't want to bother with you.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i'm not really a musician.}
<A>__{green smiles.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{well, don't be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.}
<C>__{kenny}

<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{listen, do you know anything about cars?}
