<A>__{the red carpet unrolls all the way to the rolls, rear door. close on the bottom of the driver's door. it opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing army boots and khaki trousers. the legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. camera pans up to show us that governor reynolds is dressed in his veteran's uniform chest of medals and forage cap. he is a grand figure. in fact he's exactly the same grand figure mr bean caused epic problems to on the plane over. he gives his prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on. brutus and his side kick cop fall into step behind him. they are the police presence today. grierson and bernie greet reynolds at the entrance. grierson is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit. bernie is frowning not happy about that uniform.}

<D>__{yes it is ... may i introduce you to bern ...}
<A>__{he gestures to bernie but reynolds cuts in and hands bernie a set of car keys.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<P>__{(to bernie)}
<D>__{go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.}
<A>__{bernie's smile melts away. as they enter the gallery, bernie hopefully offers the car keys to brutus who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and follows the governor. bean (wearing "dr bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door, thus just missing reynolds. bernie sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{bean go park the governor's car, will you.}
<A>__{bean assents happily. brutus spies bean over his shoulder and frowns its that mad english guy again. bean gets to the door and sees the governor's car. yummy!}
