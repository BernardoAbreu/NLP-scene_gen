<C>__{larry}
<D>__{when was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking?}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{actually, we had lunch together last week.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and before that?}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{it's been about seven years.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{seven years? that's a joke, right? that's like two olympics. and i'm the bad guy. what debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. and it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. i'm sure oliver would agree.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{are you really doing this right now?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{am i doing what? i didn't start the toast.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{are you really about to hit up my dad for money?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what? he does four operations a day. it's perfect. it helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you can't buy forgiveness, right pete?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't think anyone's looking for handouts... we'd pay him back.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{if you two are in a bind i'd be more than happy to help.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no. it's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment, remember?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what do you want me to do? admit that my life is shit? is that what you want me to say? you happy? aren't i allowed a little joy with these children i never wanted to have?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you have never once stopped asking us for money.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{family helps family.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's true. family helps family. look, i don't expect you to fully understand. your dad left. you're broken inside. it's not your fault you can't feel love. there's something that you can't this is coming out wrong.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you know what? i would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. you know the best quality my father has? he asks for nothing. i don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. look at that. nothing. i don't even know him. and i turned out perfectly fine without his input.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i just figured out what your problem is. you hate jews. which is so odd because your children are jewish.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{don't play the jew card, larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm not playing any jew card.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{seriously, it's used up.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you can't use up a jew card. that's the whole point of a jew card.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{that's right. you can't use it up, it goes forever.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{you know what? i have to go.}
<A>__{oliver gets up to leave.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{great. what a big surprise. bye oliver. see you later. see you in another seven years. make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today. you know, nothing i do is right because of you? nothing. no matter how hard i try, i'm just the asshole here, but you know what i realized? it's you. you're the asshole.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{good luck working that out. happy birthday and go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{oliver walks out.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{see you when the cubs win the pennant.}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{i'm going to light the candles. get it going.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{maybe we should try the toast again.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{can you be quiet?}
<P>__{(to pete)}
<D>__{you just threw me under the bus.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no. we agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm not ripping into your dad. i'm just saying to him what you say to me.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't be such a ball buster.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i am not a ball buster. you make me one! i am a fun girl! i am fun loving! i am a good time sally! i dance hip hop. i cannot believe i've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls. i am the only one here who has any balls.}
