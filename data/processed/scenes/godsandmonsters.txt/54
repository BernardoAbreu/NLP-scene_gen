<A>__{it's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from "bride of frankenstein." whale sits in a massive chair, straining against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages outside. in the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer, until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the monster. whale hardly dares to breathe as the monster rips off the door and enters the cell. the monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his face for the first time. it is clay boone, dressed in a marine parade uniform. he uses his hedge clippers to cut the chains from around whale's chest.}
