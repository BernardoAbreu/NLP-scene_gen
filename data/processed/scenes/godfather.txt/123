<L>__{ext day: connie's street}
<A>__{carlo settles down on the front steps of the 112th st. "book" with sally rags and coach, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner. the ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball. carlo has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store. the tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a man comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed. it is a moment before we recognize that it is sonny. his face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has carlo by the throat. he pulls carlo away from the others, trying to get him down into the street. but carlo reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. his shirt is ripped away in sonny's hand. sally rags and coach, merely sit, watching, stunned. sonny is pounding the cowered carlo with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. his blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood. the kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination. carlo's hands are clenched tight around the railing. sonny beats him mercilessly. now sonny's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators. sonny's tight fists are going down like hammers, into carlo's face and body. carlo's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing. sonny grabs hold of carlo's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort. then he tries loosening carlo's locked hands; even biting them. carlo screams but he does not let go. it's clear that carlo is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved. sonny knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted. totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding carlo.}

<A>__{he wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. we notice one man with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested. carlo finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. he slumps onto the stoop. fade out: }
