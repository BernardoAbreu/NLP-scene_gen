<A>__{jim tries to smile and seem attentive, but we sense his profound fatigue and his profound sadness.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{and on halloween we could have a haunted house. but a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones. you know, more like the radio station ones. this one would be really scary. and for homecoming well, you know how last year's theme was }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{paul... paul.... we'll have plenty of time to get into all this later. a whole year, in fact. right now i just need to finish my pie and get home.}
