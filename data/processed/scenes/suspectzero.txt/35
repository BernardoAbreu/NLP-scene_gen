<A>__{harold speck lies on a table. a bespectacled coroner examines him. victim #2, barney fulcher, lies on another, his ample frame yet to be examined. the lights are out, but that coroner wears a fluorescent halo, with a microphone pinned to his gown. he speaks into it with a quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc. mackelway and fran are here... watching. mackelway is particularly focused on fulcher's face. his eyelids, we now see, have also been torn off. hmmmm...}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{why eyelids?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{no other signs of torture here. why take somebody's eyelids off?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{so they can't blink.}
<A>__{she sighs, aloud: "i know that already, asshole." coroner keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{it's a metaphor to make certain the victim sees... or to make certain that we see something.}
<P>__{(she's silent)}
<D>__{or maybe it's just a fuck you.}
<A>__{coroner continues his monotone narration... then crosses to the sink. that puts him out of earshot. so:}
<C>__{mackelway }
<P>__{(to fran, quietly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry about don.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{you're not wearing your ring anymore.}
<A>__{that was an attempt at kindness. she knows that. still, she eyes her left hand, self consciously, while mackelway loses himself in those lidless eyes of fulcher's... then there's a knock at the glass window behind them. they turn. charlton stands on the other side of a glass window, in a viewing room adjacent to this morgue. he presses a piece of paper up against the glass. on it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: "matches one of one." below that we see that circle with the slash through it. this is a fax, which charlton's just received. he points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map. the ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. those scrawled lines take us to "the hope house," in oklahoma city. at the bottom a scribbled name, "david dyson," and a contact number. moving closer to the glass, mackelway nods. he just got a break...}
