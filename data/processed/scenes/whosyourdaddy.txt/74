<L>__{interior school gymnasium night}
<A>__{prom night. couples slow dance to a marilyn manson clone, singing a rock version of "precious and few." principal merkin watches on the sidelines. surprisingly calm. suspiciously happy. ted caresses ginger's bare back as they dance together. his head nestled against her breasts. not a care in the world. he spots charlie on the dance floor. making out with one of his dates, the identical taylor triplets, while the other two patiently wait their turn.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{teddy? i was thinking.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hmmm?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{after graduation...maybe we could go away together?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{whatever you want.}
<A>__{we notice christy malone dancing with her football captain date. the perfect male specimen. christy gives ted a disappointed, longing gaze. but he's oblivious.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i bet st. tropez in july would be paradise. for a honeymoon.}
<A>__{suddenly a flash blinds them. it's julie conroy, doing her job. following her subject.}
<C>__{ginger }
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{you could have warned us.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oops, sorry. warning: you've got lipstick on your teeth.}
<A>__{julie flashes the camera again. capturing ginger's panicked expression. we notice that julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown. not so glamorous as ginger, but far more appealing and natural.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wow...you clean up nice.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{put your eyeballs back in your head, william randolph. i'm on assignment. a girl has to fit in.}
<A>__{ginger seems testy and jealous. her true colors emerging.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{teddy, i thought we were having a moment here.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{of course we were.}
<A>__{suddenly the music dies. everyone turns to the stage where principal merkin stands proudly. holding a power cord.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{i apologize for interrupting the festivities, but i have some good news. i've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools. and it seems quite clear...}
<P>__{(reading from manual)}
<D>__{"minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians."}
<A>__{a spotlight suddenly finds ted and charlie's beautiful dates.}
<C>__{principal merkin }
<D>__{so long, ladies. prom's over.}
<A>__{the crowd boos, hisses.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{honestly, merk. it's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{rules are rules.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{come on, it's our only senior prom.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{deaf ears, mr. nelson. i answer to a higher power.}
<A>__{charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{here's the deal, merk. forget the "rules and regulations" malarkey and we'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the taylor triplets.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{out! now!}
<A>__{ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake. he steps up on stage. approaches principal merkin. takes out his wallet.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's your price, merk? how much will it cost to make you go bye bye?}
<A>__{the crowd cheers.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{you're crossing the line, mr. nelson.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a statue in front of city hall, dedicated to principal dick merkin?}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{i'm warning you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a new pediatric wing at the hospital? a presidential campaign? name it. anything.}
<A>__{principal merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it. yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. he has to maintain his dignity...}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{that's it! you're out of here!}
<A>__{from nowhere, a flock of beefy security guards emerge to remove ted & co.}
<C>__{principal merkin }
<D>__{good bye, mr. nelson. have a pleasant evening.}
<A>__{the marilyn manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and replaced by six geezers in powder blue tuxedoes. as security guards carry them away...}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{ted! do something!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(restrained)}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{this is humiliating. we're being ejected from a prom!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hang in there, i will think of something.}
<A>__{as they reach the doors...}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i guess...i don't know...i guess we should leave if we're not wanted.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i hear you, bro. we're angus men in a ground round town.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{this is what i get for playing den mother in "romper room." take me to the airport, charlie!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{why don't you just hitch a ride on the horse you rode in on?}
<A>__{ginger storms away in an angry huff.}
<C>__{charlie }
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{don't forget your broom!}
<A>__{ted experiences a moment of loss.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i thought i loved her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{chicks are like buses. if you miss one, don't sweat it. there's another coming 'round the corner.}
<A>__{one of the taylor triplets bats her lashes at ted.}
<C>__{charlie }
<P>__{(whispering to ted)}
<D>__{take your pick. they're identical.}
<A>__{ted grins broadly. he turns and shouts to his classmates...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{everybody, listen up! this prom sucks! let's party at my place!}
<A>__{responses are mixed. some cheer, some are undecided. until the new band starts playing, "tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree." and everyone rushes for the exit, following ted.}
