<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior inside the roman theater meanwhile}
<A>__{the gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum like staircase. behind them we can see the tour group, standing on the stage, being lectured to by the ancient geezer. in front of them the gunmen find an exit which leads to an interior hall. inside the exit it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the gunmen. they look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice come at them from out of the dark.}
<C>__{gregor }
<D>__{thank you, gentleman, that will do nicely.}
<A>__{in the hall on gregor. it's dark in here. there are no lights, no torches. from the dark in here, he can look out and see the gunmen, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by the sun. now we cut back and forth : between these two angles, and it becomes clear that gregor has chosen wisely he can see his quarry, but they can't see him.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{edvard, is that you?}
<A>__{edvard, the more dangerous looking of the two gunmen responds.}
<C>__{edvard}
<D>__{yes, gregor, they sent me.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. it's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.}
<C>__{edvard}
<D>__{that was a mistake, trying to kill you. mikhi did it without consulting me, i'd have never allowed it.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i'm sure. but i'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.}
<C>__{edvard}
<D>__{we'll double your price.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(now that's interesting)}
<D>__{really? do you have the money with you?}
<C>__{edvard}
<D>__{do you have the material?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{you first, edvard.}
<C>__{edvard}
<D>__{perhaps we could both go at the same time...}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(a short laugh)}
<D>__{i think not.}
<P>__{(with a flourish)}
<D>__{after you...}
<A>__{a gun comes into frame, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to gregor's temple.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{after you, asshole.}
<A>__{gregor stiffens, as we pull back on sam, who has snuck up on gregor and gotten the drop on him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you might have been one mean technical spook, gregor, but you wouldn't have lasted a week in the field.}
