<L>__{interior clare's room that evening}
<A>__{clare is sound asleep in bed. camera pans to a corner of the room. the wooden crate holding the golden hooped rod rests here. suddenly, the box's nails begin to twist. turn. as if they were being turned by invisible hands. they fall out of the box. dropping to the floor. one by one. the box slowly opens. the golden hooped rod shikmers in the moonlight. suddenly, the staff begins to move. twisting. shrinking. it changes shape...turning into a golden eagle! the bird slowly flaps its wings and flies out of the open window. into the night. clare continues to peacefully sleep.}
