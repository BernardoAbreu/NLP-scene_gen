<A>__{the mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on a driveway made of tombstones from the jewish cemetery.}
<L>__{exterior patio, goeth's villa day}
<A>__{a patio table set with crystal, china, silver. goeth and hujar are there, in pressed ss uniforms, and two industrialists, bosch and madritsch. one chair is empty.}
<C>__{hujar}
<D>__{your machinery will be moved and installed by the ss at no cost to you. you will pay no rent, no maintenance }
<A>__{hujar glances off, interrupted by schindler's arrival. although he's never been here, the industrialist comes in like he owns the place. all but goeth rise.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, no, come on, sit }
<A>__{he works his way around the table, patting bosch and madritsch on the back he knows them shaking hujar's hand, who he doesn't know. he reaches goeth.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<A>__{goeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{we started without you.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{schindler takes a seat, shakes a napkin onto his lap, nods to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{goeth watches him. the others watch goeth.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i miss anything important?}
<C>__{hujar}
<D>__{i was explaining to mr. bosch and mr. madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into plaszow.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{oh, good, yeah.}
<A>__{schindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did. he drinks. goeth just watches him with what seems to be growing amusement. he nods to hujar to continue.}
<C>__{hujar}
<D>__{since your labor is housed on site, it's available to you at all times. you can work them all night if you want. your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be, they'll be respected }
<A>__{schindler laughs out loud, cutting hujar off. hujar glances over to goeth nonplussed.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he's not sorry at all, and starts in on the plate of food that's set down in front of him.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you know, they told me you were going to be trouble czurda and scherner.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<A>__{goeth slowly shakes his head no... then smiles.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{he looks great, though, doesn't he? i have to know where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk?}
<P>__{(schindler nods)}
<D>__{it's great.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'd say i'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, i don't know.}
<A>__{he shrugs like, those are the breaks, too bad. goeth just smiles. the others watch the two of them, unsure how they're supposed to react.}
