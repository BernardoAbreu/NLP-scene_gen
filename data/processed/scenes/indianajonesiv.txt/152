<A>__{betsy nods. the nazis move closer. clare looks to the sky. she begins to make bizarre...high pitched...noises. a confused betsy makes the same noises. the nazis look at each other and chuckle. the women continue to make the sounds. suddenly, the exact sound seems to echo from the sky. it becomes louder... louder... but it belongs to a hundred voices. the nazis pause. looking upward. puzzled. there is a splattering of birds. they attack from above. the birds' screeching is identical to clare and betsy's calls. the angry birds attack the nazis. pecking. scratching. biting. clare and betsy continue to make the sounds, which causes the birds to ignore them. the nazis scream. dropping their weapons. falling to their knees. each soldier is covered with birds. they are being torn to shreds. clare and betsy turn and run. escaping into the jungle. the nazis' screaming echoes behind them. as they run, clare explains to betsy.}
