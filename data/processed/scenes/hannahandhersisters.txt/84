<L>__{interior hannah's kitchen night}
<A>__{holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen food. near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a glass porthole. in the foreground, the kitchen table is crowded with bowls and plates of food. an open cupboard separates holly from the rest of the room.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(looking offscreen)}
<D>__{hey, hannah? you know, i think lee is really serious about her new boyfriend. yeah, eh, from what i understand he sounds really nice.}
<A>__{hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator. she carries two tomatoes.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{i'm so happy for her. i think she's in love.}
<A>__{hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring holly.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{hey, what's the matter?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(taking a bunch of}
<D>__{celery out and slamming the}
<P>__{refrigerator door)}
<D>__{i'm real upset about what you wrote.}
<A>__{hannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{my script?}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{it's obviously based on elliot and me.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh, so loosely.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no, not "oh, so loosely"! real specifically! is that how you see us?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(shrugging, walking out of the pantry area)}
<D>__{well }
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{can i, can i not accept gestures and feelings from people? do i, do i put people off?}
<A>__{holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{well, it's a made up story.}
<A>__{she dries her hands as hannah, her arms laden with vegetables, strides over to her sister.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{no, it's real exact! the the situations, the dialogue, everything. it's it's full of intimate details between elliot and me! which i don't, i don't see how you could even possibly know about. a conversation we once had about adoption?}
<A>__{hannah storms out a nearby door as holly turns away from the sink.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing, the towel}
<D>__{still in her hand, as she speaks to her}
<P>__{offscreen sister)}
<D>__{well, lee mentioned that to me, so obviously you discussed it with her. you...}
<P>__{(pacing around the table)}
<D>__{i just took the essence and i blew it up into drama.}
<A>__{holly wipes her hand on the towel as hannah reenters the kitchen, carrying even more vegetables.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i don't see how lee could know about these things. i don't! i don't tell her everything.}
<A>__{hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables down on the counter. holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food laden table.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{wow, i guess i hit a nerve.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(turning to look at holly)}
<D>__{you make it sound like, you know, i have no needs or something. you think i'm too self sufficient?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(stopping her mindless}
<D>__{straightening at the}
<P>__{table, reacting)}
<D>__{now, hannah, that's not what i meant, you know.}
<P>__{(walking offscreen to the sink area)}
<D>__{uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "you're so giving. it's not a criticism. we love you. we're grateful."}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(walking out of the}
<D>__{pantry to the food }
<P>__{laden table)}
<D>__{you're grateful, but you resent me.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, wow! i don't want to have this conversation. i didn't do anything wrong.}
<A>__{hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket. she stops at the corner of the table and faces hannah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(onscreen)}
<D>__{y you mentioned to me yourself that you and elliot were having some problems.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which i don't see how you could know about in such detail. how does lee know about these things? how? they're private!}
<A>__{hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her armload of spices, into the pantry area.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(turning to look at}
<D>__{her sister as she}
<P>__{walks past)}
<D>__{well, why don't you share them with us?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(with her back to the camera)}
<D>__{i don't...i don't want to bother everyone.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(facing her sister's back)}
<D>__{that's the pointerior i'd like to be bothered.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(turning to look at holly)}
<D>__{i don't see how you could know about these things unless elliot's been talking to you.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{no, he hasn't. if i offended you, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter. holly turns away. the film cuts to the dining room doorway. guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room. lee and elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation. the piano, as well as soft chatter, is heard in the background.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{it's over, elliot. i don't know how to make it any clearer. it's over. i can't see you anymore.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{uh...}
<P>__{(onscreen, gesturing)}
<D>__{i i i know. i deserve this.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(touching her chest)}
<D>__{look, i'm just as much at fault.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(overlapping, gesturing)}
<D>__{if if if you can believe i have such feelings for you!}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i've got to be honest with you. i met someone else. i've met someone else.}
<P>__{(turning and walking away from elliot)}
<D>__{i...i told you i wasn't going to wait forever.}
<A>__{lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{but it hasn't been forever.}
<P>__{(walking over to lee at the just closed door)}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{it's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...i now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{yeah, but we we made so many plans.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(overlapping, gesturing)}
<D>__{yeah. uh, well, sure we did. an an and in a way you led me on, because i truly believed you were unhappy with hannah. otherwise, i would never have let myself be drawn in. i was very weak. so were you. now i've met someone else.}
<A>__{the door opens and mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks. she walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china. she puts them down as lee and elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(to mavis)}
<D>__{dinner soon?}
<C>__{mavis}
<D>__{about fifteen minutes.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{uh huh. good.}
<A>__{mavis leaves. both lee and elliot quickly close the door behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{and you're in love overnight?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i care a great deal about him, yes.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(trying to put his arm around lee)}
<D>__{lee...}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(pulling back, flinging her hands)}
<D>__{ah, it's over! elliot, i mean it. it's over!}
<A>__{they look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to hannah's kitchen. norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. she looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside. holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(holding the door,}
<D>__{half in and half out}
<P>__{of the kitchen)}
<D>__{sweetheart, i loved your script. i thought it was so clever.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(turning to norma,}
<D>__{smiling, and holding}
<P>__{a glass of wine)}
<D>__{well, you're my mother. not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i particularly liked the character of the mother. just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.}
<A>__{holly chuckles.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{i'm so proud!}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh, mom, thanks.}
<A>__{norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her. holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to hannah's living room. a chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross legged around him on the floor. they lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips. other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa. mavis crosses the well lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests. the piano plays on.}
<C>__{uncle}
<P>__{(raising his bottle of beer to the children)}
<D>__{now here's a toast to thanksgiving, all right?}
<A>__{the children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up their "illicit" glasses of beer.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{are we supposed to have beer? yeeeah!}
<A>__{the uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses. they cry indistinctly with excitement.}
<C>__{uncle}
<P>__{(overlapping the children's squeals of delight)}
<D>__{let me at it!}
<P>__{(to one of the little boys)}
<D>__{how's that, fletcher?}
<A>__{laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is.}
<C>__{uncle}
<P>__{(to the little girl)}
<D>__{doll? to thanksgiving. here's a little toast, doll.}
<P>__{(clinking glasses)}
<D>__{come on. bottoms up.}
<A>__{the uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in hannah's bedroom. her face moves on to the screen.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(to the offscreen elliot)}
<D>__{have you been talking to holly or lee about us? about our our personal life?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{me? of course not.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{there's things holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{look, i've got a splitting headache and i don't like being accused.}
<A>__{hannah walks towards elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i'm not accusing. i'm asking. do you...do you find me too...too giving?}
<P>__{(closing the door of}
<D>__{the bathroom slightly so only she is seen}
<P>__{on the screen)}
<D>__{too too too competent? too too, i don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(following elliot and}
<D>__{gesturing, talking to}
<P>__{his back)}
<D>__{well, what is it then? what? eh, what's come between us? how have i alienated you?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(taking a bottle of}
<D>__{aspirin from the cabinet and walking}
<P>__{back to the sink, gesturing)}
<D>__{hannah, my head is throbbing.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{you never want to talk about it. i every time i bring it up, you you change the subject. what is it? do you we're communicating less and less. you sleep with me less and less.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(angrily turning to}
<D>__{hannah and pointing}
<P>__{as she shouts)}
<D>__{hannah, i am very mixed up! now please!}
<A>__{elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(reacting, her voice}
<D>__{trembling slightly,}
<P>__{and gesturing)}
<D>__{do you talk to holly or lee behind my back? do you? you must. they they seem to know so much about us.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(walking towards a towel rack and gesturing)}
<D>__{well, maybe i've asked advice once or twice or or made a joke.}
<A>__{he dries his hands as hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well, what do you do? do do do you talk to holly, or lee, or what? do you, do you, do you phone them?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(whirling around to face hannah, snapping)}
<D>__{leave me alone, can you?!}
<A>__{he closes the door, briefly obscuring hannah and himself from view.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(continuing in a lower tone)}
<D>__{jesus, i've told you. i need someone i can matter to.}
<A>__{the camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(reacting, near tears)}
<D>__{you matter to me. completely.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(pausing, his voice rising again)}
<D>__{it's hard to be around someone who gives so much and and needs so little in return!}
<A>__{he opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing, pleading)}
<D>__{but, look...i i have enormous needs.}
<A>__{elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{well, i can't see them, and neither can lee or holly!}
<A>__{he leaves. hannah watches him go, reacting. she is stunned.}
