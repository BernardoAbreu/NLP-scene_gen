<L>__{exterior camp site night}
<A>__{med. shot. mary stands in the moonlight by the wagon, looking out across the meadow. below, near the creek, the horses graze. there is the soft jangle of a bell as the bell mare moves her head. clay comes walking up from the creek, rifle in hand. he passes without noticing mary. mary turns.}
<B>__{reverse shot}
<A>__{mary in close f.g. the campfire burns low. steve lies on his stomach close to it. clay stops beside him to glance down, then moves on to sit on a rock above the fire. mary starts toward the fire.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{steve. open in front of him is a copy of leslie's weekly, a woman's journal: pictures of baby basinettes, whale bone corsets, fancy oil lamps, etc. mary comes into scene to stand above him, looking down. steve glances up and smiles.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is that your kind of reading, steve?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i can't read, ma'am. i just look at the pictures.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled down past clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you can't read?}
<A>__{she glances up where clay sits.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{since i can remember, ma'am.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{clay. he listens, perturbed.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{mary and steve.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it wasn't clay's fault. we've been moving around most all the time mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place i can learn my letters then }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{don't you even know your letters?}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{clay. he winces at!}
<C>__{steve's voice}
<D>__{no, ma'am.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{mary, steve and clay. behind them, clay rises and comes down nearer the fire.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{would you like to learn them?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i sure would.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe i could start you out.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that'd be swell.}
<P>__{(shyly)}
<D>__{you know, you're an awful lot different than i thought you'd be.}
<A>__{she gives him a quick look of inquiry.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you're so nice.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{did someone say i wasn't nice?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{oh no. nobody said nothing to me. only i got the idea that well clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window i could see you dancing, but clay always took me over to the other side of the street.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{time to go to bed, steve.}
<A>__{steve looks up, then rises reluctantly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{good night, miss wells.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{good night, steve.}
<A>__{steve exits. mary looks after him, then up at clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{there's a nice boy.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{that why you always took him on the other side of the street?}
<A>__{clay kicks loose embers into the fire.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sharper)}
<D>__{maybe i don't make the grade in some ways, but i know enough to teach a kid his letters.}
<A>__{clay turns from the fire to stand above her.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{he doesn't know his letters, no but he knows the names of animals... he knows what roots to eat when you're clear out of food... he knows the difference between a possum and a coon just by lookin' at the tracks... more than most trappers know... and he can tell whether she'll rain or shine tomorrow by smelling the air tonight. there's a lot of things he doesn't know, i hope he'll never learn.}
<A>__{he pauses, looking down.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{like sticking his nose into other people's business.}
<A>__{clay moves out of the circle of firelight to stop and pick up his rifle, tarp and blanket, then climbs the knoll. mary stares into the fire, then rising she starts toward the wagon.}
