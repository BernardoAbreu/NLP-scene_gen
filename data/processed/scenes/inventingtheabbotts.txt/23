<A>__{lloyd abbott's 1957 cadillac pulls up to the pumps. lloyd is behind the wheel, joan sits next to him, eleanor and pamela are in the back seat. the ding ding of the bell hose summons...}
<L>__{interior texaco station jacey}
<A>__{ sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell. he hesitates as he sees the abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them. he retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor.}
<C>__{eleanor }
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{jacey finds eleanor standing in the garage doorway.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i heard you got accepted to penn.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{oh. yeah. thanks.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{how'd you swing an ivy league school like that?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{my grandfather went there. i had the grades, so...}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{it stinks in here.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i dropped something.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{yeah, me.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i just thought you and steve...}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{well, that's what you thought. i think steve is... i don't even know what i think about steve, i never think about him. i just do things. and let other people figure them out. that's what parents are for. they're real good at doing all the thinking. why should i?}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{alice is going to have a baby. she and kilroy didn't waste any time. he's already talking about having another, and alice is up chucking every hour on the hour. she's got morning noon and night sickness. i've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. wallpaper patterns that's all she talks about. she and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. that's another thing i never think about... wallpaper.}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{well, i think this is called the silent treatment. i get enough of that from my father, i don't need it from you. good luck at penn.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away, but jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely eleanor responds with equal heat. they don't see pamela enter the garage. pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then:}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{come on, eleanor dad's waiting.}
