<L>__{interior cab night}
<A>__{"brill" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to all views, as dean climbs in the back. "brill" flips on the meter and guns into traffic.}
<D>__{"brill" what happened?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{it started with the information you gave me on depinto. after we talked, he agreed to resign. next, a phony detective asked me about daniel zavitz. then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed zavitz was behind. the fbi started looking into mob connections. a doctored picture in the paper. overnight, i'm ruined. wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.}
<A>__{"brill" eyes the mirror. a black chevy appears several car lengths behind.}
<D>__{"brill" depinto's dead.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{oh jesus. "brill" they found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. what about zavitz?}
<A>__{"brill" starts to weave in and out of traffic. he looks in the mirror the chevy's also weaving several cars behind.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i don't know anything about zavitz. "brill" you said he was behind an extortion scheme.}
<C>__{dean}
<A>__{they said he was behind an}
<D>__{extortion scheme.}
<A>__{"brill" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.}
<D>__{"brill" and you were the last one to talk to him.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{yes. "brill" what'd he say to you?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{nothing. "brill" what'd he give to you?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{nothing. "brill" don't bullshit me, i can save your life.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i'm telling you, i }
<A>__{the ride from hell gets worse as "brill" screeches another turn. the car ahead stops and "brill" screeches past on two wheels.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{i just gave him my card. "brill" he didn't give you an address? he didn't give you a phone number?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{nothing. two nights later i was robbed. i'm pretty sure they were pros.}
<A>__{"brill" takes an impossible left into another alley. the chevy follows. "brill"'s good. the guy in the chevy's better.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{um...who's that? "brill" don't know. did you check everywhere? maybe it was hidden in something. maybe there was someone else }
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{someone else? "brill" maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.}
<A>__{the cab is rear ended hard by the chevy. their necks snap back from the force.}
<P>__{"brill" (cont'd)}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{wham! they're hit again. "brill" pulls out a communicator.}
<P>__{"brill" (cont'd)}
<D>__{209 to anyone! i need some help here!}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{who are you calling?!}
<A>__{whack! "brill" back hands dean with his fist, knocking him silly as wham! the cab's rear ended again.}
<D>__{"brill"}
<P>__{(trying again)}
<D>__{this is 209! does anyone copy?!}
<A>__{then "brill" sees that the alley empties into a busy street, then a bakery shop. he slams the brakes. tires screech smoke but it's no use. the powerful chevy pushes the cab, bumper to bumper, toward the street. "brill" grips the wheel. it's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross traffic and blam! they're broad sided by a delivery truck. the cab is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the broken main. dean slowly opens his eyes. water pours in everywhere. "brill" is sticking halfway through a window, not moving. seeing "brill"'s pistol, dean grabs it and crawls from the wreckage.}
