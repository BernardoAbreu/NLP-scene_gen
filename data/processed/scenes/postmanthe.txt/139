<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{ford, hidden in the woods, smiles at the sound.}
<L>__{exterior holnist camp night}
<A>__{bethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the night.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{you want a war? i will give you a war. i was born for it!}
<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{bethlehem's words reach ford, his smile fades. he's just a scared boy. he kicks his horse into a gallop and rides away.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior small airfield day}
<A>__{in the fog, the sound of hollow hoof beats. the postman rides past the shapes of airplanes. standing silent. forever grounded. the ghosts of the past.}
<L>__{exterior rv camp day}
<A>__{ford is swearing in four new recruits.}
<B>__{on ford and recruits}
<A>__{as they repeat after him we realize they've changed the oath a bit.}
<D>__{ford recruits neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night. through bandit's hell, through fire fight. through flood and plague we cannot fail. no holnist trash will stop the mail.}
<B>__{the postman}
<A>__{riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with mail. he pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words they're saying. as he dismounts, a fresh faced carrier takes the bridle. the postman's well past the point of fatigue. he's living on pure adrenaline.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{get this mail sorted. bring me a fresh horse. something to eat.}
<A>__{as fresh face starts away, the postman calls after him.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{and all the mail going south!}
<A>__{the postman watches as ford shakes the hands of the new recruits. the postman reaches for his canteen. empty. damn. a tin cup filled with water appears from nowhere. abby. the postman takes it, too tired to acknowledge the gesture.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{they changed the oath.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ford's idea.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{figures.}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{they don't think to ask who they're replacing. or why.}
<A>__{he drains the cup and hands it back to her. just then, one of the new recruits, luke, steps over.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sir? it'd be an honor if i could shake your hand.}
<A>__{a farmboy type, luke looks like a younger version of woody. the postman sees this, is lost in reverie. luke still holds his hand out.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you look like... do i know you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{well, good luck to you.}
<A>__{nodding in awe, luke heads off.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{nice kid. probably be dead in a week.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(ignores it)}
<D>__{you're exhausted. you need rest. there's food in the trailer }
<A>__{ponytail rides by; two sacks of mail hang from her saddle pommel. the postman grabs her horse's halter, stops her.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{route twenty two. i'm already an hour late.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you're grounded. get off the horse. you know the rule.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{what rule?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{twenty two's too far south.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{but they're waiting on their mail down there.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{get off the goddamn horse.}
<A>__{shocked, she does. at the same time, fresh face comes up leading a second horse laden with mail.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(re: ponytail's horse)}
<D>__{tie him off to this one.}
<A>__{fresh face goes about tying the second horse to the first.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you can't keep doing this.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{riding all the routes. you're not saving anyone.}
<A>__{the postman climbs on ponytail's horse, looks at abby.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman, abby?}
<P>__{(doesn't give her time to answer)}
<D>__{i don't know if you'd laugh or cry.}
<A>__{the postman digs in his heels. the horse gallops away, the second one following behind.}
