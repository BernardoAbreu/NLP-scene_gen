<L>__{interior macleod house kitchen morning}
<A>__{drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying her open daybook. dr. quinn macleod, dressed professionally and obviously together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and her husband, professor charley macleod, who enters still in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed head. as a matter of routine, quinn holds out his cup and he takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{morning, dad.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{morning, baby.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{how's the book coming?}
<C>__{charley}
<P>__{(sigh)}
<D>__{well, sweety, my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam. for a long time i just let the great ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over and the words just come pouring out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{still stuck, huh?}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{not a word.}
<A>__{parker enters with her blackberry in hand, smooches her pop, then takes a sat. parker's clearly a chip off her dad's block. both pour milk first into their bowl, then charley drops in super sugar crisp while parker pours in count chocula. both hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar. mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat toast that she slices in half first. like mom, like drew. drew spots the blackberry jpeg of warren before parker can turn it over.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{another one for the trophy room, huh?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{boys can be fun. you should try one some time.}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{you ready for your interview?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(funny you should ask)}
<D>__{i've prepared a color coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue red, double checked the train schedule, confirmed with the weather channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just to account for all the possible glitches.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we'll take that as a yes.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{i'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years, sweety.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i still don't understand why you want to finish college in two years? what's the big hurry?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i want to hit the ground running. all those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene. it just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{the accelerated program would look great on your med school application.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{football games i get. but partying? a waste of time?}
<A>__{parker looks to her dad. he shrugs.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{to each her own.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{well, drew. i have a surprise.}
<A>__{everybody stops what they're doing for a beat.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i took the day off.}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{i'm going into the city with you.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{what ?!}
<A>__{drew chokes on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{isn't that great! we can do some shopping, have lunch, real girl stuff. won't that be fun?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{if you want to have fun, i'm the one who should go, not mother teresa over there.}
<A>__{drew is still choking pretty badly.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{let me know if you want me to do the heimlich. it'd be cool to have you owe me your life.}
<A>__{whoosh! the granola goes down and she sucks air.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(still clearing)}
<D>__{no... i mean, it's... impossible. i've got every minute accounted for right up to the interview. blue and red! it won't work.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i just thought... you know... i've been working and we haven't had a chance to spend much time together...}
<A>__{quinn, the normally thick skinned m.d., is tearing up.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{... and both my babies are going away to college next fall.}
<A>__{she takes her plate and goes to the sink and parker follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{don't be sad, mom. just think, when drew leaves for school, you won't be losing a daughter, you'll be losing an anal retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin.}
<A>__{drew throws an arm around quinn's other shoulder.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mom. it's really sweet of you. but don't worry. parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{stop it, you two.}
<A>__{mom blows her nose.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it's not fair you guys get to go into the city and i don't.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{don't you have a chem test, young lady?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{chemistry? please. name one time you ever used chemistry in your life.}
<C>__{charley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{i use chemistry every day.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're a doctor, mom. i'm not going to be a doctor. i can't even say the word 'orifice,' let alone put a finger up one.}
<A>__{the beep beep of drew's alarm watch signals time to go. drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the news that her mother's going to accompany her.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{time to go.}
