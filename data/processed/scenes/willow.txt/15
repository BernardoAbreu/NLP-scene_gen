<L>__{exterior ufgood farm day}
<A>__{burglekutt's beady eyes spot willow making a mad dash for his plow. swinging his fat stomach, he angrily points his walking stick and goes after him.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{mr. burglekutt! he hasn't done anything wrong!}
<A>__{willow's wife kiaya chases burglekutt across the field, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her. willow quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all day.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{ufgood! what do you think you're doing! i tell the planting seeds in this village.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{i told him we didn't steal it, wil low.}
<A>__{burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of willow's sack and shakes them under willow's nose.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{you haven't paid your debts. where did you get these seeds?}
<A>__{with pride, willow puts his arm around his wife.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{in the forest. my family's been gathering them since last fall. there's no law against that, bur glekutt.}
<A>__{suddenly the children laugh in the distance.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow! you left the children alone by the river??}
<A>__{in alarm she runs off before willow can stop her. bur glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{too late, ufgood. you'll never get your planting done before the rains start. you're gonna lose this land.}
<A>__{he raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes them down at willow's boots. he waddles away toward two of his men who wait by the road. then: kiaya shrieks from the river. burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's crazy." off he trudges. willow watches and waits. then runs as fast as he can to the river.}
