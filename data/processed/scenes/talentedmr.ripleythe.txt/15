<A>__{italy. brilliant sunshine. the queen mary has just docked. passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows. coming from the first class gangways they are greeted, escorted, fussed over into the hall. their bags have been unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall under the initials of their owners. stands with the letters of the alphabet chalked on them are dotted about, and trunks and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around them. ripley enters and an italian porter approaches, wants his name. ripley. ripley. ripley! he repeats in the hubbub and joins the crowd around the letter r . a striking young woman (meredith) is nearby. she notices him. ripley proceeds to the customs area, where he's held in a line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. meredith catches up with him. her luggage a mountain next to his.}
