<A>__{at a workbench, under a single lamp, stephen stands amongst a confusion of tools, wire, and a wall socket. with a pair of pliers, he tugs at something within the socket, puts the face plate back on and screws it down. he stares at it, and we feel the sudden wave of hopelessness cascading through him. he sets the socket back down and scatters everything aside in a single, furious move.}
