<L>__{interior kitchen.}
<A>__{david gets a couple of steps in and stops. he looks across the room to see:}
<B>__{reverse angle.}
<A>__{betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the window. her back is to him. she grips the formica kitchen counter.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(approaching slowly)}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. david moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{betty turns around to face him. her face has turned}
<B>__{completely to color. the eyes are green. the lips are red.}
<A>__{she has a natural blush in her cheeks. in fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{what am i going to do?}
<A>__{david moves closer and looks at her. her lip is quivering.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's okay. it's alright.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{i can't go out there. how can i go out there?}
<A>__{she looks right up at david.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{look at me ...}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{he stares at her for a second. big green eyes full of fear and confusion. david pushes a reassuring smile.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{have you got any make up?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{in my handbag.}
<A>__{he crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. david sits betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact. he finds it along with a wadded up kleenex.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay first we'll dry you out a little.}
<A>__{he dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude, then david opens the compact and takes out the large gray powder puff.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{it is a truly amazing sight. as david smears on the makeup, she returns gradually to black and white. the skin tones disappear. the flush of her cheeks goes. david takes out a dark gray lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips. reverse angle. over betty's shoulder. he works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back. all at once, david seems to wince: reverse angle. his pov. betty's face. the life is gone from her face. in an instant betty has gone from three dimensions to two. she stands in front of him, the fictional version of herself all over again.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(off his reaction)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{david shakes his head and forces a smile. he hands her the compact so she can examine herself. betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{does it look okay?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{looks just like it did.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{and they won't be able to tell?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(even quieter)}
<D>__{no ... they won't be able to tell.}
<A>__{betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. she grabs the plate of pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide "stewardess" smile ...}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he wants to say something, but doesn't. david shakes his head.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<A>__{she smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room, extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of her ...}
