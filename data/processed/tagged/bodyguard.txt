<A>__{devaney shakes his head no. frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page. from many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. occasionally, one will have a photo of rachel with crude markings on it. spector enters sucking on a popsicle. he comes to stand over frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{devaney says you were in the secret service.}

<A>__{we see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve. the cover reads "rachel marron the #1 hits." the cassette is gently eased into the slot of the video player. rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, intensely, passionately into the camera. we track into the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.}
<B>__{angle frank}
<A>__{frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the tv, dressed in a business style blue suit and tie. he's watching rachel's videos. scattered around the video player are a collection of other rachel marron cd's, tapes and videos. frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. some of the phrases are circled. as he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. it is as if he really were looking at rachel for the first time, here, watching her sing. for a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. he opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled russian orthodox type cross. he fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen.}

(the hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) gazing across the garden, she sees the light in frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too.}

<A>__{rachel dances erotically with the man bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees. the crowd roars approval. frank quickly sizes up the scene. he speaks into a surv kit microphone in his sleeve. across the room we see henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. henry quickly scurries to an exit. frank starts moving toward the stage. at that moment, the lucky man rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be. one of security guards rushes forward to extri cate her. the spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on rachel. she flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans. the audience goes wild. this is the kind of thing rachel was famous for when she was starting out. the scene resembles a rugby scrum... with rachel the ball. frank sees rachel being passed over the heads of fans deeper into the audience. her dress is ripped and torn apart. the silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd.}

<D>__{under control. but it won't be the same... ya mutt.}
<A>__{tony fakes a glancing blow to frank's chin. over by the plane, fletcher spots frank and tugs at rachel's dress, till she turns to look. fletcher runs up to frank and hugs him around the knees. rachel approaches and tony moves back toward the plane. devaney waves in frank's direction, tapping his watch to indicate they are late. frank waves and smiles. rachel's surprised to see frank, but clearly happy. fletcher is ecstatic.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you shouldn't be here.}
<A>__{frank laughs. there is a pause.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so, you're quitting show business?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{too bad. you had talent. what are you going to do?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought i might hole up with my dad.}
<P>__{(pats bandaged torso)}
<D>__{finish that chess game.}
<A>__{rachel nods approvingly.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{get him when fletcher's not around.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(ruffling fletcher's hair)}
<D>__{that's the idea.}
<A>__{fletcher grins. rachel starts to cry.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so, how's the new guy?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he's got white hair, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he's very good.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{why'd you have to get me an old man?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't trust you.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{yeah... well, give me a kiss and let's get this over with.}
<A>__{frank gives her an awkward hug. they kiss.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{'bye rachel.}
<A>__{rachel turns quickly. she almost runs up the boarding ladder. frank remains watching her. fletcher looks back over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.}
<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{rachel takes a seat beside fletcher. devaney leans over the aisle.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{that wasn't so bad.}
<P>__{(he sees her tears)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{rachel is in her own world. devaney passes the word to get moving. the engines warm up. rachel turns and sees frank still standing there looking at her.}
<L>__{interior cockpit day}
<A>__{the pilot's hand pushes forward on the throttle.}
<L>__{exterior plane day}
<A>__{the nosewheel starts to taxi. the plane moves forward.}
<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{rachel's face at the window.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{wait...}
<L>__{exterior tarmac day}
<A>__{the steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not fast enough for rachel. she jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair. without pausing, she runs to frank who takes her in his arms. they embrace and kiss. they kiss again and again. finally, slowly, rachel draws back, her eyes are filled with tears.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{remember when you said you'd risk your life for me?}
<A>__{frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i didn't really believe it then. nobody means what they say. but you did, frank. you did it. you laid it all on the line for me.}
<A>__{frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't wreck this for me. i don't want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job. you did more than save my life, frank. you showed me a way to be. and i love you for it.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there, i said it.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{i will never forget what it felt like to be under your eye. never.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i won't be forgetting you either.}
<A>__{she presses something into frank's hand.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{here... i want you to keep this. if you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are i will find you. i promise.}
<A>__{she gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane, her eyes holding frank's. frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross.}
<B>__{on frank}
<A>__{as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out. the roar of the plane becomes applause.}
<L>__{exterior concert night}
<A>__{rachel's face in full frame, bathed in light and the applause of a huge audience.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{thank you... thank you... now i want to sing you an old song, but it's a new favorite.}
<A>__{as the music begins, rachel stands alone in front of the band, mike in hand.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you know, this song used to make me feel sad... but it doesn't anymore.}
<A>__{rachel pauses. the audience is still.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now it just reminds me of someone very special... this is for him.}
<A>__{rachel begins to sing the song 'what becomes of the broken hearted' slow and sweet. it's the song she and frank danced to. as a verse trails off }
<L>__{interior clermont hotel (iowa city) night}
<A>__{it is a rotary dinner. the camera tracks along the front of the head table which runs from one side of the room to the other.}
<C>__{rotary president }
<D>__{our speaker this evening, the honorable congressman from the fifth district, galen windsor, has been a lone, courageous, voice... he alone has challenged those who have linked organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state.}
<A>__{still tracking, we see the rotary president as he nods to a distinguished looking gentleman one seat to his right. on the wall a sign identifying the hotel and a club banner which reads "the rotary club of iowa city." the camera continues to track and the rotary president goes out of frame.}
<C>__{rotary president }
<D>__{but first our benediction will be delivered by reverend phillip hardy of the first presbyterian church.}
<A>__{still tracking we see the reverend get up as the men around him bow their heads.}
<C>__{reverend hardy}
<D>__{heavenly father, please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty.}
<A>__{still tracking as we reach the end of the table.}
<C>__{reverend hardy }
<D>__{and lord, whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your sanctuary.}
<A>__{the camera stops. standing against the wall behind the table is frank. as the reverend's prayer goes on, all heads are bowed to receive the benediction. all heads but frank's. the camera moves in tight on his face.}
<C>__{reverend hardy}
<D>__{... for all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us... guiding and protecting us. amen.}
<A>__{the reverend's final words segue into rachel's song. frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for a moment as though reacting to rachel's voice.}
<L>__{interior concert night}
<A>__{rachel ends a phrase. she dabs at the corner of her eye as she continues the song that still binds them together.}
<L>__{interior rotary club dinner night}
<B>__{very close on frank}
<A>__{his expression, so intense in the opening scene of the film, is softer now. rachel's voice continues as frank carefully scans the room.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<C>__{the end}
