<C>__{bob }
<D>__{my wife, debora, told me later that ron's death had been like a wake up call for her what people used to call a memento mori.}
<A>__{bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead man's desk. he notices a large indentation on the leather in front of him the mark left by ron's forehead. he touches it, fascinated.}
<D>__{bob (cont'd) (v.o.) (cont'd) that massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness.}
<A>__{bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. his eyes wander over to where dave and debora are talking in dave's office. bob's p.o.v debora's hand brushes against dave's, lingers just a fraction too long. bob frowns.}
<D>__{bob (cont'd) (v.o.) (cont'd) a week after the funeral she left me for my editor.}
