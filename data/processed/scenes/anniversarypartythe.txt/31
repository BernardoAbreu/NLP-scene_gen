<A>__{the camera stays close on the cake as america wheels the cart into the living room. the top of it sports sally and joe's faces on either side of otis, a detailed edible photograph. there are three sixes across the top. there's a freed up pathway. cal taps the side of his champagne glass with a fork.}

<A>__{clair picks up discarded dinner plates. otis takes care of those behind couches, under tables. the gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace. sally is on the floor, nestled between joe's knees, leaning back against him. his arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against hers. there's a series of cuts through speeches, gifts, entertainment. sophia and cal do a well rehearsed, very funny, impromptu something with their kids. panes and mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage. cal and sophia carry sleeping children down the hall. there are speeches about sally and joe, outrageously dirty, funny, sometimes touching that cover their recent separation, the custody of otis, their trying to have a baby... panes plays a piece on the violin. someone else sings. and finally... medium close skye she looks out at the guests...}
