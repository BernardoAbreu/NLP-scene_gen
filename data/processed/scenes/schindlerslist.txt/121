<L>__{interior metalworks plaszow day}
<A>__{goeth moves through the crowded metalworks like a goodnatured foreman, nodding to this worker, wishing that one a good morning. he seems satisfied, even pleased, with the level of production. goldberg is with him. they reach a particular bench, a particular worker, and goeth smiles pleasantly.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{what are you making?}
<A>__{not daring to look up, all the worker sees of goeth is the starched cuff of his shirt.}
<C>__{levartov}
<D>__{hinges, sir.}
<A>__{the rabbi turned metalworker gestures with his head to a pile of hinges on the floor. goeth nods. and in a tone more like a friend than anything else }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{i got some workers coming in tomorrow... where the hell they from again?}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{yugoslavia.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{yugoslavia. i got to make room.}
<A>__{he shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{make me a hinge.}
<A>__{as goeth times him, rabbi levartov works at making a hinge as though his life depended on it which it does cutting the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking away. he finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor. forty seconds.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{another.}
<A>__{again the rabbi works feverishly cutting, crimping, sanding, hearing the seconds ticking in his head and finishing in thirty five. goeth nods, impressed.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{that's very good. what i don't understand, though, is you've been working since what, about six this morning? yet such a small pile of hinges?}
<A>__{he understands perfectly. so does levartov; he has just crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds. goeth stands him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders. he pulls out his pistol, puts it to the rabbi's head and pulls the trigger... click.}
<C>__{goeth}
<P>__{(mumble)}
<D>__{christ }
<A>__{annoyed, goeth extracts the bullet magazine, slaps it back in and puts the barrel back to the man's head. he pulls the trigger again... and again there's a click.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{god damn it }
<A>__{he slams the weapon across levartov's face and the rabbi slumps dazed to the floor. looking up into goeth's face, he knows it's not over. as goeth walks away }
