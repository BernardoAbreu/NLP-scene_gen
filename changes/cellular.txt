In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers from a gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet. CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the front walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black Escalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer.}

They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead.
