<L>__{exterior la push clearing in the forest (continuous) day}

<C>__{edward }
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{bella turns to find the apparition of edward standing next to her. her hand slips off the clutch, the bike bucks and falls on top of her. jacob quickly lifts it off her as the apparition of edward disappears.}
<C>__{jacob}

<P>__{(yelling to jacob)}
<D>__{i don't how do i turn!?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bank it! bank hit the brake!}
<A>__{jacob races toward her. she reaches the turn, doesn't bank, goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees. as she lies on the ground dazed, jacob hurries up.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what, are you training for the x games?}
<A>__{she looks around for edward. he's gone.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i want to go again.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{forget it. i'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. man, look at your head.}
<A>__{indeed, blood drips down her forehead. he pulls off his shirt to mop it up. she shrinks away }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{god, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're apologizing for bleeding?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it doesn't... bother you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's just blood, bella.}
<A>__{he bends over her, carefully tending her head. she finds herself looking at him. his dark eyes, his bare chest and smooth skin. he glances at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you staring at?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{just, you're actually... good looking.}
<A>__{he's surprised; there's a moment between them. he smiles.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how hard did you hit your head?}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh i yeah.}
<A>__{he offers her a hand, helps her up. she holds onto it, alarmed.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{jake, you're hot.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{upgraded from good looking?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{no, temperature hot.}
<P>__{(feels his forehead)}
<D>__{you're burning up.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i feel fine.}
<A>__{he takes her hand from his forehead. holds it. she tries to pull it away.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what? i can't hold your hand?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it just... means something else to you than it does to me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{one, that's my problem. but two... we have fun, you think i'm hot }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{good looking.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i know you like me.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{more than anyone. but... that's all.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{because of cullen?}
<A>__{the name stings her. he takes both her hands now.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{look, i know what he did to you. i can see it in your face every time his name comes up. but you need to know i would never, ever do that to you. i promise i will never hurt you. you can count on me.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i already do. you don't know how much. you're my best friend but... i don't think my feelings will change.}
<A>__{he takes this in, it's hard. a wave of something sweeps over him. he sits back. closes his eyes, takes a breath.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i should've said something right from the start }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. that's not i just feel... weird.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i told you, you have a fever. probably that flu everyone has.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it doesn't... feel like flu. i don't know what it is.}
<A>__{off jacob, rattled, and bella, concerned...}
