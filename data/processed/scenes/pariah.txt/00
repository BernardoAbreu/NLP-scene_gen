<L>__{ext interior nightclub evening}
<A>__{a disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and hats crosses a narrow street. lights flare, hands are stamped, torsos are patted down. money exchanges hands. we descend into a black, throbbing tunnel. explicit music booms from bassy club speakers. hips, legs feet dancing. a go go dancer struts and wiggles around a brass pole. hoots and cheers. the dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom. more cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.}
<C>__{female dj }
<D>__{let's go! where all my sexy sagittarian ladies at?}
<A>__{arms go up. a collection of whoops ripple the crowd. the dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst. the camera rotates as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd. we realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling.}
<C>__{female dj }
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{alike (pronounced ah lee kay), 17, covers her mouth, laughing and wide eyed. she tries to back away from the stage, but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills. among them is laura, 18, worldly and smooth.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{where your singles at?!! where your singles at?!! yeah, baby!}
<A>__{laura strains over alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancer's boot. alike drops her beer in all the jostling.}
<C>__{female dj}
<D>__{goddamn i love my job!}
<A>__{laura stuffs a bill into alike's now empty hand and forcibly waves alike's wrist in the air. alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{stop! chill!!}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{whatchu' come here for?!}
<A>__{alike shoves the dollar bill into laura's chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage. laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage. alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{excuse me. sorry. excuse me. oof, sorry ladies.}
<A>__{finally free of the throng, alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes back to the stage where laura is no longer visible. not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd, she retreats for the bar.}
<C>__{female dj}
<D>__{let's go!}
