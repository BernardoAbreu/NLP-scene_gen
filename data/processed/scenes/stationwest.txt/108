<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{as mark hurries into the saloon, a desperate look on his face.}
<L>__{interior charlie's office day}
<A>__{as charlie turns from the window.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{bristow's here.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{this should be good.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to mick)}
<D>__{let him in.}
<A>__{mick goes to the door, opens it; just as mark arrives a little breathlessly at the door. mark enters, a little surprised at the door opening for him, glancing back as mick quietly shuts it. charlie looks coldly at the lawyer who is sweating again. mark stands there, silent a moment, gathering himself together.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you want the i.o.u's?}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{you mean }
<A>__{she has turned to the safe; now she turns with them and as mark reaches for them, charlie drops them at his feet. they scatter. he bends to pick them up. prince smiles at him contemptuously. mark is picking them up one at a time when suddenly he pauses, stands erect, and looks at them with fear and suspicion.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{why? did haven }
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{no, he didn't.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{then i don't understand }
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{we don't think they're going to be any good.}
<A>__{mark stands there. the papers slip from his fingers. he knows what prince means. but his mouth hardens in an effort.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{i didn't have anything to do with it. all i did was write it. i'm not in on this. i can still make them good.}
<P>__{(he puts a couple back on the desk)}
<D>__{or i can }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{i can do business.}
<P>__{(fumbling in his pocket)}
<D>__{i got it somewhere. i here take a look at this the deposition }
<P>__{(bringing out the deposition)}
<D>__{the only copy.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{let's have it.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{hands it to her.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(as charlie opens the envelope)}
<D>__{nothing. i just want to get out of it. i never had any part of it. this ought to prove that!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{this?}
<A>__{she hands him the paper from the envelope. marks takes it and stares at it. it is absolutely a blank piece of paper. he stands there, bites his lips. he looks wearily around at them, fear making him weak, making him unable to hold the piece of paper, so that it floats to the carpet.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(at last)}
<D>__{it's it's a trick. i }
<P>__{(trying to pull himself together)}
<D>__{i will see about this! he can't do this to me!}
<P>__{(moving back towards the door)}
<D>__{i will go and see about this!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sure, you see about it.}
<A>__{he stops dead in his tracks as charlie moves towards him with a little pistol, pearl handled. but she only gives it to him. she has to take his hand and put it in his palm.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{take this along.}
<A>__{he backs out, the little gun in his hand. mick opens the door. in sudden relief and haste mark barrels out. they can hear his quick feet on the stairs outside. prince looks at charlie.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{something left to wait for?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{prince gets up and leaves, and mick, with a grim smile of anticipation follows. charlie sits slowly down in the chair. the music comes up the stairs and through the door.}
