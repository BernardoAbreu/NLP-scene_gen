<A>__{the beach music over erica and harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch. harry is telling erica a story and she screams with laughter. brown stones in the sand music continues erica picks them up as.she walks with harry by the water's edge. they talk non stop. a little later lightning streaks the sky out of nowhere, a downpour. erica and harry gather their picnic things. the blanket starts to fly and harry grabs it as erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.}
