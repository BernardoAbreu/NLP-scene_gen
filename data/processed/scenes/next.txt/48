<L>__{exterior grocery store parking lot day}
<A>__{cris waits impatiently by her jeep. liz finally approaches, carrying a couple of heavy bags filled with wine and booze.}
<D>__{cris what took so long?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i ran into a friend i hadn't seen in a while.}
<A>__{liz holds out a single key on a ring.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{she said we could use her cabin up at the peak.}
<B>__{across the street}
<A>__{ferris rejoins cavanaugh and ferris in rick's car.}
<D>__{cavanaugh did you tell her about the future thing? ferris of course not. i wanted her to believe me. but i loaded her up with liquor, to dim his headlights.}
<A>__{exterior mountain road day liz's jeep grinds up a steep, winding road, past a sign that says "state line." she turns onto a dirt driveway that leads to a cabin and a glorious panorama.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{god, this is gorgeous.}
<A>__{inspired, he kisses her, but she's distant.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{she smiles wanly, then gives him a peck.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{she hops out of the truck. exterior stakeout site across the canyon day cavanaugh and rick look through binoculars. ferris peers through a telescope on a tripod. baines approaches with a half dozen tech and construction guys.}
<D>__{baines okay, when you press the remote, the cabin will lock down like a big jail cell.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{but silently, right?}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{unnoticeably.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{and that's when we go in.}
<A>__{ferris rolls her eyes with exasperation.}
<D>__{ferris you still don't get it.}
<P>__{(tries to be patient)}
<D>__{this has to be clear to your whole army.}
<P>__{(to baines)}
<D>__{and yours. after she comes out and we lock down the cabin...we don't do anything. we wait. policeman rick but if he's already trapped...?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{gentlemen, try to think like him. if the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's trapped...}
<P>__{(to cavanaugh)}
<D>__{like he's always done. cavanaugh how does your plan change anything? baines at least he won't hear it when the trap closes.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{and if he doesn't know he's trapped, he can't foresee knowing he's trapped.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{that kinda makes sense.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{the eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{when is that? ferris that's the pointerior we want to delay "eureka" for as long as possible. so by the time he sees trouble and decides to waltz away... baines}
<P>__{(finally gets it)}
<D>__{he's already been in the trap for hours.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{voila.}
<A>__{cavanaugh and rick nod with a kind of awe.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you're smart.}
<A>__{baines looks at her with new respect.}
