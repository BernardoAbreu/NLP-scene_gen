<L>__{interior library morning}
<A>__{the president is worried about what rand is telling him. he paces, smokes a cigarette. chance smiles through it all.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{... there is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where i see it, mr. president, the free enterprise system has reached the breaking pointerior we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{it's that serious, huh?}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<A>__{the president now looks nearly as bad as rand. he sits, turns to chance.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{do you agree with ben, mr. gardiner? are we finished? or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{as long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{... in the garden?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{that is correct. in a garden, growth has its season. there is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. and then spring and summer again...}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(staring at chance)}
<D>__{... spring and summer...}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{yes, i see... fall and winter.}
<P>__{(smiles at chance)}
<D>__{yes, indeed...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{could you go through that one more time, please, mr. gardiner?}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{i think what my most insightful friend is saying, mr. president, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. that is correct.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{...well, mr. gardiner, i must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements i've heard in a very, very long time.}
<A>__{the president puts out his cigarette, rises.}
<C>__{president }
<D>__{... many of us forget that nature and society are one! yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it! like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational. and that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy!}
<P>__{(he smiles at chance, who}
<D>__{is absorbed in looking around the room at the}
<P>__{books)}
<D>__{... i envy your good, solid sense, mr. gardiner that is precisely what we lack on capitol hill.}
<P>__{(glances at watch)}
<D>__{i must be going.}
<P>__{(holds out hand to chance)}
<D>__{mr. gardiner, this visit has been enlightening...}
<A>__{chance rises and shakes the president's hand.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it has.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{... you will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i will.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.}
<P>__{(turns to rand)}
<D>__{is eve around? i'd like to say hello.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{no, she flew up to boston for another charity event. she'll be sorry to have missed you.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{i'm sorry, too. well, nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you and, ben, i want to thank you for your time and thoughts.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{nonsense, mr. president i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{now, ben, i won't have any of that. why don't you listen to your good friend chauncey this is a time to think of life!}
<A>__{the president clasps rand's hand.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{you're right, mr. president i don't like feeling sorry for myself.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{take care of yourself, ben.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{you take care too, bobby.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(as he turns to go, a smile to chance)}
<D>__{mr. gardiner...}
<A>__{the president leaves the library and chance sits back down.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(as the door closes)}
<D>__{he's a decent fellow, the president, isn't he?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, ben he is.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{he was quite impressed with your comments, chauncey he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately seldom if ever at all.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i'm glad he came, ben. it was nice talking to the president.}
