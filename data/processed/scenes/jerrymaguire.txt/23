<L>__{interior smi office day}
<A>__{elevator doors open. maguire is now paranoid. he walks through the buzzing smi headquarters, heading for his corner office. he is like an fbi man searching treetops and corners for the gunman. everywhere he looks is a potential grassy knoll. he passes fellow agents, always smiling, giving a word of encouragement to an agent having an emotional hallway conversation with an athlete, even bends down to check the sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated basketball player. moving forward. there is trouble in the air, but only he seems to sense it. he turns corner and is met by assistant wendy, who hands him a long list of calls. the sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward his back office.}
