<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{george opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. he closes the door behind him. the room has a ghostly quality to it. jack sniffs about everywhere. george too seems troubled by the strange pervading atmosphere. his curiosity is spurred by a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. a ray of light surges into the room. the door has opened and, standing against the daylight, is a maid. title card: you should go back to your room, sir. george nods with a smile. the maid leaves pretty swiftly, we haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange. george is intrigued but leaves the room. he has to call jack to him. jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.}
