<L>__{exterior indy's dig night}
<A>__{in the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, indy and the other men step back in awe of their discovery: there, flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy stone entry door to an underground chamber. special prying tools are produced. with two men assigned to each of the two long tools, they work in unison to open the vault. they open it a foot and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely open. down inside, only blackness. the men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the entry to look inside. indy and sallah each take a torch and hold them down the hole.}
<B>__{what they see}
<A>__{the well of the souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep. the walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings. the roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars, the closest of which hits the roof very near the entry hole. the well is quite large; as indy and sallah wave their torches, more and more of the room is revealed. now the far end of the chamber comes into view. there is a stone altar down there and on this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest, big enough to enclose the lost ark and protect it from the ravages of time. this altar appears to be the only place on the floor of the well that is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of some kind.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the ark must be in that stone case. what's that gray stuff all over the floor }
<A>__{he breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is. he blanches. indiana jones blanches. indy drops his torch to the floor of the well. this is answered by the most horrific hissing imaginable.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{that think dark carpet is moving. it's alive. it's thousands and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes egyptian asps. and the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this venomous groundcover is the altar. the snakes ebb and flow near it, but never encroach on it, as though repelled by some invisible force. indy shakes his head and talks to himself.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{why snakes? why did it have to be snakes? anything else.}
<A>__{after a moment of this, he stops. he gathers his energy and resolve and gets back to the task.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{asps. very dangerous.}
<A>__{where indy's torch had landed is a circle of snake free floor. the snakes hate the flame; they stay away.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{lots of torches. and oil. i want a landing strip down there.}
