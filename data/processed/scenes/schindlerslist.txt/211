<L>__{exterior brinnlitz camp day}
<A>__{like a mirage in the distance they appear the women, the children, guards, schindler, marching across a field toward the factory. at the perimeter of the camp, at the wire, the men watch the approaching procession. it appears to them that the women are covered in blood or could it be paint? they're walking, they're fine, some are even smiling. liepold isn't smiling. neither is schindler; at least not on the outside.}
