<A>__{...and she sails down the hallway, setting fire to everything she passes, screaming for the final torment to end. she hurls herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she plummets to the floor far below. a pillar of flame leaps up on impact. victor and the creature face each other as flames sweep the walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in hell.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you killed her! you killed her!}
<A>__{he hurls himself at the creature, who backhands him spinning down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. the creature gazes down at his maker one last time...}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{we killed her.}
<A>__{and then vanishes through the smoke and flames.}
