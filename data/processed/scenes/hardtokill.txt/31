<D>__{i'm sorry ... sorry }
<A>__{trent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away, in the direction of where o'malley is. holland goes the opposite way. the reporter picks up her v.o.:}

<C>__{o'malley}
<P>__{(whisper, full of menace)}
<D>__{let me tell you something, you piss ant. that man in there was the cleanest i ever knew with more honor and guts than this whole department put together. if i ever hear you say fuck all like that again, i will lose my shield to put you where you belong.}
