<A>__{watters is once again on her cellphone to lorenzo.}
<C>__{wyman }
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{so everything's cool then?}
<C>__{watters}
<D>__{we sat down with padiche, he tried to get some details which we wasn't gonna give up, but it's all good. we goin' check sis in first, 'fore i check in across the street.}
<A>__{sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators open and israel's hookers, post brawl bruised, bloodied and barefoot, come staggering out. they slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled. sykes trades looks with watters as if assessing something, nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. watters then winks, something sexual there...it gives sykes the shivers. the hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and summarily whisked away. watters joins sykes. the woman behind the counter checking sykes in, looks up to see watters.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{will you be needing a room with two double beds?}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{no, we're not together.}
<A>__{watters, a grin.}
<C>__{watters}
<D>__{c'mon baby, don't be shy.}
<C>__{watters }
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{just one bed please.}
<P>__{(beat, to sykes smiling)}
<D>__{although if we sweat that one up, we goin' need some clean sheets.}
<P>__{(as sykes pulls away)}
<D>__{c'mon girl, you know i'm playing!}
<A>__{sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman, who keeps her eyes locked on the computer in front of her.}
<C>__{watters }
<P>__{(over her shoulder to the departing hookers)}
<D>__{..if ya'll let hoochie like that stay up in here, ya'll must be burning sheets by the ton.}
<A>__{the woman just smiles that monstrously insincere "i'm here to help!" smile, offering nothing in response.}
<C>__{watters }
<D>__{you just goin' grin? y'ain't goin comment on that, at all? trampy ass skeezers, doin' damage they ain't even smart enough to see. that don't gall you at all?}
<P>__{(beat, closer)}
<D>__{bitches like those are the same ones runnin' feminism right to the brink girl. bitches like that the reason mafuckas don't take our species seriously. we jus' meat for male consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass and pussy, somethin' pretty in lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.}
<A>__{sykes, embarrassed, nudging watters, knock it off...}
<D>__{watters (contd) (cont'd) bitches like that make me weep for what could be if we could all, sisters everywhere, black, white, yellow and brown, put our shit down one time, unified front, the force of the female race, mobilized, moving as one...}
<A>__{the woman, smile severely strained, the pro feminist diatribe falling on decidedly deaf ears. an awkward beat, then;}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i'm gonna need a mini bar key too.}
