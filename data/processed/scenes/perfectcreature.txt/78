<L>__{int: lilly's apartment day}
<A>__{we track through lilly's apartment, silently. we enter the lounge to see lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange looking valve powered globular television like device. we track ominously up behind her. then stop.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{i knocked.}
<A>__{lilly turns to jones.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you nearly gave me a heart attack.}
<A>__{steph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t shirt and shorts and carrying some food. jones looks at her coldly.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what's this then?}
<A>__{lilly and steph smile at the inference jones is beginning to draw.}
<C>__{steph}
<D>__{my apartment was condemned, keep your hair on, what's left of it.}
<A>__{meanwhile lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray images emitting from the television.}
<C>__{tv presenter}
<D>__{...the ascension through the ranks of the church has been fast for brother silus. he will now be the highest ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the brotherhood. this is largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza pandemic.}
<A>__{jones and lilly watch as silus is seen on the television in an interview. steph stares at the screen with awe, she involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain around her neck; it resembles a brother's ring.}
<C>__{steph}
<D>__{isn't he amazing?}
<A>__{jones sneers under his breath.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{a sainterior}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{quiet.}
<A>__{we move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and white tv screen.}
<C>__{tv presenter}
<D>__{you have been an opponent of those who want an easing in the ban on genetic research.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{tv presenter}
<D>__{they would say you're denying legitimate research into a science that would change the world.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{the church does not deny the potential. only the motivations of those who want to exploit it. and the fact that we understand so little of its power.}
<C>__{tv presenter}
<D>__{with the elimination of influenza, are we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past?}
<A>__{as she is saying this we are now close on the tv's speaker. we then begin tracking out. we reveal the speaker is not part of the tv, but the speaker in edgar's cell. edgar, smiling coldly as he listens. as he listens he is gently gliding his finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening them.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{disease is part of nature, it will always be a part of our lives.}
<A>__{close on edgar.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{how true.}
<C>__{tv presenter}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{brother silus' confirmation ceremony will be held today in the sacred chapel of st. augustine where all the brotherhood will gather.}
<A>__{edgar listens, smiles.}
