<A>__{with a neatly tended garden. it is the last house on a street of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond it the street disappears down a bluff. the empty space beyond suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an anchored, gaudily painted paddle boat poking over the rise. the paddle boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of the river. mrs. munson is entering by the gate. she stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers. i e. munson house foyer day mrs. munson lets herself in. a cat lopes up to her, the bell around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg.}
