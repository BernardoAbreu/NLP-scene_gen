<A>__{eli is crouched beneath the window. george and martha have taken up positions at other windows, peering out.}
<C>__{redridge }
<D>__{that's all we want. the girl and the book. the rest of you's can go your way.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<A>__{beat as eli thinks.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hand me my pack.}
<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{redridge waits. still no sign of a response. his nervous gunmen exchange worried looks.}
<D>__{carnegie gunman #2 they ain't comin' out. they }
<A>__{redridge raises his hand to silence him. looks up as an upstairs window slides open. a cloth package is tossed from the window. it lands in the dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from redridge. cautiously, he approaches. the package is wrapped in cloth and tied up with twine. it looks like eli's bible. he picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. folds away the cloth wrapping. looks for a moment in puzzlement at the object, at the words written on the front of it.}
<B>__{this side to face enemy}
<A>__{it's a miniature claymore mine. the small red light on top of the unit illuminates with a beep. armed.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{holy shi...}
<A>__{he drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back toward the vehicles.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{get down! everybody get down!}
<A>__{he dives across the trunk of the explorer into cover as the mine explodes, shattering every window of every vehicle. the lightweight mini cooper takes the main brunt and explodes, cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck. redridge looks around. three men lie dead already. flaming wreckage all around him. suddenly, it's a war zone. machine gun fire erupts from the house, peppering the vehicles' armor. the gunmen cower behind cover.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{damn you, return fire!}
<A>__{redridge aims at the house and opens fire. inspired by his example, the others follow. a hail of bullets criss cross back and forth. the house's faded paint facade is shredded.}
