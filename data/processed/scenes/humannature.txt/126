<L>__{interior lab day}
<A>__{nathan hovers over the lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it. his assistant, gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in. the male pulls out a chair for the female. the female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. the lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. nathan scribbles in his notebook.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{doctor...}
<A>__{nathan looks up. gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large lucite case. inside, puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. nathan and gabrielle hurry over.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{puff groggily takes in his surroundings. this is quite a lot to take in. the white room, the strange apes in strange suits, his own clothing, the wires. after surveying the scene for a moment, puff becomes frightened and agitated. he tries to escape. not understanding lucite, he smashes into it, again and again. he tears at his diaper. nathan gives a nod to gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel. an electric shock sends puff flying. he lies on the floor confused and dazed. after a moment, he gets up and again crashes into the lucite. nathan gives the signal to gabrielle and once again she shocks puff. he once again gets up and crashes against the lucite. again he is shocked. he gets up again, and is about to crash against the lucite, but he thinks better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.}
