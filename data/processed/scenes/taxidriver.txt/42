<A>__{early evening, about 6:30 p.m. travis' taxi, with 'off duty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown manhattan. travis runs his hand down the left side of his jacket, attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath. travis opens his jacket partially, checking underneath. there rests the nickel plated .38 special in its holster. p.o.v. down the street where travis' taxi is parked: several blocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters of charles palantine are visible. travis' eyes resume their watch. travis starts the car and drives toward the palantine}

<A>__{tracking p.o.v. shot of row of storefronts leading up to palantine headquarters. p.o.v. passes headquarters: it is half empty. a few stalwart supporters continue to work toward the rear of the office. betsy's desk sign in window reads: "only 4 more days until arrival of charles palantine." travis' "off duty" light goes off as he speeds up and heads toward a prospective fare. later that night, about 9:30. uptown 128th and amsterdam. the jungle. travis' taxi pulls up to an address, lets off}
<B>__{young black man.}
<A>__{travis receives fare and tip, takes off. p.o.v. as travis works his way through harlem back down seventh ave. cluster of young black street punks pretend to hail cab we ignore them. one throws wine bottle which crashes in our path taxi swerves to avoid it. camera tracks through sidewalk crowds with the roving, suspicious, antagonistic eye of a taxi driver. later that night, about 12:30. travis is on the lower east side, somewhere on b street, east of tompkins square. the sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once was the hippie movement: teenage street walkers, junkies, thugs, emaciated loners on the prowl. travis' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare. travis pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't slam instead there is the sound of another person jumping into the cab. travis checks the back seat in the rear view mirror: there sits a pale hippie prostitute. the girl is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made up to look older. she wears floppy, janis joplin clothes. her face is pallid. she wears large blue tinted sunglasses and multi colored leg stockings. her name, as we shall learn later, is iris. travis hesitates, looking at her in the mirror.}

<D>__{come on, baby, let's go. this is all a real drag.}
<A>__{iris lets herself be taken out of the cab. the rear door closes. sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something on the front seat. travis looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill.}
<C>__{sport}
<D>__{just forget all about this, cabbie. it's nothing.}
<A>__{travis cannot see the sport's face lime green completely, but notices he is wearing a jacket. the voice is that of a man in his early twenties. travis turns to catch a glimpse of sport as he walks off with iris. travis shrugs and turns around. travis' taxi pulls away.}
