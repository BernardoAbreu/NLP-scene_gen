<L>__{interior charles rickman's office day}
<A>__{where we suddenly find ourselves lost in some bright flickering space, filled with the sound of static. abruptly, the static vanishes, the flickering space congeals and we realize that we are watching a television screen. and as we pull back, we realize that we are seeing a news report on from snn (satellite news network). we are in charles's office. he's there watching this new report. images of what appear to be a terrible explosion fill the frame (stock footage from a terrorist attack in london perhaps?) cars on fire, imploded building, panic in the street, etc... the door opens and his assistant betty comes in. she watches charles for a moment.)}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i just talked to the police. still, nothing. she's just gone. left her hotel, left her clothes, left her money. no sign of her anywhere.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{see no amy. hear no amy...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just like marla chen. apartment just left empty. no trace. the police say its to early to file an official report.}
<P>__{(off his concerned look)}
<D>__{do you think they she with foul play?}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(off the tv) i don't know, i just don't}
<D>__{know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{too bad, too. it would have made a hell}
<P>__{of a story. (beat)}
<D>__{i'm sure she'll come walking in here any minute, carrying with her my story.}
<A>__{charles watches the report on the tv. pandemonium in the streets.}
<D>__{it's a hell of a story, too. it just gets better and better. and it looks like i just may need somebody else crazy enough to go get it.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{maybe you have. your three o'clock's here.}
<A>__{betty leans her head out of the room signalling someone out in the hall to come in. a young bombshell reporter enters, holds out her hand to charles who suddenly perks up as he takes it and leads her to the couch. as he does we move past charles and the young reporter to the tv. a reporter reports live from the scene of a terrible explosion in }
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{bucharest, romania.}
<A>__{over the continuing images of this destroyed building, surrounded by police cars and fire trucks , the sirens blaring over all the confusion,s charles courts the reporter.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{miss turner. it's a pleasure to meet you welcome you to our team. let's cut right to it, shall we. i received this tape which i would like to show you...and well, i think it's a story you could really wrap your head around. i hope your willing to do so...}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{witnesses say the building, located at the corner of poteilari and minvara just imploded. firefighters have been on the scene for several hours now. sources say the only thing that seemed to survive the collapse of the building was a this, (she holds up the puzzle box) this small relic, found incredibly, undamaged.}
<A>__{we move past the image of the puzzlebox on the tv and settle on the framed photograph of amy and charles in happier times smiling. probably the first time we've seen a smile on amy's face since the last time we've seen this picture. we get a sense that maybe she's finally at peace.}
