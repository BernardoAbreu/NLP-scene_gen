<L>__{interior med lab annex}
<A>__{in a small observation chamber separated from the med lab by a glass partition, ripley and burke have squared off.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division. now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. set up for life.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine. section 22350 of the commerce code.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you've been doing your homework. look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{but they will know about it, burke. from me. just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here }
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{now, wait a second }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(stepping on him)}
<D>__{you sent them to that ship. i just checked the colony log... directive dates six twelve seventy nine. signed burke, carter j.}
<A>__{ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and rage finally have a target to focus on.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, burke. why didn't you warn them?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? and if i'd made it a major security situation, the administration would've stepped in. then no exclusive rights, nothing.}
<A>__{he shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it was a bad call, that's all.}
<A>__{ripley snaps. she slams him against the wall, surprising herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bad call? these people are fucking dead, burke! well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and i will be there when they do.}
<A>__{she steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far more horrific revelation than any alien.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i expected more of you, ripley. i thought you would be smarter than this.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{sorry to disappoint you.}
<A>__{she turns away and strides out. the door closes. burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.}
