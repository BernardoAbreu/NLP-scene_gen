<L>__{exterior countryside day}
<A>__{clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes. they've taken position on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of}
<B>__{the path to the pet sematary.}
<L>__{38 exterior pet sematary path day}
<A>__{geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys. he dismounts and leans it up against a tree.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{just give me the cat, all right?}
<A>__{a devilish grin creeps over clyde. he strolls down the path toward geoff. clyde grabs geoff's handlebars and, backing up, pulls geoff and the bike with him.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i would but... there was a little accident...}
<P>__{(feeding off geoff's alarm)}
<D>__{she was trying to get away. you know, running down my leg... and her head got too close to the spokes. pretty gross. what's left of her is up in the pet sematary. a zip lock bag might help...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{...but i happen to be out of them at the moment.}
<A>__{drew shakes his head, disgusted he has to put up with clyde's antics.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{come on, clyde, just tell him where the cat is...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(turning on drew)}
<D>__{...i told him where the cat is! now shut up, fuck face!}
<A>__{clyde punches drew in the arm. drew shrinks back. geoff flashes a hateful stare at clyde. all of the boys but clyde are uncomfortably silent. there's something frightening about clyde... something that extends beyond the standard bully antics. we begin to get the feeling that this kid is genuinely deranged.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(relishing the moment)}
<D>__{you heard about the creed murders yet? and the place where the dead come back to life?}
<A>__{he motions to the path behind him.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's just back there. just down that path...}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(meekly)}
<D>__{clyde... it's not funny anymore.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh? so you got a problem? what're you gonna do, fat ass? you gonna sic big, bad, old gus after me?}
<A>__{drew shuts up. clyde turns back to geoff, drawing closer.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what do you think, geoff? maybe you could dig up your mom and take her back there. maybe if you pray real hard, she'll come back.}
<A>__{with this last remark clyde has pushed too far. geoff's face is red with anger.}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{just give me the cat, ass hole.}
<A>__{clyde's grin falters a moment.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{excuse me, maybe i'm a little hard of hearing... but did you just call me an ass hole?}
<A>__{clyde pokes geoff in the shoulder.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you mad, geoff? cause if you are, you should take a shot at me...}
<A>__{this time clyde shoves geoff back even harder.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{come on, you pussy! what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{clyde moves forward again and geoff suddenly lashes out, catching everyone off guard. for an instant, drew marvels at geoff's tenacity. clyde lunges. he hammers geoff with blows. outsizing him by forty pounds, clyde tosses geoff to the ground. geoff struggles, but clyde's grip proves arresting. clyde throws geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the dirt. it looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent. drew is the first to rush in. brad and stevie quickly follow. it takes all three of them to peel clyde off geoff. clyde gets to his feet and backs away. there's great pleasure in his crazed eyes as he watches geoff coughing and gasping.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{fuckin' ass hole.}
<A>__{satisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, clyde turns away. drew's attentions remain on geoff. as clyde strolls by, he grabs drew's arm and swings him around.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{this way, fat boy.}
<A>__{stevie and brad follow. as the group passes geoff's bike, clyde gives it a kick, knocking it over. then they're gone. geoff pulls himself to his feet. brushing off the mess, he heads up the path in search of tiger.}
