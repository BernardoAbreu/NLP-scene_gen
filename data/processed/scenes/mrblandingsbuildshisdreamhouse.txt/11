<L>__{interior the closet}
<A>__{this is a fairly good sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not jim and muriel blandings. assuming that they had started out on even terms, it is now obviously muriel, three to one. her dresses, gowns, slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit or sports coat. her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance. groping blindly for a robe, jim feels around and pulls one out. as he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small for him, obviously muriel's. in disgust he attempts to put it back. unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor. as he bends down and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor. he drags the robe out and dons it, leaving the dresses where they fell. with a guilty look at muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall.}
