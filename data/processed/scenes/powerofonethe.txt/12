<A>__{the six year old walks timorously through the halls, filled with bigger boys brash, noisy, hostile. they only speak the "taal" afrikaans. over and over they jostle or verbally deride the six year old, knocking his books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is kicked in the butt. or pulling his shirt out from under his jacket and making it hard to move.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{i spoke only english. the hated tongue. the language of the enemy who had usurped power and stolen the country through political chicanery and military brutality.}
<A>__{a mob of boys, led by a big bully, jaapie botha, runs the six year old through the bathroom and into the showers, fully clothed. he tries to run out. jaapie botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with one ham fisted hand under the shower head and turning the shower on with the other. the six year old stands miserable as the stinging water pelts him.}

<D>__{during the boer war of 1896, 26,000 boer women and children were herded into detainment camps by the british, where they died like flies from dysentery, malaria and black water fever. and it seemed i was destined to shoulder the responsibility for each and every one of those deaths.}
<A>__{the six year old in his first soccer game receives the ball. he tries to move upfield, but he is kicked and pushed, the ball taken from him. he gets up gamely to follow the chase, only to be flattened, blindsided by jaapie botha.}

<D>__{and no one made this more evident to me than jaapie botha, a wheat farmer's son from the transvaal.}
