<L>__{exterior south park avenue day}
<A>__{birds fly into the air, townspeople smile to each other as they walk by. it is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off from, the opening number of 'beauty and the beast'. a little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. he is stan marsh, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin. as he walks, he sings a happy song.}

<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{yeah! you're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches!}
<A>__{the boys' parents walk up.}

<C>__{kenny's dad}
<D>__{this is all so wonderful. i just wish our little kenny could see all of this joy.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{oh he can, dude. look!}
<A>__{kyle points to the sky. everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky. we follow the shooting star and then slowly zoom in on it. as we get closer, we realize it is actually kenny, shooting towards the heavens. as triumphant music plays, kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (note: this will also be done in 3 d cgi) rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness. angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. they smile gently. he feels calm. he feels good. amidst a group of angels, kenny flies upwards and finally... into heaven.}
