<L>__{exterior passageway night}
<A>__{finnegan leads them single file, they quickly head into a shaking narrow void. fear has led to silence, and unbearable tension. the walls on either side creak, and moan with strange noises.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{mid hull night finnegan quickly comes out of the creaking, moaning gangway, followed by the others. all the strange noises suddenly stop. everything gets quiet. finnegan freezes. something's wrong. everybody looks around. steam shoots out from multiple pipes. the air is thick with mist.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{the quiet...}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{maybe we lost them.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.}
<A>__{finnegan moves on. the others follow. guns out front. tense. they round a huge metal pillar and come face to face with a soul wrenching nightmare. the creatures' nest or stomach. across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge gelatinous womb. imagine a massive thick wall of clear yellow jell o, with hundreds of blue veins running through it. if it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered beautiful. inside the womb, a dozen humans, passengers, float around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living dead. they all seem to be breathing the gelatin. several tentacles wriggle through the stuff; which divides and re forms in some sort of strange mitosis. finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified. but even more horrifying is that the people can look back at them. many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. trillian looks sick, trembles in fear.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{a meat locker.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{we can't just leave them here.}
<A>__{canton looks like he's about to throw up, he starts backing away, heading for a side hatch.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{i can.}
<A>__{in the womb, a tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young lady. the lady tries to back pedal away, but because of the gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only move in slow motion. the feelers grip her naked thigh. she tries to scream, but her face is already starting to constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed. pantucci is so horrified he's about to cry.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{oh no...oh god please no.}
<A>__{the tentacle sac gloms onto the lady's forehead. through the sac we can see her skin melting. the only thing she can move are her eyes, which are bugging out in absolute horror as she is imbibed alive. our heroes are frozen in fear. until the lady's eyes liquefy. trillian burries her head in finnegan's shoulder, trying to shut out the horror.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{we can't do anything for them... let's go...}
<A>__{he begins to lead her toward the hatch...when her eyes recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair. the old lady seems to see her too. her hands read out, imploring. her mouth silently shapes the words: help me! just as a tentacle comes creeping toward her.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{nooo!!}
<A>__{her rage rises. she hefts her rifle, and starts blasting away.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{you won't get her!! you won't!!}
<A>__{spitting flames and smoke. the bullets impact the gelatin. blasting it away. but the bullets only manage to go about twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop. gelatin explodes all over the place. tracer holes streak through the stuff. but all the bullets are sliding short.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{finnegan...do something!! please!!}
<A>__{finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling where most of the tentacles are coming from. their long tails wiggle down from a massive clutter of pipes. a bas relief of horror. finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades off hanover's utility belt.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{finnegan, no!!!}
<A>__{...bites the pins and spits them out.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{eat this.}
<A>__{he chucks the grenades up into the strange writhing fresco, safely clear of the passengers.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{fire in the hole!}
<A>__{pantucci and hanover throw themselves to the floor. finnegan pulls trillian down, covering her. ba woom! gelatin sprays everywhere.}
