<A>__{rose splashes water on her face. norah walks in and leans against the counter. rose makes no sign of acknowledgement. norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{winston cleans up pretty good.}
<A>__{rose isn't biting. she doesn't even look at norah. she leans past norah and gets her own paper towel. norah tries again.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. like having eyes the same size and all that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.}
<A>__{rose won't play. she dabs her face and ignores norah. norah walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{listen, i know i fucked up, okay? like really huge and i know that and i'm sorry, okay?}
<A>__{it's a bullshit apology. more defensive than sincere. just the thing that pushes rose's buttons.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{god, that drives me crazy! that whole `oh, i'm sorry, i'm just a big fuck up' routine. like that's a legitimate excuse.}
<A>__{norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. she steps towards rose. this is hard for her. sincerity is not her strong suit.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i really am sorry. but it really isn't all my fault, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i think there's something wrong with you. the way your brain works. i mean, what the hell? it's like you can't be trusted with anything. you just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. it wasn't a game, norah. we're not all just here for your amusement. you should have been paying attention. you should have been focused on the job.}
<A>__{rose finally hears herself. it's all the same old stuff. she grinds to a stop. she knows it wasn't all norah's fault.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{you finished?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i know. i should have been there.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{what are you going to do now?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i got some ideas. i was thinking maybe we could }
<A>__{norah shakes her head.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i've got my own ideas.}
<A>__{rose nods. as they exit, she turns to norah.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{so, you really think he's hot?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{winston? no.}
