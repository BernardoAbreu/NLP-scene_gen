<L>__{interior the scene. take five. the improv}
<A>__{nicole stays seated, though palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've always admired you from afar.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{have you? that's, wow; that's incredible. but that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? admired?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you're right. how does despised sound?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{great!}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what's it mean?}
<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's sort of like i think you're a piece of shit.}
<A>__{palomino is somewhat startled by this. he looks to nick in confusion. nick silently encourages him to keep going.}
<C>__{palomino}
<P>__{(another laugh)}
<D>__{that sounds like the champagne talking.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's not. i really do think you are a piece of shit.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{no, you don't. you love me.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{the fuck i do. i can't stand looking at you!}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{then i guess i have nothing else to say.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no, i think you have a lot more to say, damian.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{well, i am surprised you feel this way, ellen. i always thought you admired }
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{that's not what i meant. you should tell everyone what you just told nick behind the set.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, this isn't part of the scene.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{say it anyway: the reason this scene isn't working is because you and i slept together last night. did everyone hear that?! i fucked chad last night!}
<A>__{nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{see, nick! i told you this was about rejection!}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you fucking scumbag! you think i give a rat's ass about you?! i was there to get laid and even that was a joke!}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{you know, you are really starting to piss me off!}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit!}
<A>__{palomino snaps, and lunges for nicole. she leaps to the other side of the bed.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{come on! i will kick your ass! come on!}
<A>__{nick steps between nicole and palomino.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ok, guys, i think we can stop there.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{you bet your ass we can stop! wanda, call me a cab!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hold on, chad. let's just try to calm down.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{fuck you. i'm out of here, man. this movie is bullshit.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{now wait a second, chad. there's no reason for hostility.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{shut up, you fucking loser. the only reason i took this part was because someone said you knew quentin tarantino! you're nowhere, man.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, you want to go? go! i'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker!}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{what'd you call me?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{say it again.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you hostess twinkie motherfucker!}
<A>__{palomino suddenly punches nick in the stomach, leaving him bent over and gasping for breath. nicole instantly leaps on palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head. palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as wanda rushes forward.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{alright, everyone just stop. stop! stop this right now!}
<A>__{as she tries to separate nicole and palomino, palomino shoves her hard, knocking her down. instantly wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to palomino.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{alright, you've asked for it, chad!}
<A>__{palomino suddenly punches wolf in the teeth, dropping him like a stone.}
<C>__{wanda}
<P>__{(shrieks)}
<D>__{wolf!}
<A>__{suddenly nick staggers to his feet and rushes at palomino. his momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, palomino's head cracking nicole in the teeth.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{nicole rolls free as nick and palomino wrestle on the bed. nick gets palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding his head against the mattress.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you want to pick my brain?! this is the way i direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you!}
<A>__{as nick continues to pound palomino's head the gaffer notices palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of nick's forearm around his neck. he and the boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry palomino free.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{get him out of here! someone take him back to his hotel!}
<A>__{as the gaffer and boom man drag off the almost unconscious palomino, the scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.}
<C>__{script}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{chad...}
<A>__{suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for nick's labored breathing and the scriptgirl's sniffles. nick leans over and touches nicole's shoulder.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{don't touch me.}
