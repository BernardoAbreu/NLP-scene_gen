<A>__{begin on black. the sound of rain driving into trees. something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild eyed, kilted john brown. drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and right, as he searches the lightening dark. a crack to his left. he spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past saplings and plunges on.}
<L>__{exterior the grounds of windsor castle, forest night}
<A>__{close up on brown as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air. a face in its fifties, mad fierce eyes, handsome, bruised lips, liverish. he goes on searching the dark. stops. listens through the rain. a beat. thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and races on.}
<L>__{exterior the grounds of windsor castle, forest night}
<A>__{brown tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder. but even now there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace. he leaps fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes forward, never stumbling once.}
<L>__{exterior the grounds of windsor castle, forest night}
<A>__{brown bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops. with his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle. his eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees. there's a crack and a branch snaps behind him. he spins round, bellows deep from his heart:}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{god save the queen!!}
<A>__{and fires. nothing happens. the trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and brown just stands there, staring into empty space. a pause. slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone. he stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him. his hand lets the pistol drop to his side. he feels the rain drench down his face. and now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds. he shifts a foot. his dress shoes are covered in mud. he goes on staring into the dark. nothing. just the wind and rain. gradually, we pull back, higher and higher. as we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:}

<C>__{brown }
<D>__{honest to god, i never thought to see you in such a state. you must miss him dreadfully.}

<A>__{some minutes later, brown is angrily unpacking a trunk. his humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary ferocity with which he slams down every object. his younger brother, archie, sits on the bed. he's in his early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed.}
<C>__{archie}
<P>__{(telling it fast)}
<D>__{so the day they arrive, she greets the sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber. the sultan, not used to state occasions without a head of state, is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do. but the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him, not a living soul, for the whole afternoon. so now it's dinner and everyone's standing round the table still not a word waiting for her majesty to arrive. one hour goes by, two, the sultan's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least. so finally, his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth. well, the uproar when she heard. you'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels.}

<D>__{i speak as i find, archie.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{not down south you don't.}
<A>__{brown slams a drawer shut. archie lets it go and watches his brother. a beat.}
<C>__{archie }
