<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{between cars, brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black mustang. laura goes to him and speaks quickly. the dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. laura says something to him. grunting something angrily, he gets in the car with the bald kid and peels off. laura turns and slowly walks towards the house. when she is gone brendan stands, throws a look back at the house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.}
