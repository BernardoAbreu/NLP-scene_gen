<L>__{interior engineer workshop continuous}
<A>__{whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of post apocalyptic radio shack. shelves display a variety of goods. engine parts. old electrical wiring. small appliances. an old electric generator rumbles noisily, powering strings of multi colored christmas lights that hang all around. behind the main counter a convoluted rube goldberg esque still is running. an engineer in a leather apron pours the remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel. attached to the still is an old motorcycle mirror. in its reflection the engineer sees eli checking out the store. without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the counter for something. eli turns toward the counter to find the engineer training a pump action shotgun right at him.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{i don't know you.}
<A>__{eli slowly raises his hands.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not from around here.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{no shit. who are you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm just a customer.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{a customer with a shotgun?}
<A>__{he nods toward the shotgun visible on eli's backpack.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you come in here to rip me off?}
<A>__{the engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the trigger. this man needs to be talked down carefully.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no. i will set it down. okay?}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{slowly!}
<A>__{eli nods. unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you carry a gun in the outland, you don't bring one into town less you live there. don't you know that?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i forgot. i've been on the road a long time.}
<A>__{this seems to make the engineer more suspicious of eli.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{show me your hand.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not a }
<A>__{the engineer jerks the shotgun at eli nervously.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{i said show me your fucking hand!}
<A>__{eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced downward. the engineer watches it closely for any sign of ticks or tremors, but eli's hand stays steady as a rock.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not one of them.}
<A>__{the sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a little. finally, he lowers the shotgun.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm just passing through. i need some help. i can pay.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{what kinda help? and what kinda pay?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm going to get something out of my pack. okay?}
<A>__{the engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i know, i know. slowly.}
<A>__{the engineer watches him like a hawk as eli opens up his pack and pulls out the car battery. when he sees it, he gasps.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{eli places it on the counter. the engineer looks it over with awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{where'd you find this?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{years ago, in the outland back east aways.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{does it work?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah, it just needs a charge. can you do it? i got the cables.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{depends if you also got the coin.}
<A>__{eli pulls the zippo lighter from his pocket. the engineer picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{it'll take a couple hours. there's a bar across the street you can wait, they just opened up.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i will wait here.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you don't trust me?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't know you.}
