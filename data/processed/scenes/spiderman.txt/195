<A>__{a waldo reaches in and rips roz off spidey, flinging him back against a wall. roz lands in a heap beneath a fire station (hose, extinguisher, axe). we see the waldo reach out for spider man. it wraps around his foot and begins to tug, slowly...}

<D>__{once and for all, spider man... once and for all we'll end the legend of your powers.}
<A>__{ock knocks spider man with a real big blow with his waldo. ock is slowly dragging spider man to a huge hole that's been ripped in the floor by the beams of electricity. we see new york a half a mile down through the hole. we see spidey being drawn across the hole. then roz comes flying in with the fire axe. roz hacks away at the waldo and chops it off! the stump withdraws. ock examines it in pain and fury!}

<D>__{you!! you were my teacher!!!}
<A>__{roz doesn't even look back. he and spidey are at the edge of the hole and he's shaking spidey furiously. ock sends out his other waldo and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of roz and spidey. like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again.}

<C>__{roz}
<D>__{yes, but not on account of our world. we have only one world... only one life. the floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. bang! bang! spidey comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and roz gives way and falls through.}
<A>__{spidey grabs hold of the edge and dangles. he looks down and sees roz falling away beneath him, disappearing into the dark.}
