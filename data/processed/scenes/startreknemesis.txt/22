<L>__{interior argo cargo bay following}
<A>__{picard slams on the brakes the jeep screeches to a stop as the doors shut and the argo shoots into the air. picard climbs from the jeep. he nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin. data and worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{he must have klingon blood.}
<L>__{interior enterprise engineering lab day}
<A>__{beverly gazes at the android head. it gazes back at her.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i think you have nicer eyes.}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal she is speaking to data. data stands with picard, riker and geordi.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{our eyes are identical, doctor.}
<A>__{the android is in a framework rig that holds the various body parts in place. the parts are not yet assembled}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{geordi?}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(at work analyzing the torso section)}
<D>__{well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic development. the neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. i'd say he's a prototype. something dr. soong created before data.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to head)}
<D>__{do you have a name, sir?}
<C>__{head}
<D>__{i am the b 9.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{be nign. dr. soong's penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end.}
<C>__{head}
<P>__{(to riker)}
<D>__{you have a fuzzy face.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(trying to ignore the head)}
<D>__{keep me informed, number one, and, please, put him back together.}
<A>__{he goes. geordi and data begin to reassemble the b 9 piece by piece like the tin man as:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you? b 9}
<P>__{(blandly)}
<D>__{i was taken from my homeworld by people called the "pakjeds." they are fat. they traded me to a ship belonging to the "bolians." the "bolians" are blue. they put me in a seat and asked me questions. then they were attacked by another ship...}
<A>__{time passes... and still the b 9 is yammering blandly away. he is more fully assembled by this time beverly is thoroughly bored.}
<D>__{b 9 then people called the delviciansans picked me up. they have long teeth. they asked if i do anything to help them. i told them i could do whatever they wanted. they asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds. i told them i did not know what an matrix manifold looks like.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{excuse me. i have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things.}
<A>__{she quickly exits.}
<D>__{b 9 and after they showed me the "engine manifolds." then they showed me something called a "plasma mop"}
<A>__{time passes... and still the b 9 is yammering away. he is almost completely assembled by now. riker is bored out of his mind.}
<D>__{b 9 ... then the "cardassians" put me into something called a "garbage chute" and i went out into space again worf (v.o.) (on comm) worf to commander riker. i have the tactical manifests ready, sir.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(quickly tapping his comm badge)}
<D>__{worf! wonderful! i will be right there!...}
<P>__{(he stands)}
<D>__{duty calls, gentlemen. carry on.}
<A>__{he escapes.}
<D>__{b 9 fuzzy face is gone.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes, please continue. b 9 i was in space for a long time. then a ship belonging to the "talosians" picked me up. they asked me where i came from. i told them people called the "pakleds" took me from my homeworld. they are fat...}
<A>__{geordi groans. time passes... and still the b 9 is yammering away. by this time geordi is slumped in a chair and only data is listening. the b 9 is fully assembled.}
<D>__{b 9 then i opened my eyes and saw you.}
<A>__{a beat. the b 9 is finally done with his tale...}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{do you know who i am? b 9 you are me.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no. my name is data... i am your brother.}
