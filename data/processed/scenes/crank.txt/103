<A>__{“everybody’s talking” by harry nilsson begins. chev cruises in an out of traffic and people like a sunday drive, ignoring traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians. (we speed ramp about 20% to the beat of the song an undercrank of about 18fps.) he’s so jacked up and delusional he decides to try a bare assed “elevator” on the sidewalk. from the rear pegs at about 30 mph he jumps up to the gas tank, feet first, stands straight up on the moving bike and puts his hands out to his sides in a jesus christ pose, flashing a silhouette in the sun. his heart pounds as he flies by crowds of astonished bystanders ... ... and crashes straight into a patio restaurant full of people. chev flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of overturned tables and busted dishes. a table spins like a coin at his feet. end: “everybody’s talking”}
