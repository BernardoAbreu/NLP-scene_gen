<L>__{interior reception room, oblonsky house day}
<A>__{anna, kitty, tanya and grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept. there is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it. they are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks. grisha is on anna's lap pulling at her hair. the spelling business, including misspellings by grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock rebuke. tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from anna's finger. kitty is not at all frightened of anna now; enraptured by her, laughing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle and look for another g for grigori }
<P>__{(she takes off her ring for tanya)}
<D>__{ here, darling, you can wear it till you go to bed }
<A>__{dolly sits apart, embroidering. she looks up at the sound of voices down stairs, oblonsky coming home. the children hear their father and abandon the card table, running out to greet him. dolly stands up to leave by a dif ferent door, giving anna a collusive glance. anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{well, that's the end of that.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{will you stay for the bobrishchev's ball, anna?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh . . . i always feel dull at a ball.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{how can you ever be dull?}
<A>__{oblonsky arrives in the doorway with tanya and grisha hanging on him.}
<C>__{kitty }
<D>__{stiva! tell anna she must come to the ball.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{of course she must.}
<A>__{he cocks an eye at anna: how did it go with dolly? anna moves her head: upstairs.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{. . . and god go with you.}
<A>__{kitty catches the moment.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{you can introduce me to your new governess.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{she's old! she's a hundred!}
<A>__{which leaves anna and kitty alone.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know why you want me to come. you want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<A>__{anna's smile is her acting out a mock mysteriousness.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know everything.}
<A>__{she has moved alphabet letters around to spell out vronsky. she laughs at kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for kitty.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown up . . . i was eighteen too, when i got married . . .}
<A>__{a quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before anna dispels it.}
