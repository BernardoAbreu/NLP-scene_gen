<L>__{exterior on deck circle day (b&w)}
<A>__{cobb swings the bat and shouts at the pitcher.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hey, greaseball, check your wife one of the players is missing!}
<A>__{the pitcher flips cobb the finger and takes a sign, deliv ering a pitch which is swung on and missed, strike three. cobb heads to the plate, passing his dejected teammate who has just struck out.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{who the hell ever signed you?}
<C>__{teammate}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{cobb laughs he seems to feed on these exchanges, and he stands in at the plate, addressing the umpire.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hey, cyclops, you're missing a good game.}
<C>__{umpire}
<D>__{shut up, cobb.}
<A>__{as cobb digs in, he reaches into his back pocket and drops something on home plate, in front of the catcher.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{here ya go...}
<A>__{the catcher holds up a pair of women's panties.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{your old lady left 'em in my car last night i thought you could give 'em back to her.}
<B>__{close on catcher}
<A>__{he flips his thumb, a sign for the pitcher to deck cobb.}
<C>__{catcher}
<D>__{you're going down, cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{the pitcher delivers a fastball right at cobb's head he hits the dirt just before the pitch arrives (and this is long before players wore protective headgear). cobb rises, laughing defiantly.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(to the pitcher)}
<D>__{that's as hard as you can throw?! shit, it that was my fastball i'd wear a dress!}
<A>__{then cobb shouts at the shortstop, a large german american athlete, the great honus wagner.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hey, wagner! i'd shade me a little up the middle if i was you!}
<A>__{wagner doesn't budge, comfortable in his position, not drawn into cobb's taunts. stoic, implacable far from cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(to catcher)}
<D>__{you try to take my head off then you throw a sinker away, in and out, same old shit sinker away...}
<B>__{close on cobb}
<A>__{his chatter stops, his focus is intense and sudden. he holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the ground. for all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in the way he holds the bat. a baton, a paintbrush, a magic wand...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{here comes the pitch sinker away and cobb unleashes a swing that is at once quick and powerful. he drives the ball to left, the opposite way wagner lunges to his right but the ball skips into left. cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and returning to first when the throw rifles into second. cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you god damn coward! you shoulda thrown at me again! you shoulda hit me in the fucking head!}
<A>__{cobb looks down at wagner who stands implacably at short stop, a large, powerfully built man.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hey, krauthead, i'm coming down.}
<B>__{close on wagner}
<A>__{he just nods.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{the pitcher stretches, looks and delivers and cobb breaks for second. the pitch is wide. the catcher fires. wagner takes the throw as cobb arrives in a spikes up slide. and wagner swipes a brutal tag in cobb's face his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across cobb's mouth. blood gushes. the ball pops free. wagner seems unbothered by the fact that cobb is safe at second he has bloodied cobb's face. cobb seems unboth ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess he has stolen second. both men seem satisfied.}
<B>__{back in dugout}
<A>__{more money is wagered.}
<B>__{pitcher}
<A>__{stretches and delivers cobb takes off for third. the throw is high he slides in safely.}
<B>__{in stands}
<A>__{bets are doubled. the stands are full of wagering. the whole ballpark is like a giant saloon drinking, smoking, wagering and the game is played by thugs and brigands.}
<B>__{cobb on third}
<A>__{yells at the pitcher and catcher.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you want in on the action? my mother has a better arm than you!}
<P>__{(to the catcher)}
<D>__{i'm coming to you, greaseball! coming to kick your dago ass!}
<B>__{catcher}
<A>__{steals a glance at cobb who takes a menacing lead off third. the catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.}
<B>__{pitcher}
<A>__{nods, winds up, and as he does here comes cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. and as the pitch arrives in the catcher's hands, the catcher digs in to take on cobb cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives. it is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm. a vicious collision between cobb and the catcher blood and dust. the ball rolls free. safe. cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. as the police rush out to break up the brawl...}
<C>__{cobb }
<D>__{in those days you didn't hold hands and dance with the men on the other teams. they were the enemy you fought with 'em.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i was the most hated man in baseball.}
