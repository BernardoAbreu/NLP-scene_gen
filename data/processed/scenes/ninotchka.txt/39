<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{it is evening. leon is walking nervously up and down. gaston is puttering over the drink table.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(consulting his watch)}
<D>__{what time have you, gaston?}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{eight forty two, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i guess it is eight forty two.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{you seem to be a bit nervous, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i am, gaston.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{if you will forgive me, ever since you met that bolshevik lady i've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(complacently)}
<D>__{have you?}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{decidedly. yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{and gaston, i was happier all day long. i felt i'd contributed something.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{well, sir, if you should do it again, which i hope you won't, please remember the order. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{may i add, sir, that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marx's capital on your night table. that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust, sir. i view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this bolshevik lady.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i can't follow you, gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? you being my servant? wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{isn't there any revolt in you? sometimes when i order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?}
<C>__{gaston}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{oh, you're a reactionary! don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "hey, you, d'algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?}
<C>__{gaston}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{emphatically not, sir. the prospect terrifies me. now, don't misunderstand me, sir, i don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that i should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.}
<A>__{the door bell rings. gaston starts for the door. with a gesture leon stops him.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{go to bed, little father, go to bed.}
<A>__{gaston leaves through the other door as leon exits toward the entrance hall. entrance hall leon's apartment leon enters the scene. he opens the door. outside stands ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely new outfit which she has bought, apparently to match the new hat. it takes leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor. he takes her hand and leads her in, closing the door. he looks at her again and kisses her hand.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i don't look too foolish?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{foolish? if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other, and when i caught up with it i would say, "just a moment, you charming little dress, i want you to meet ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." ninotchka feels more comfortable.}
<A>__{leon leads her into the living room. living room leon's apartment they both enter. ninotchka pauses a second and looks around.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you remember this room?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i've never been here before. i wonder whom you're thinking of. oh, i know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. today... now this might shock you... i went up to a taxi and said "eight rue du bois"... and here i am.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you see? life can be so simple.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{for twelve francs, seventy five.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{twelve seventy five from the clarence? the son of a gun made a detour!...}
<P>__{(charmingly)}
<D>__{but he got you here.}
<A>__{at this moment the clock starts to strike. they both look toward it. insert clock the hands register nine o'clock.}
<B>__{leon and ninotchka}
<A>__{leon wants to take her in his arms. she resists a little.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(reprimanding him)}
<D>__{it's nine o'clock.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{that's when one half of paris says to the other half, "what are your plans for this evening, madame?"}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(getting more and}
<D>__{more in the spirit of her change of}
<P>__{appearance)}
<D>__{well, first i should like to take off my hat and jacket.}
<P>__{(leon takes them)}
<D>__{then could we have some music?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{a wonderful idea! radio or records?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{not radio. let's have music that's just for ourselves.}
<A>__{leon turns on the victrola.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(with great feeling and sincerity)}
<D>__{i will play it softly because i have things to tell you about which i can't shout.}
<A>__{he walks back to ninotchka, who by now is seated in an armchair. he sits on the arm of the chair. he tries to make a declaration of his love. he stammers several words.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, my darling... i... we...}
<A>__{it is no use. in a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her in his arms and kisses her.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(as they come out of the kiss)}
<D>__{you see i couldn't shout that.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(with great feeling)}
<D>__{leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. now, leon that's wrong. i know they're not funny, they're silly. they're stupid. and still... i laugh... and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am i too talkative?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(radiantly)}
<D>__{no... go on.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it didn't exist... and, leon... i can't say it...}
<A>__{they kiss again. as the kiss ends they look at each other for a second. ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from it a little mirror and a lipstick. before she uses it she looks at leon with guilty happiness. leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what a gesture for a sergeant.}
<A>__{as soon as she is finished, ninotchka slips the mirror and lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances at the top of the desk.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{leon, i would like to ask you something.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{anything, ninotchka.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{if you don't want to answer, you needn't. but if you do, you must tell me the truth.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i promise... i swear.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{did you make any change in this room?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. i thought what a waste of silver. that's all that interested me then. now i would like to know... what happened to the woman?}
<A>__{leon too is completely serious by now. for answer he quietly opens the drawer of the desk. ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph. as she looks at it she rises.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{the duchess.}
<A>__{leon nods gravely.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(looking at the picture)}
<D>__{she is very attractive. she has great elegance.}
<P>__{(she looks back at leon)}
<D>__{she's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(after a little pause)}
<D>__{ninotchka, i love you.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i suppose she is very entertaining... it must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ninotchka, you're jealous.}
<A>__{ninotchka nods sadly.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(with great feeling)}
<D>__{leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... i couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... i couldn't breathe, i couldn't stand it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{my darling.}
<A>__{as he takes her in his arms, we}
