<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what will they be made of?}

<D>__{i think it's called silicon. charlie told me that.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{silicon is from sand.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{we were lying in the sand. it was my eighteenth birthday... we were so awkward... i would have married him anyway...}
<A>__{peggy starts to shift in the chair. her shorts hike up, her legs spread slightly. this is not lost on richard. weird, guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{in the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{no. the pill will change all that. then he wouldn't have blamed me. we were just too young.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{no. the pill will be for birth control. but girls do like sex. maybe not the first time.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{will you take of f your blouse?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{yes, every day.}
<P>__{(taking her blouse off getting spaced)}
<D>__{maybe i shouldn't have worn that dress? i told beth it was a bad idea. that's why they made me queen.}
<A>__{peggy's meandering makes richard nervous.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{richard, are you in there?}
<A>__{richard frantically tries to put peggy's blouse back on. she's limp and unresponsive.}

<D>__{one... two... three.}
<P>__{(claps twice)}
<D>__{you are now awake.}
<A>__{richard kneels on top of peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the buttons at her breasts. peggy comes to, as richard jumps off. she buttons her blouse, furious.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{richard! you should be ashamed of yourself.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{me? you went crazy! you started taking your clothes off. i was putting them back on for you.}
<C>__{peggy}
