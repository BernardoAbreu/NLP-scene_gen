<L>__{int day: connie's apt. (spring 1946)}
<A>__{connie and carlo's apartment. she's in a slip, on the phone. we hear the shower going in the bathroom.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{girl }
<P>__{(giggle)}
<D>__{i'm a friend of carlo's. i just wanted to tell him i can't see him tonight; i have to go out of town.}
<A>__{connie's face turns red.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{you lousy tramp bitch.}
<P>__{(click)}
<A>__{she slams the phone down; just as carlo is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{your girl friend. she says she can't make it tonight. you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. i will kill you, you bastard!}
<A>__{she hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip.}
<C>__{carlo}
<P>__{(defending himself)}
<D>__{you're crazy. she was kidding around; i don't know, some nut.}
<A>__{he pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{you're staying home. you're not going out.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{ok, ok. you gonna make me something to eat at least?}
<A>__{that calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties. carlo is dressed; puts on some cologne; connie appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{the food is on the table.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{i'm not hungry yet.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{eat it, it's on the table.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{ba fa goulle.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{ba fa goule you!}
<A>__{she turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. a moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. carlo slowly walks out, where we can see connie systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{you filthy guinea spoiled brat. clean it up or i will kick your head in.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{like hell i will.}
<A>__{she stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{clean it up!}
<A>__{he swings the belt against her heavy hips. she moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it ready.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{even the female corleones are murderers.}
<A>__{he puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. she makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. he pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. she gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face. she breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{the baby! the baby!}
