<L>__{interior bathroom early morning}
<A>__{leopold luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "whitecap" marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. he picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. it sprays. close up: leopold rings his bell. nothing happens. he discovers the clapper has been stolen.}
<L>__{interior kate's study afternoon}
<A>__{kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. she looks up and stops suddenly. leopold appears wearing many oddly assorted layers of charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, irish woolen cap, bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. he poses foppishly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight. see that the tub and basin are scrubbed up. remnants remain of this afternoons shave.}
<A>__{kate nods at him stupefied. due to the many layers of clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing skis.}
