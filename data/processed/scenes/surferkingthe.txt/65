<L>__{ext later that day in front of the canning company}
<A>__{once again three teams representing the three competing factions. large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession. the teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again, color coded. one from each team is stirring the team's chili while the others watch the judges anxiously. lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring to the judges. the judges are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili. they each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip. they smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost as if throwing up. a concessions kid is there with a tray of waters, which they quickly take advantage of. they move on to the grounds team. they get their portions and taste the chili and nod, not bad. they take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team. the portions are proudly scooped. they take a taste, smile and take some more. they huddle for a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot. the lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot.}
