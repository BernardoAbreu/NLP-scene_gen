<C>__{kale }
<D>__{ronnie, was that the whole code? ronnie?}

<P>__{(stepping closer)}
<D>__{great, kale. she lives.}
<A>__{kale and ronnie watch as ashley shakes hands with the club girl, then throws a quick surprised glance up to kale and ronnie. giles' body language tells us he's ready for ashley to leave. ashley gets the hint, shakes his hand, heads back down the driveway and out of sight. kale raises the binoculars again, then furiously grabs for his pad and pencil. binocular pov the club girl gets in her car. giles closes her door, watches as she backs out. kale tilts down to her license plate, starts jotting down the number.}

<C>__{kale}
<D>__{getting her license number }

<A>__{ashley and ronnie trade concerned looks.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{okay, i think we all just need to take a breath.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(heading out)}
