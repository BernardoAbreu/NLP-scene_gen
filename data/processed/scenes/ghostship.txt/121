<L>__{interior chimera "a" deck passage later day}
<A>__{epps steps from the room. she turns to close the door, but stops, holding there, strongly sensing something. the camera slowly comes around to her other side, revealing the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in the foggy light from a porthole, a man in dark clothing. epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. a beat as they hold there. the man only stares back at her, then turns to walk away.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute! hey!}
<A>__{moving with epps as she breaks into a run, going down the passageway. she comes to the corner, rounding it out onto another passageway. the man is nowhere to be seen. epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway. she turns back, running right into murphy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{take it easy, you'll live longer.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{did you see him?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{who?}

<D>__{the guy. he just came this way.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what guy?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there's somebody else on this boat.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what? what the hell're you talking about.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i saw him. just a minute ago. some guy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{of course i'm sure. i saw him.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you sure it wasn't me?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it wasn't you. it was somebody else. there's somebody else aboard.}
<A>__{a beat as murphy looks back at her.}
