<A>__{how?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i found a way to change the display language. i figured that out, and you didn't. why?}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{because i didn't. just like you and every other person on this planet, there are some things i know and some things i don't.}

<A>__{after a beat:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we had just left anaconda, everything seemed okay. we knew that a bunch of our cb radios had been stolen and that the iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels. pam was riding with jeff breer, the convoy commander. she wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the c.c. as we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street. dozens of them. it almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would. so they run on up in front of me, and i slam on my brakes. the rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going. next thing i know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an ied. i hear tommy wilkes on the radio saying, sandman's hit, sandman's hit. he's...he's everywhere.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{that's when the iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. i couldn't believe what was happening. it seemed like slow motion, like i was watching it on tv. people my friends were getting killed, and all i could do is watch. i didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. sort of snapped me out of my trance. but then, i guess i got hit in the head with a rock, `cause i blacked out.}

<D>__{do you happen to remem...mo... nea...}
<A>__{the cell phone service begins to cut out. suddenly, the coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the faint sound of an explosion. within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more proximate. the vibration becomes so intense that it violently shakes paul around the coffin. the sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above, flying by as the massive explosions continue. sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of the coffin as it shakes. paul does his best to brace himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful. a large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin, spanning almost its entire length. sand immediately pours through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto paul like an hourglass. fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the immense pressure from the sand above, paul positions himself underneath it and presses with all his might. he grunts and screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to keep the top from caving. the shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand continues. in efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any faster, paul removes the button down shirt from the hole and stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest volume. he removes the balled up cloth from the other hole and does the same with it. both offer very little help. the flashlight falls to the floor. the red light beam turns off. darkness. the sound of sand steadily pouring down.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{oh no...no...}
<A>__{paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting. white light shines, but then goes out. he shakes the flashlight and it stays on, shining its normal white beam. he assesses his situation, noticing that the coffin is already filled with a small layer of sand; a situation that is only going to get worse with time.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this can't be happening.}
<A>__{we see that dan brenner is no longer on the phone, and that the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through it no service available. once he feels it is secure enough, paul slowly moves his body away from the crack. although slightly caved, it does not show any more signs of possible collapse. sweat drenches his face. his eyes affixed, in utter disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling in around him inch by inch. he grabs the cell phone, only to see that he does not have a signal.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{no. come on. please work.}
<A>__{he shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin, hoping that it may somehow help. his efforts are futile. the flashlight goes dead. he hits it, shakes it. it turns back on. the brightness is diminished. still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of granules. then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. paul answers right away.}

<D>__{okay, paul. i'm with you. how about the media. i know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on?}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{that's good. it needs to stay that way. it's important that we keep this situation as contained as possible.}
<A>__{paul finds alan's obvious concern with doing damage control to be infuriating.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{about three inches to my right, there's a wall. three inches to my left, there's another wall. and about four inches above my head, there's a roof that's about to collapse and drown me in sand. i think this situation is pretty contained.}

<D>__{i'm going to switch on a recorder right now. just a second...}
<A>__{paul's visage expresses his confusion. a click is heard in the b.g. of alan's phone, followed by a low, steady hum. alan's speech becomes very laconic. his questions are clearly being read from a human resources handbook of some kind.}
<C>__{alan davenport }
<D>__{this is alan davenport, personnel director for crestin, roland and thomas, incorporated. the date is october 23, 2006. i am speaking with paul conroy. mister conroy, are you aware that i'm recording this conversation?}

<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{please answer the question.}

<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{thank you. now, mister conroy, when were you hired by crt?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{about nine months ago. around january of 2005. why are you wasting time with this?}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{i have your official date of hire as january 4th, 2005. is that correct?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who cares? this is fucking crazy }
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{january 4th, 2005. is that correct?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{and during your initial training, before being sent to iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you mean when i came down there to dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass?}
<A>__{the flashlight dims. paul angrily shakes it, returning it to full strength.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{you mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here? is that when i was made aware?}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{i need you to answer yes or no, please.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the flashlight begins to slowly dim.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{during that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with crt, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, i signed a bunch of things.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{yes or no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. i signed the contract. yes!}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{it's our understanding that you were taken hostage in iraq two hours ago, is that also correct?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. that's completely correct. what is the point of all this?}
<A>__{alan breaks from the h.r. handbook script, though his tone remains just as matter of fact. the flashlight continues its steady, slow dim.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company. as of this morning, your employment with crt was officially terminated.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait }
<A>__{the flashlight dims even more.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{it was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow crt employee pamela gorham.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. wait }
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly that any relationship, be it romantic or sexual in nature, deemed inappropriate by crt senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we...we were just friends.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{our records indicate differently.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is bullshit.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{we're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of crt at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination. therefore, in your case, that includes this incident or any consequences that may result from it.}
<A>__{paul sees where alan is going with this. he's thunderstruck.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about my insurance money? my family will need that money...}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{given that you were alive up until the time of your termination }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you son of a bitch. you can't do this.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{do you understand everything }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you can't do this!}
<A>__{alan takes a second before trying again.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{do you understand everything you've been told, mister conroy?}
<A>__{paul does not answer.}
<C>__{alan davenport }
<D>__{mister conroy?}
<A>__{after a long beat:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{that concludes our interview with paul conroy. i am now turning off the recorder.}
<A>__{a click is heard. the humming ceases.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you people can't just wash your hands of this. you bastards put me here.}
<C>__{alan davenport}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{alan ends the call. paul looks at the phone it is still holding a steady signal. battery life, however, is running quite low. all that remains is one blinking bar, indicating that paul has very little battery life left. he shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers it and looks at his watch. it's 8:31pm. the flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely. only the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{wasting little time, paul dials jabir. the phone rings and rings, but jabir does not answer. checking to make sure the he dialed the correct number, paul matches it against the phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin. seeing that he did, in fact, dial correctly, paul again tries to call jabir. while he waits through the many rings, he tries relighting the zippo. spark...spark...it catches. no one answers. paul's disquietude is evident in his increasingly erratic behavior.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{answer the phone!!}
<A>__{paul tries jabir once again, but still he does not answer the phone.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(desperate, exhausted)}
<D>__{why won't you answer?!!}
<A>__{it's then that something occurs to paul. he stares at the crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at an alarmingly fast rate. the crack has split jabir's written phone number in half. the aerial bombing. he wonders how it may have affected jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival. he places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his fingers. the flickering zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of oxygen. paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take. he then calls dan brenner. after a few rings, brenner answers. paul is surprisingly serene.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul, is that you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they're dead.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i just do.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{three f 16s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know. i felt it. did they know i was here?}
<A>__{the zippo flame flutters. weakens.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did they care?}
<A>__{dan does not answer.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{these people that took me if they're dead, they can't tell you where i am.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we can still try to track down your signal.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you tried that already.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we can try again.}
<A>__{paul appreciates dan's effort, but he knows there is little hope left for him.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{it's over, isn't it?}
<A>__{after a long beat:}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{paul doesn't say a word. he knows that dan is lying. after a beat, dan comes clean.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the flame of the zippo becomes smaller. it clearly has little life left.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what should i do?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's right just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i wish this could have gone differently.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah...me too.}
<A>__{after a long beat, paul ends the call. he forces a smile to his lachrymose face. utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video feature. he turns the phone to face himself, projecting his image on the display. he presses record.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{this is paul steven conroy. social security number 048 32 1198, date of birth 3 19 68. this video will serve as my last will and testament. to my wife, linda conroy, i leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever i have left in my annuity. to my son, shane conroy, i...i don't know. i don't have anything else. my stuff, like, my clothes. i wish i had more...i wish i had done more. your dad wasn't really much of anything, shane, i'm sorry. maybe if i was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, i would have more to leave you. but, you can be one of those people if you want. you can be whatever you want. just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom. and promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what. i love you very much, shane. maybe i never said that enough...maybe i did, i don't even know. that probably means i didn't.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, linda. i should have listened to you.}
<A>__{paul ends the video and closes the phone. he carefully places the phone into his pocket, where it may hopefully be found if he ever is. he lays back, staring at the almost completely extinguished zippo flame, as the sand continues to rain on him. down and down it pours, the sands of time passing might and main through the cracks. the zippo flame goes out. paul sits in the darkness, resigned to what apparently will be his fate. hold on black for several seconds...until suddenly, from inside paul's pocket, he hears a faint vibration. it's the cell phone. he looks at the number of who is calling him. shines the light of the cell phone on the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin. he can't believe what he's seeing. paul answers immediately.}

<D>__{they can't find them. they...can't. there's no way.}

<C>__{paul }
<D>__{oh my god. oh my god.}
<A>__{he places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading his fingers. he stares intently at his thumb. with the extremely sharp knife in hand, paul slowly lowers it just above his thumb. he inhales and exhales deep breaths, almost hyperventilating.}

<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired glow sticks. he shakes the sand off of it and places it across his mouth, biting into it hard. his heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken. after placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure that the camera picks up the image, he presses the record button on the cell phone. grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a primordial scream, paul closes his eyes and chops down with the knife. we see, through the display screen of the phone, paul sever his thumb with a swift chop of the blade. a small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams out in unfathomable pain. he falls to his side, still screaming and writhing. he reaches for his discarded outer shirt, which is still stuffed in the crack to help slow the influx of sand. removing the shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into the coffin more rapidly. paul wraps the shirt around his hand. the blood quickly soaks right through it. he is fading fast. his blood loss is great. shock sets in. he musters up the strength to send the video to jabir. to secure his shirt over the wound, paul removes his belt from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap. growing increasingly more pale, paul teeters on the verge of consciousness. everything becomes blurry to him. the phone falls from his hand. he shivers. his lips turn a light shade of purple and his face ash white. everything becomes more and more blurry. he fights with every last ounce of strength to remain conscious. while laying against the side of the coffin, the phone vibrates once again. to paul, the vibration against the wood seems so distant, so foreign. the vibration grows louder and louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of rotating helicopter blades. he then hears what sounds like voices, yelling from on top of the coffin.}
<D>__{voice #1 he's down here! voice #2 get him out! keep digging! voice #3 paul, we're here!}
<A>__{the cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in paul's head, each overlapping the other in distant echoes. shovels, digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the top of the coffin. the top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray of white light onto paul. he stares into the light, crying, eking out a tortured smile. suddenly, paul is back in the same predicament. the voices, the shovels, the light it was all a hallucination, brought upon by his loss of blood. he's still alone. he's still in the coffin, which continues to fill up with sand. he is too exhausted to display his disappointment. the phone continues to vibrate. it soon stops. paul is in too poor condition to show any concern. after a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. after several rings, paul languidly picks it up. he barely recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision. he's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words. he spits out stray particles of sand from his mouth.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul, it's brenner.}
<A>__{paul doesn't have the strength to answer.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{paul? are you there? paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm...here.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we're coming for you now. you hear me? we know where you are.}
<A>__{this news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for paul, who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did not have left in him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're coming?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we are, paul. we're almost there now.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{coalition forces picked up a shiite insurgent just outside of baghdad.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{said he knew where an american was buried alive. he agreed to show us where if we let him go.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're coming for me?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we're practically there already.}
<A>__{an impossible smile fights its way to paul's lips. his momentary joy is just that, however, for the sand has almost completely filled the coffin by this pointerior}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you have to hurry.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we are.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no...you have to hurry. the sand...it's filling up fast.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{just hang in there for three more minutes. this will all be over soon, i promise.}
<A>__{paul is very hopeful that dan is correct in his assumption.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay. i believe you. thank you. thank you.}
<A>__{a beep is heard. paul has another call coming in. he's visibly elated upon seeing who it is.}
<C>__{dan}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i have to go!}
<C>__{dan}

<D>__{call me right back.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{call me right back.}
<A>__{paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he has a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled with sand from top to bottom. he holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile, allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area remains.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{linda.}
<A>__{linda is in hysterics, which is evident in her speech.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{paul? paul is that you? tell me it's you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's me, sweetie.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh my god, paul! what are they doing to you? please tell me you're okay.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm...okay.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i just saw the news. what...oh my god, baby.}
<A>__{the flashlight dims. paul shakes it, regaining a bit of its strength.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's going to be okay now.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i missed all your calls. i left my cell phone at home. i just found out what was going on.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's okay. it's all okay. they're getting me out.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the people. americans. they found out where i am and they're on their way to get me.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(elated)}
<D>__{they are? oh thank god. oh dear god, thank you.}
<A>__{the flashlight flickers. paul hits it. it flickers some more.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's all going to be okay.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how do you know for sure? oh god, please tell me you're okay.}
<A>__{the flashlight continues to flicker almost like a stroboscopic light from this point forward.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i was so afraid i was going to lose you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're not.}
<A>__{linda breaks down in joyous tears.}

<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i should have never come here. you were right. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sweetie, i don't care. i just want you home. please come home to me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{swear it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will. i swear i will.}
<A>__{paul then receives a call on the other line. he checks to see who's calling. it's dan brenner.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{they're here!}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{the people?}
<C>__{paul}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i swear. i have to go.}
<A>__{paul clicks over to the other line, where dan brenner waits to speak with him. we hear dan yelling to people who are with him. a great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{move! move! let's go.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{brenner?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul? paul?}

<C>__{dan }
<D>__{corporal, get your men over here!}
<A>__{dan gets back on the phone with paul}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{he brought us right to you.}
<C>__{dan }
<P>__{(to the soldiers)}
<D>__{start digging! let's go, let's go!}
<A>__{the flashlight fades. paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full strength. meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top. it continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than ever. paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you have to hurry. it's almost full.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{just hang in there!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hurry! please!}

<P>__{(to the soldiers)}

<D>__{we're almost there, paul. we're almost there!}
<P>__{(to the soldiers)}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{faster!}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{we're almost there. we're right above you.}
<A>__{the level of sand grows even higher. paul spits away falling sand that threatens to suffocate him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't hear you! where are you?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we're almost there.}
<A>__{a soldier is heard off screen in the b.g. of dan's phone.}
<C>__{soldier }
<D>__{there it is!}

<P>__{(to the soldiers)}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hurry! please!!!}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we see the coffin! just hang in there!!}
<A>__{paul coughs out sand. he has a mere inch left above his head.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hurry! where are you? i don't hear you? please hurry!!!}
<A>__{the soldier is again heard off screen in the b.g. of dan's phone.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{it's clear!}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(to the soldier)}
<D>__{open it!}
<A>__{nondescript noise is heard through the phone, until it comes to an abrupt stop.}

<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what is it?!}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, paul.}

<D>__{it's mark white. he brought us to mark white. i'm }
<A>__{we see the circled name of "mark white" written in capital letters on the top of the coffin.}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no!! no!! no!!!}
<A>__{the battery life on paul's phone runs out, causing it to power down. the filament of the flashlight bulb burns out. as it does, the sand finally consumes the coffin, filling it completely. we hear paul's muffled screams emanate through the sand, until we no longer hear them at all.}
