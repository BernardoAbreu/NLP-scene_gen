<A>__{close on the pet of the month as she smirks coyly from the centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position representing mad desire. sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the photo.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{oh, darlin'...come sit on my face...}
<A>__{he stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and screams! the sea spider is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead. sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming. he hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams in more pain. the whole dorm looks up amazed, cobb takes off his sunglasses, even jones and dejesus temporarily "sober up" to stare.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{that bitch!}
<B>__{mess}
<A>__{sixpack storms into the mess with the dead sea spider. he points angrily at his bleeding foot. jones and dejesus move up to watch.}

<P>__{(imitating sixpack)}
<D>__{sorry, darling...just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...}
<A>__{everyone laughs, but sixpack. he has revenge in his eyes. he holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward willie.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{you think you're so funny? wait till you taste this!}
<A>__{as he pushes the dead creature into her face beck's voice behind him makes him freeze.}
<C>__{beck's voice}
<D>__{that's enough!}
<A>__{everybody turns to see beck standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{look at my foot, sir! this bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(cold as ice)}
<D>__{how do you know it was williams?}

<A>__{close on blackboard mess morning screech! chalk on the blackboard as bowman writes "2" in place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words "days till pickup." jones, sitting next to cobb, looks up from his tray of cereal and holds his head in mock misery.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{oooooh. damn! not so loud. turn down the music.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what music? there ain't no music.}
<A>__{dejesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side of cobb.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{oooooh.}

<D>__{you know it's really crazy to pretend to be drunk, but it's fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover.}

<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{pretty good. he sent them out videotaping outcrop.}
<A>__{underwater same close on a whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the end of willie's mechanical suit arm. like a drill its diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core sample. it's a sinister hand attachment, something captain hook would have loved. above her the rov maneuvers into position for a better view. inside the shack control same beck is in the control station, staring at the video monitors the image from the rov. willie removes a slender instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump motion, chunk, chunk...activates an explosive charge. she puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{charge set?}
<C>__{willie's voice}
