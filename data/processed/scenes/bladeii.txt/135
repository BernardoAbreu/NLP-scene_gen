<A>__{carter stevens shuts down his computer workstation, then moves to the heavy oak door, glancing at a medical chart as he opens it. when he looks up }
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{you?}
<A>__{a fist punches stevens in the face.}
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{stands in the entry way. whistler is behind him, holding a gun to nyssa. scud is there, too.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(mobing in on stevens)}
<D>__{start talking, bitch.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{i don't know what you }
<A>__{blade spins stevens around, shoving his face against a glass case, crushing the man's nose, spiderwebbing the glass.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{nomak! you created him!}
<A>__{blade clamps his fingers around stevens' broken nose and twists it with a sickening crunch. stevens screams, caving.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{ohgodohgodohgod...}
<P>__{(in agony)}
<D>__{alright, alright. yes, we did...}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{please! please!!!}
<A>__{blade releases him. stevens sinks to the floor, cradling his brutalized face.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{keep talking, stevens. tell me why.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{the shadow cabinet. for decades they've been trying to find a way to rid themselves of their hereditary weaknesses. viral epidemiology, immunochemistry. recombinant dna was the next logical step.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<P>__{(genuinely horrified)}
<D>__{no, that's not possible. they wouldn't keep something like this from me...}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{your father didn't want you to know.}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{something went wrong. the reaper strain was too aggressive. then nomak escaped.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{and we're supposed to clean up your mess. fucking perfect.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{look, the fact that nomak was artificially created didn't make the threat any less urgent. he was still out there, spreading the reaper virus.}
<A>__{but blade's not concerned about that now. he's got something more pressing on his mind.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{the genetic material you spliced into nomak }
<P>__{(beat; almost fearful)}
<D>__{where did you get it?}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<D>__{i should think that would be obvious at this pointerior}
<B>__{angle on damaskinos}
<A>__{standing behind them.}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<D>__{we took the genetic material from you.}
