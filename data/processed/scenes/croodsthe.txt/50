<A>__{his face slathered with reddish mud.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{painting is a thing of the past. i call this, a "snap shot."}
<A>__{grug takes a huge flat stone and smashes it against thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock. grug shows the croods.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{let's do it again. i think i blinked.}
<A>__{thunk passes out.}

<D>__{i call them "shades."}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{the sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore! where do you get these great ideas?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{since i don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach. down deep below, and then up again into my mind.}

<A>__{grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. grug is launched into the sky. grug becomes a speck in the sky. he is hit by lightning.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{i almost feel sorry for him.}
