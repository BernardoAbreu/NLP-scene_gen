<A>__{alice walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a towel turban. she flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for her hairbrush. she takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down. she hums. opens her top drawer. nothing there. opens the next drawer. nothing there. opens the next drawer. nothing there. alice opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes! it flails at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier as having a navajo bracelet on it. the snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as alice tries to shake it free. the snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack. there is no way that alice can get past the snake to run away. her scream is loud.}
