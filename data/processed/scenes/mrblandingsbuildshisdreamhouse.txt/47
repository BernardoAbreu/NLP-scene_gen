<A>__{jim's cost chart insert jim's cost chart rising diagonally and bisecting the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at $5000 and running up to around $17,000. resting on the line at exactly $10,000 is a miniature of the old house. fluttering across the scene from left to right is a letter from smith on the stationery of the lansdale realty co. as we see the letter and hear the voice of smith, miniature figures of smith and hackett appear at the lower side of the house. their shoulders start pushing the house up the graduated scale. over this:}

<D>__{"dear mr. blandings: while your offer of ten thousand two hundred is still not acceptable to ephemus hackett "}
<A>__{a letter on danton & bascomb's stationery flutters across the screen from right to left. a miniature figure of jim appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. over this, we hear:}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{"dear mr. smith: you may inform mr. hackett that the very highest i could possibly go "}
<A>__{as a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first from left to right and then from right to left, and the house is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the following lines:}
<C>__{smith's voice}
<D>__{"dear friend blandings "}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{"my dear friend smith "}
<C>__{smith's voice}
<D>__{"dear blandings !"}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{"dear smith !"}
<A>__{throughout this smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed while jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall. the special effect concludes with the house finally and firmly at rest on the preordained $11,550. as the antagonists on both sides of the house relax, smith reaches around in front of the house and shakes hands with jim. it's a deal! about halfway through when the going gets tough, jim beckons muriel to help in the losing fight. as they now embrace, smith and hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.}
