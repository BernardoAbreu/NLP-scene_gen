<L>__{interior catch's apartment later that day}
<A>__{we've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this, all blinds open. we start in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. some brightly painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer. in the living room there are two chairs now, and more lamps and tables. our pan reveals that the dog from the alley is sitting in the living room, watching catch whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall a mountain scene. he holds the picture in one place, then moves it to another, wondering. his fight with sharon still colors his mood, but he's working through it.}
