<L>__{interior styles' office night}
<A>__{styles, finishing his paperwork. he rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in darkness. he's about to leave when he notices a silhouette in the doorway.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{"you have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs". that was good.}
<A>__{styles squints at the figure.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{tom, is that you?}
<A>__{hardy steps forward, into the office.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{it was so good, i actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. the base commander. the one in control.}
<A>__{you couldn't let him testify, could you?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{if you let him testify then it would have all come out. west was supposed to take care of it out there, shut nunez up and then disappear. but it got messy and people got killed. so you called your old pal tom hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you're drunk }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm not going to cover for you, bill. not for this.}
<A>__{styles, realizing what hardy's talking about.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{look }
<A>__{he begins to move from behind his desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{stay where you are.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{or what? you've gone round the bend }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{west had a partner. someone who knew how to get things done.}
<A>__{hardy throws the papers onto styles' desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what i can't understand is why you signed these. if you'd just let west take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{that's preposterous }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{toxicology report came back. kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. it's for asthmatics. if an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. i checked with the nurses at the hospital you're the only other person who visited kendall.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{wanted to see if he was okay }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you poisoned him, bill. you heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like pike.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{i'm not even going to dignify that }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no! you will stand there and you will listen! what happened to you, bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world. you were the one who believed in it }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? the army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? there's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{he walks towards the desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no more witnesses. west's a ghost. but it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and kendall's toxicology report. and that'll be enough.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you're crazy }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you can't duck this, bill. i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{for the last time, i have no idea what you're talking about }
<C>__{hardy}
<P>__{(squinting)}
<D>__{get your hands away from the desk!}
<A>__{in the darkness we see styles move suddenly...}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{osborne, gun!}
<A>__{hardy dives to the floor osborne in the doorway, pistol raised, fires two shots! muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as styles is blown back against the wall! hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the light. styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. dead. osborne lowers her weapon, shaking. hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. inside it sits an ivory handled pistol. fully loaded, safety off. it's presence tells them everything they need to know.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it's west's, isn't it?}
<A>__{hardy nods and then turns to look down at styles' body.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{now it's over.}
