<L>__{exterior side of house}
<A>__{brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks around. laura comes out the front door, cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. brendan begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops him a match being struck. brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole. brendan's pov through the fence a brightly lit window in the side of brad's house, and through the window the party. a dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all inky black. the figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party, absently stroking his cheek. brendan steps back snap! a twig. the figure freezes. then, making no noise at all, it spins to face brendan, a towering black form against the window. the glowing cigarette falls to the grass. a metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun. brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. a beat. through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away. brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.}
