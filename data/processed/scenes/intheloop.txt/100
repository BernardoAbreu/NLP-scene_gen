<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{simon}

<C>__{judy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{though maybe? what's brave about doing the `right thing'? nothing. doing the wrong thing is braver. in a way. i mean, you know, wars sometimes work. the war of independence, that worked. for the americans. second world war. that was a good idea. i mean not a good idea but ...}
<C>__{simon}
