<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you own it?}
<C>__{zoe}

<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{if you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours.}

<A>__{nana hands zoe a cup of tea. zoe's eyes well with tears.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what am i going to do?}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{i'm confused. isn't this what you wanted? you bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor. this isn't what we would call an accident.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{but now it's all happening so fast. did i really think this through?}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{we talked about it for months. you said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{but this guy, he's...special. it's all going to fall apart now.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{what makes him so special?}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{i don't know. he's very...real. and funny. and different. the other guys i've been with all had their briefcases and their five year plans and their secretaries they were fucking. stan doesn't have a five year plan. i don't even know if he has a plan.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{what about a secretary?}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{some kid named fred.}
<P>__{(then)}
<A>__{i like him, nana.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{well, if he's the right one, he'll stay.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{gosh, i don't know. i hoped that would be enough to appease you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{should i still visit him for the weekend? or should i just vanish and hope he forgets i ever existed.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{don't be silly. go up there for the weekend. spend some time with him and see what he's really like.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{yeah. you're right.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{you might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot.}
<A>__{zoe looks at nana. douchebag?}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{zoe is in the car. we are close on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. could happen, right?}
<A>__{widen to reveal nuts in the passenger seat. he's yawning.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{i'm sorry. am i keeping you up?}
<A>__{nuts closes his eyes and lays down.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{my whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug eyes open?}
<P>__{(yawning)}
<D>__{thanks. now i'm yawning. but why am i so tired? i slept nine hours.}
<P>__{(thinks, then)}
<D>__{and i'm starving, too. what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.}
<L>__{interior gas station mini mart day}
<A>__{zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. one of those gas station big gulp cups. even the trucker next to her chooses a smaller cup. then, a look crosses her face.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{am i even allowed to drink coffee?}
<A>__{the trucker looks at her. she looks at him.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{do you know anything about being pregnant?}
<L>__{exterior car later}
<A>__{zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere.}
<L>__{interior car same}
<A>__{zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. a small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of cheetos is in her lap. her cell phone rings. zoe doesn't move. after the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around. it takes her a few moments to realize what's happened. she looks at the little coffee cup.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{thanks a lot, decaf.}
<A>__{she picks up the phone.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{where are you?}
<A>__{zoe looks around.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<L>__{exterior little goat farm day}
<A>__{zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic hudson river farm. there are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep. the house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather vane on top. zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face. zoe sighs.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he's so not a douchebag.}
<L>__{interior house moments later}
<A>__{they enter the front door. zoe takes in the charming carriage house.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i can't believe you live here. this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i just come on weekends. my parents really live here.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{oh. where are they now?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{in the kitchen.}
<A>__{zoe stops short.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{wait, they're here? now? is this a "meet the parents" kind of thing? i wasn't prepared for this.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{no. not at all. i mean, you'll meet them, but }
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{when you said come up for the weekend, i assumed it was just us.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i think i need to lay down.}
<L>__{interior stan's bedrom moments later}
<A>__{zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin. stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{are you hung over or something?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm just...not myself. give me ten minutes. a ten minute power nap and i'm good. i need to regroup.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{are you sure you're okay?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{zoe? hello?}
<A>__{but she's already out. stan gives her a little poke.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{stan enters the kitchen. his parents, joan and edward look up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter in law.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh. it's just you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{she's taking a nap.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{a nap? now? she just got here.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{mom, i need you to not be judgemental, okay. i like this girl a lot.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{how can i be judgemental? we haven't even met her yet.}
<A>__{we hear a squeak, squeak, squeak coming down the hall.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{what the heck is that?}
<A>__{the squeaking continues and then all eyes turn as nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops. he tilts his head.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{oh. this is nuts.}
<A>__{joan and edward take in the raggedy wheelchair bound dog and then look at stan. stan shoots his mom a look.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{who's judging?!}
<L>__{interior stan's bedroom later}
<A>__{it's now dark. zoe is asleep in the exact same position. suddenly, we hear a loud grumble. her eyes open.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{we hear the grumble again. it's her stomach. she puts her hands over it.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{whoa.}
<A>__{zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the cheetos. the bag is empty. she smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.}
<L>__{interior hallway moments later}
<A>__{zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{stan?}
<A>__{no one in sight. she waits a beat and then whispers louder.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{stan!}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen. nuts is with her.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan? hello?}
<A>__{zoe stands there unsure of what to do nexterior then we hear her stomach growl again. her eyes turn to the stove. something smells out of this world. she tiptoes over and opens the pot. it's beef stew.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{she makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon. she can't find one. she spies a loaf of white bread. grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it.}
<C>__{zoe }
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{she replaces the lid on the pot. and now she just stands there. and stands there some more.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh, who am i kidding?}
<A>__{she quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. this time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. she takes a huge bite.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<A>__{stew dribbles down her chin. she takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one. nuts starts to whine and beg. zoe uses her bread ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. it lands with plop. and now joan enters. zoe and nuts turn, their mouths bursting. joan doesn't quite know what to do. all she knows is she's supposed to be open minded.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{would you like a plate?}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head no. wow. this is embarrassing.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{a napkin?}
<A>__{zoe nods her head. joan gives her one. zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{i'm joan.}
<A>__{zoe nods. still can't swallow the bite.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{and you must be zoe.}
<A>__{zoe nods again. she tries to shake joan's hand. it's the best she can do. unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the cheetos powder. joan pulls her hand back.}
<L>__{interior dining room later}
<A>__{the dining room is warm and lovely. there's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. despite the inviting room, zoe looks very uncomfortable.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the stew is delicious, honey.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, mom, it's awesome.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(to zoe)}
<D>__{have you ever in your life had stew like this? come on, be honest.}
<A>__{zoe looks at joan. joan smiles. it will be their secret.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{uh...no. never.}
<L>__{interior living room later}
<A>__{they are having coffee and dessert in the living room. things seem more comfortable now. zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself. nuts sits beside her.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{oh, you can say paralyzed. he doesn't mind.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{no, our pets are all in great shape. purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{those puppy mills are terrible. i read about them in the paper.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, that's actually how i ended up with nuts. i bought him from this pet store near my house. six months later, i had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you should have sued that place.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i thought about it, but what was that really going to do? they were still going to sell inbred dogs. so...i took the money i made when i left google and just bought the place figuring i would do better.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you worked for google?}
<A>__{zoe nods.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{how could i not know that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you never asked.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{and you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store?}
<A>__{stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i love that.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's been fun. beats brand management, that's for sure.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(to edward)}
<D>__{that sounds like us, honey.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's true.}
<P>__{(to zoe)}
<D>__{when we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. and now, twenty years later, here we are...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. make things happen your own way, you know?}
<A>__{zoe forces a smile. if only they knew.}
<L>__{exterior little goat farm night}
<A>__{the moon is full and fireflies dot the air as zoe and stan walk the grounds of the farm. nuts trots rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. this one is more rugged, with mountain bike type wheels.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i can't believe that nuts has an off road wheelchair.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he's got one for snow, too. with little skis on the bottom.}
<A>__{stan smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're really something.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{are you making fun of me? do you think i spoil him?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{no, i really think you're amazing. i mean, that story you told tonight. you just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog? started your own business, just like that?}
<A>__{zoe shrugs.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{you're very...unique.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, you're a dime a dozen. i can't tell you how many banjo playing, cheese makers i've been with.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. like, how can you be so perfect? why are you even still single? i can't believe no one's snatched you up by now.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i drive them all away, i guess.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{stan takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{look, i know this is all going fast...the time we're spending together, meeting my parents and everything...but, i'm okay with that. i want it to go fast.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it is going fast.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{but isn't that okay? aren't we old enough to skip all the bullshit? what are we waiting for? i...want to be with you.}
<A>__{zoe opens her mouth. she's got to tell him. before this goes any further, she has to tell him.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{come on. there's something i want to show you.}
<L>__{interior cheese cave night}
<A>__{it's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese. stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's cheese.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's a new kind of goat's milk we're using. i've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age. it'll be ready for market in several months.}
<P>__{(then, excited)}
<D>__{want to know what it's called?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{zoe.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you named a piece of cheese after me?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{not just one piece. the whole line. this will forever in history be known as the zoe.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it.}
<P>__{(with a wink)}
<D>__{but that'll never happen.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{because it's going to be fantastic. sweet and sassy and very complex. why do you think i'm calling it zoe?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before.}
<A>__{zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're kind of hard to read right now. you're either seriously flattered or totally repulsed.}
<A>__{zoe smiles.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i want to kiss you right now, but it really smells like cheese in here.}
<L>__{exterior dairy moments later}
<A>__{the door to the dairy kicks open and stan carries zoe out. her legs are around his waist and they are making out like crazy.}
<L>__{interior house moments later}
<A>__{stan carries zoe up the stairs. they are tripping and kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.}
<L>__{interior stan's bedroom night}
<A>__{stan throws zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. his body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{you're such a douchebag.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior stan's room later}
<A>__{they are now on their backs staring at the ceiling. they look happy and worn out their p.o.v. those little glow in the dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. there's barely any glow left. stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{that was amazing. i mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over the top, amazing.}
<A>__{zoe turns to him. takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{there's something i really have to tell you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{there's something i have to tell you, too.}
<A>__{now stan turns to her. they are face to face.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{can i go first? `cause if we're going to say the same thing, i want to say it first.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{we're not going to say the same thing.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and i just have to say it.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i've dated a lot of women. i mean, not tons, but a lot. and, the thing is, i've never...been in love before. i've never even told anyone i love them before. because i just never felt it. but from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, i feel this, this...}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{maybe this is too much to say right now, but...i love you, zoe. i really do.}
<A>__{stan finishes. he looks at her and smiles. zoe just stares at him.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{in my mind, you were supposed to say, i love you, too.}
<A>__{instead, zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom. a beat later, we hear her vomit.}
<L>__{interior stan's bathroom moments later}
<A>__{zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth. stan enters.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{zoe?}
<A>__{he looks at her. sees the tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{why are you crying? everything's perfect.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's not.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{sure it is.}
<A>__{zoe takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{uh, i'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast.}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i just found out.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{pregnant? as in you're going to have a baby?}
<A>__{zoe nods.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know. it's hard to explain.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, who's it?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't know who the father is. i kind of know him. i just don't know his name exactly. it was sort of anonymous.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{anonymous?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he's a donor. from a sperm bank.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? sperm bank? what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know, this is so fucked up.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{when did all of this happen?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{the day we met. that same day. and i didn't tell you because i didn't think there was any way i could be pregnant.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{but...why?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{no, why would you do this?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because i wanted a baby. and i'm almost forty, and i never met the right guy. i was afraid if i waited any longer it would all pass me by, and i'd miss my chance.}
<A>__{stan just looks at her. speechless.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{i didn't know you. i would have never done it if }
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i just told you i loved you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well....do you not now?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're pregnant.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{don't say it like that.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're pregnant.}

<D>__{yes. i'm pregnant. i'm pregnant!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i tell you i'm in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some stranger's child?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{don't say it like that. you make it sound dirty.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i...i'm stunned. i don't know what to say. what the fuck am i supposed to say?! this is great fucking news? congratulations?! why did you wait so long to tell me?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because i'm freaking out, okay! i didn't know what to do. i made this big decision to do this and then i met you }
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, what am i supposed to do now? this isn't how it was supposed to be. this isn't what }
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry, okay? life isn't perfect. it's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band. it's messy. it's fucked up. this is real life, okay? i'm sorry to break it to you.}
<A>__{they both stand there. after the raised voices, the silence feels more pronounced.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{sorry? what's sorry going to do?}
<A>__{stan walks out. zoe stands there. and stands there. and then she starts to cry.}

<C>__{stan}
<A>__{i also don't know what you really like to eat and what's just a craving, or when you start laughing hysterically and then crying and you say, this isn't me, if that's true because i don't really know the real you. all i know is the pregnant you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{that is weird.}
<C>__{stan}

<D>__{my college boyfriend took it. so, i guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close. it's held up.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's a nice ass.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you said you don't know the real me, so i thought i'd show you.}

<D>__{you look like anthony michael hall.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{this period, as horrible as it was, made me who i am. i think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. it builds character.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it also taught me that i should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again.}

<C>__{stan}
<D>__{fifth place.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{but i still look super happy, right? that's all because of nana. whatever i did, she thought it was the best.}

<D>__{why are you dressed like that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{halloween. we were supposed to be a traffic light but mona bagged out at the last minute and so bobby and i just look like idiots. that's typical mona, by the way.}

<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you look just like her.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{this is the last picture of her that i have. she lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. i was eight when she died.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i...can't imagine.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{she had a great laugh. and really soft hands. she used to rub my back before i went to sleep.}

<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{not for me they can't.}
<A>__{stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. finally, the silence is broken by the telephone ringing.}
