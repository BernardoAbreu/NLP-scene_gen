<A>__{dr. gries, dr. becker, damon and nurse harding enter the room.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you left him in all night?}
<C>__{nurse harding}
<D>__{shit, he's probably dead. dr. gries [defensively] i tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday...}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{don't get all worked up, justin. i expected some common sense on your part and clearly i was expecting too much. [beat] just open the drawer.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{we never should have done this to him...}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{well, what are we gonna do about it now?}
<A>__{nothing is gries' answer. still, becker seems to share the concern. becker motions for them to open the drawer. they pull him out. starks looks cold and wrecked.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{is he? [impatiently] is he dead?}
<A>__{becker feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{no. [to harding and damon] get him upstairs.}
