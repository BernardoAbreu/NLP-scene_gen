<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. mr. handsome, animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{holy shit. your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{my brother is discreet.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(rubbing her hand over her jaw)}
<D>__{won't he be able to tell?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{my brother says the guy's a thirty five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{god, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah, well my brother is his shrink.}
