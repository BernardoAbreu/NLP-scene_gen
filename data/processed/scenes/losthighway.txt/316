<L>__{interior andy's house night}
<A>__{pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room. pete stops short and stares. a movie projector is running in the living room. a porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end. alice is in the porno film. a man is fucking her from behind with loud slapping sounds of flesh banging flesh. her face is in the foreground. her eyes look out directly at pete. she is loving every minute of it. inside pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. he looks around. he sees clothes scattered about. he picks up a girl's sweater and smells it. he looks up the stairs. feet appear at the top of the stairs. they start down. pete runs for the bar. along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well stacked woman off a rectangular glass topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar. he can hear andy approaching. he can hear andy gather two glasses. he can hear alice being fucked harder in the porno film. he clenches his teeth with rage. suddenly, andy moves right in front of him. they see each other. andy's eyes widen pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of andy's head. andy falls. the breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead. pete turns. alice is coming quickly down the stairway naked, except for a pair of panties. lipstick is smeared around her mouth. she is carrying a half filled pillowcase. her porno film is playing on the wall behind her. these images jump and spin in pete's mind. he moves unsteadily toward her.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you got him.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(still holding the figurine)}
<D>__{alice, i...}
<A>__{pete starts to tremble. he drops the figurine. he tries to embrace her. there is a crashing noise behind him. pete turns and sees andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, then charging full speed at pete. andy hits him hard, and pete goes down. when pete hits the ground, he pushes andy up and throws out his arms. this, and andy's momentum, catapult andy into the corner of the rectangular glass topped coffee table. there is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into andy's forehead. close up of andy's head impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(amazement no feeling)}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{pete pulls himself off the floor. pete moves close to alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at andy's dead body. while pete stares, unbelieving, at andy alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on. on the sofa next to it lay andy's trousers. she goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band. alice hands the roll to pete.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{put this in your pocket.}
<A>__{alice kneels next to andy's body and quickly removes his rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck. these items she puts inside the empty pillowcase. alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on. pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything. she comes back to pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{you all right? pete, we killed him.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you killed him.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{alice?}
<A>__{alice slides up close to pete.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it was an accident... accidents happen every day.}
<A>__{pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding on for dear life.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{alice...}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(pushing back)}
<D>__{we gotta get the stuff and get out of here.}
<A>__{alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase. pete opens his eyes, he sees alice move as a blur. he looks around the room, which spins in and out of focus. his eyes land on, a photograph in a frame on the wall. this photo troubles him. pete squints, then points to the photograph.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{is that you? are both of them you?}
<A>__{close up of the photograph four people appear in the frame: andy, renee, alice and mr. eddy. alice stops and comes back. she looks at the photo, walks closer to it, and points at herself.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{that's me.}
<A>__{she turns to pete. pete is staring at the photograph at alice and renee in the photograph. his nose is bleeding profusely.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{pete?...}
<A>__{pete starts to reel blood from his nose soaking his shirt.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{where's the bathroom?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{up the stairs down the hall.}
<A>__{pete runs up the stairs about to get sicker. alice watches him go with a nuance of disdain.}
