<L>__{interior soda shop. day.}
<A>__{mr. johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin dispensers. he whistles brubeck's "take five" when the screen door slams behind him. mr. johnson looks up with a start.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{oh, hi.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{aren't you a little early?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i brought you something ... from the library.}
<B>__{closer. following david.}
<A>__{he has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three feet long. mr. johnson looks at him a little intrigued as david crosses to the counter.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's an art book.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{oh my gosh, bud ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{mr. johnson reaches out and opens the cover. after a beat, his eyes widen.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i just thought since you liked painting it might help to ...}
<A>__{mr. johnson gasps. it's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a gasp. david looks over at him but he's lost in the pages. his pov. (insert) art book ... massacio's "expulsion of adam and eve' leaps off the pages in vibrant, tortured color. the beauty of the garden is offset by their agony and their shame. he turns the page ... titian's "venus to utano". soft, fleshy, in a rich golden light. she is utterly real and entirely nude. the folds of her flesh almost seem to glow ... rembrandt's "self portrait." dark reds, umbers, blacks and browns. he looks back at mr. johnson with pain and wisdom. there's a brilliant light on his hair.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{mmmmgh ...}
<A>__{faintly, almost imperceptibly, the sound of a rich aria begins to underscore the images. it's so faint you can't be sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with your eyes. he turns the pages faster. breugal's "harvesters" ... tumees "steam train" ... monet's "cathedralo" ... cezanne's "oranges" ... mr. johnson shuts the book.}
<B>__{wider. soda shop.}
<A>__{they sit like that for a beat.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{it's beautiful, bud ...}
<A>__{he looks up at david, troubled.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{i will never be able to do that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, well you're just starting out. i mean, you can't do it ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{no, that's not it.}
<A>__{mr. johnson shuts the book gently.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{where am i going to see colors like that?}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{what can he say. david looks over at mr. johnson who just smiles and shrugs.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{must be awfully lucky to see colors like that. i bet they don't even know how lucky they are.}
<B>__{close up. david.}
<A>__{he just stares for a second.}
