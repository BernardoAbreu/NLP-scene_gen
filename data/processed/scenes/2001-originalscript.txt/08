<L>__{exterior cave new sound}
<A>__{dozing fitfully and weakened by his struggle, moonwatcher is startled by a sound. he sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul. never in his life – already twice as long as most members of his species could expect – has he heard a sound like this. the great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder. it seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at concealment, and ignoring all obstacles. and then there came a sound which moonwatcher could not possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet.}
