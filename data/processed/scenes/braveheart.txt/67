<L>__{exterior stirling field day}
<A>__{stirling castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge. scottish nobles have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and banners, and are attended by squires and grooms. the mists of morning shroud most of the field. but from the opposite side of the bridge they hear the clattering of a huge army moving forward. lochlan, a noble, gallops to mornay.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{it sounds like twenty thousand!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{the scouts say it is ten.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{and we have but two!}
<B>__{the common scottish soldiers}
<A>__{are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and daggers. as through the mists they see the numbers arrayed against them, a young soldier tugs at a grizzled veteran.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{so many!}
<C>__{scottish veteran}
<D>__{the nobles will negotiate. if they deal, they send us home. if not, we charge. when we are all dead and they can call themselves brave, they withdraw.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{i didn't come to fight so they could own more lands that i could work for them!}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{nor did i. not against these odds!}
<A>__{he lowers his pike and starts to desert. at first one by one and then in clumps, more highlanders follow. the nobles see the desertion.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{stop! men! do not flee! not now! wait until we have negotiated!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{they won't stop and who could blame them?}
<A>__{then, riding into the mob of men, comes wallace, followed by his friends. he's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it. the entire scottish army watches in fascination as wallace and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. the soldiers whisper among themselves...}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{william wallace?}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{couldn't be.}
<A>__{the common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up the hill to see the confrontation. as wallace and his captains reach the nobles, stephen laughs.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the almighty says this must be a fashionable fight, it's drawn the finest people.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{where is thy salute?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{for presenting yourselves on this battlefield, i give you thanks.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{this is our army. to join it, you give homage.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i give homage to scotland. and if this is your army, why does it go?}
<A>__{wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen men, now frightened, ready to desert. we play this picture, wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing that has grown beyond anyone's imagination. he glances at his friends: campbell, hamish, stephen. they've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.}
<C>__{scottish veteran}
<D>__{we didn't come to fight for them!}
<C>__{shouts from mob}
<D>__{home! the english are too many!}
<A>__{wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{sons of scotland!... i am william wallace!}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{william wallace is seven feet tall!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{yes, i have heard! he kills men by the hundreds! and if he were here, he would consume the english with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his ass!}
<A>__{many laugh all get the pointerior}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i am william wallace. and my enemies do not go away. i saw our good nobles hanged. my wife... i am william wallace. and i see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. you have come to fight as free men. and free men you are! what will you do with freedom? will you fight?}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{two thousand, against ten? we will run and live!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{yes. fight and you may die. run and you will live, at least awhile. and dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom?}
<A>__{down on the plain, english emissaries in all their regal finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce.}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{look! the english comes to barter with our nobles for castles and titles. and our nobles will not be in the front of the battle!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{no! they will not!}
<A>__{he dismounts, and draws his sword.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{and i will.}
<A>__{slowly, the chant begins, and builds...}
<C>__{scots}
<D>__{wal lace! wal lace! wal lace!}
<A>__{bagpipers play, pulling the mob back into companies. but through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy army. hamish, campbell and stephen move up beside william.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{fine speech. now what do we do?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.}
<A>__{campbell, hamish and stephen ride off. mornay reins his horse over, lifts the reins of wallace's horse, and extends them to him: an invitation to join the pre battle talks. wallace mounts up and rides out with the scottish nobles to meet the english contingent. out on the field, the two groups of riders meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. cheltham, head of the english contingent, glares at wallace.}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{mornay. lochlan. inverness.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{cheltham. this is william wallace}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{here are the king's terms. lead this army off the field, and he will give you each estates in yorkshire, including hereditary title, from which you will pay him an annual }
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i have an offer for you.}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{...from which you will pay the king an annual duty...}
<A>__{wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at cheltham, whose eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{you disrespect a banner of truce?!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{from his king? absolutely. here are scotland's terms. lower your flags and march straight to england, stopping at every scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. do that, and your men shall live. do it not, and every one of you will die today.}
<A>__{cheltham barks at the scottish nobles...}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{you are outmatched! you haven't even any cavalry! in two centuries no army has won without it!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i'm not finished. before we let you leave, your commander must cross that bridge, stand before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass.}
<A>__{the outraged englishman gallops back to his lines.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{i'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{be ready, and do exactly as i say.}
<A>__{they return to the scottish lines. wallace dismounts where his men are breaking out new 14 foot spears. hamish, eyebrows raised, looks expectantly at wallace; wallace nods.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{wish i could see the noble lord's face when he tells him.}
<A>__{lord talmadge, at his command post the husky english commander's blood boils from cheltham's report. before he can respond, they see wallace's spearmen taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. suddenly the scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the english!}
<C>__{talmadge}
<D>__{insolent bastard! full attack! give no quarter! and i want this wallace's heart brought to me on a plate!}
<A>__{cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...}
