<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{rob is standing shelves. a very pretty young woman, caroline, comes through the door and looks around. she sees rob.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm looking for deejay rob gordon.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{uh. that's me.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm caroline fortis from the reader. i want to do a story on you.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{right. why?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, i used to go to the dodger on your nights, and i saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then and now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh. okay.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i thought i would ask you a few questions if that's okay.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{huh. you used to come to the club? i shouldn't have let you in. you must have only been about sixteen.}
<A>__{rob realizes what he must be sounding like. he blushes and retreats.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what i mean is, i didn't mean you look young. you don't. you don't look old either. you look just as old as you are. a bit younger maybe, but not a lot. not much. just right.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{so. is now a good time?}
<A>__{rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in the store. he nods. she pulls out a pad and pencil.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{right. so. you must have an enormous record collection.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah. i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.}
<A>__{he winces immediately.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{yeah, well... let's see... what are you're all time top five records?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{your desert island top five.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh boy... in the club, or at home?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{is there a difference?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(a little too shrill)}
<D>__{of course... well yeah, a bit. "sin city" by the flying burrito brothers is an all time top five, but i wouldn't play it at the club. it's a country rock ballad. everybody'd go home.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{nevermind. any five. so four more.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what do you mean, four more?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well if one of them is this "sin city" thing }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{can i go home and work this out and let you know? in a week or so?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. i will do one. my five favorite from the old days at the dodger.}
<A>__{rob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, i'm sure i can manage something... "sin city." "new rose," by the damned. "hit it and quit it" by funkadelic. "shipbuilding," elvis costello, japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "mystery train" by elvis presley... and... "spaced cowboy" by sly and the family stone. a bit controversial, i know, but...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{fine. that's great.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{is that it?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sure, but is that it for the list?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{that's five. so. why did you decide to deejay again?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. so...}
<P>__{(looking over her pad at the list)}
<D>__{i should really put a james brown in there }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{nice friend.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{who? oh. my friend. my friend is laura. a girl. a friend who's a girl.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{"music for old people." what does that mean?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry about this, but i'd like "the upsetter" by lee "scratch" perry, in there. instead of "sin city."}
<A>__{she scribbles and writes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{okay. "dance music for old people?"}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{and the new label? and the kinky wizards?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, well, the kinky wizards are you know what? why don't i just make you a tape?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{would you? really? wow. i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{haha. right. it's no problem. i love making tapes.}
