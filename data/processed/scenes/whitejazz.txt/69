<A>__{check my hamilton: 7:32 am. a car pulls into the parking lot. two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious: process servers if ever i've seen them. one of them bears a sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. no answer. they knock rude. i roll down my window. dan wilhite answers in a robe: groggy pissed hungover. before he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the pair depart. wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope and reading what's inside...then rereading it. gauge his reaction: ruined. he puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him. another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.}
