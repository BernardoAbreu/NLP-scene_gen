<L>__{interior the grim house kitchen day}
<A>__{moments later. fay, still dressed in black, is tapping away on the keys to the computer, surfing the internet, as henry appears at the kitchen door, gripping his tall double espresso.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hello, fay.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you gotta get outta the house, fay. you can't blame yourself for not being here. you did all you could for her.}
<A>__{she turns and glares at him.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{is there something you want?}
<A>__{henry stops, pauses, looks away. then...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you got the internet on that contraption?}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(resumes typing)}
<D>__{yeah. so what?}
<A>__{he changes the subject again, preoccupied and continues tenderly...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{look fay, about, you know, between us what happened...}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{i don't wanna talk about it, henry!}
<A>__{he sighs and drinks his coffee, then looks back at her.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{type a part of simon's poem onto the internet.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{because.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{come on, fay. it's a great idea.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{i don't know if he would want us to do that.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{sure he would. just the first ten verses.}
<A>__{fay is tempted.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{he'll thank you for it later.}
<A>__{frowning, she reconsiders. she gets up and takes the notebooks from the cabinet above the fridge. she flips through the pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer attitude.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{henry...}
<A>__{but he's gone. it's as if he has vanished into thin air. she sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the internet.}
