<L>__{exterior hemery high football field wider shot day}
<A>__{opening credits over: a football game in progress. the stands are pretty full, the crowd enthusiastic. the hemery football stadium is just that; a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass. on the sidelines are the hemery cheerleaders, led by buffy. she is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very gracefully athletic. she obviously enjoys what she is doing, and she's good at it. with her on the squad are jennifer and nicole, two of her best friends. beside them the coach, yelling at the players. the scoreboard reads hemery vs. seton. on the field are jeffrey, wide receiver (and buffy's boyfriend), andy, quarterback, and grueller, the huge left tackle. buffy and the crowd wince as andy is sacked for a nine yard loss.}

<D>__{come on, do the play! the one where... the one from the book! where you make it go forward!}
<A>__{the players huddle.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{all right, guys, come on!}

<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{grueller! fill that hole! they were all over me! okay. let's run twenty two. grueller, close the pocket, watch out for thirty five. thompson, run the post, right, wide out. jeffrey, go up the middle and run around like a chicken.}
<A>__{they clap and break. as they line up, jeffrey looks over at buffy. she smiles at him. he winks, very suave.}
<C>__{buffy and cheerleaders}
<D>__{jeffrey! jeffrey! he's our man! if he can't do it we don't want it!}
<A>__{on the hike, andy drops back and looks for a receiver. jeffrey runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving his arms until andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a touchdown. the crowd goes wild particularly buffy, who does an impressive standing backflip. nicole looks at her, impressed. buffy smiles at her, giddy.}
