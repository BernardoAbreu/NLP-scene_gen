<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{mom?}
<A>__{but sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{meg looks at her. as she watches, sarah floats away from her. in fact, the entire room is floating away from her, elongating. and narrowing. meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in on her. meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out. sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly narrow hall.}

<C>__{meg}
<D>__{not here... not here... someplace else... someplace else...}
<A>__{her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and she loses her balance, falling over onto her back. we fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy green. she sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in fact somewhere else, she's }
