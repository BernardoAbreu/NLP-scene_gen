<L>__{exterior westwood street corner next day}
<A>__{catch waits on a busy street corner in westwood village not far from santa monica. he is waiting, glancing over the passing crowds for sharon. he sees her. she is off duty, out of uniform. he watches her until she spots him. she smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and sadness in her smile. they walk to each other and stop and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking slowly, and he walks beside her. there is a strain lingering between them.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{shar, i'm sorry about yesterday. i...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{it's hard to explain, but it's... i'm okay now.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you don't have to explain.}
<A>__{he glances at her, wondering, walking along.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{so... why'd we meet here?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{so you're the trumpet player who was waking people up on my beat.}
<A>__{they walk along in silence a moment.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i used to practice late... outside. on my roof.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{on your roof? that's why we couldn't find you.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it. you arresting me?}
<A>__{they smile nervous smiles. she walks on, leading him somewhere. he looks about, beginning to show some agitation, but covering it.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you going to tell me where we're going?}
<P>__{(as she doesn't answer)}
<D>__{that's okay. i mean... i will go anywhere with you, shar. jaws of death. the mall on a saturday. just about any...}
<A>__{he slows his steps, looking across the street and down half a block...}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{we see an ivy covered brick building there, with a sign that is too far away for us to read.}
<B>__{on catch and sharon}
<A>__{he looks quickly away from that building. she sees his growing agitation.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you can trust me, you know.}
<A>__{she takes his hand.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i've got you now. i'm holding on like before.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{what d'you mean?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{like i held you before. like i did at the accident.}
<A>__{he suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it shakes her.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what makes it so... unspeakable, catch? what makes it like that?}
<A>__{he begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not hear this.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is it because you were driving?}
<A>__{he turns away, closing his eyes.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. it wasn't. is it because you survived and they didn't?}
<A>__{she puts her hand out for him again.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{catch. please. hold on, and we'll go in there together...}
<A>__{he does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a few steps toward that building.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you can talk to them. you can say goodbye or i love you or whatever...}
<A>__{he pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of rage over his pain.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{this is wrong! it's wrong! why are you doing this?!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{to help you.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i don't need your help! i don't need this. we don't need this we're fine...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{we're not. we're not fine, catch. nothing is fine no matter how much you pretend.}
<A>__{it is as if she's fighting for his life again and her own.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you pretend that nothing happened. you walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i'm not dying! i'm not pretending! i don't remember! i don't remember any of it. so leave me alone! what good does it do? it's gone! and i'm all right this way! why do you have to change it? i'm all right.}
<A>__{she points at the building across the street.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{then walk in there.}
<A>__{he can't even look at the place.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{walk in there, and i will walk in with you. walk in there and say it's real what happened is real. your family died.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{don't talk about that! don't!}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{all right you talk about it! you tell me your family died and i say yes, i know, i'm sorry, and you say, i loved them... and i say, what an awful thing to lose a family...}
<C>__{catch}
<P>__{(unravelling)}
<D>__{damn you, shar. damn you why won't you stop?!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{so you can have a life!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i have a life! we could have a life. we could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk about before. we don't need to do that! why do we need to do that?!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{because it happened! because it's the truth! i'm sorry. i'm so sorry it happened, but...}
<C>__{catch}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{catch take my hand. please.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{say it! i'm asking you to say it.}
<A>__{her tears come, and she shakes her head.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{because i want it too much. i want everything with you. i want all of you not just the part that isn't hiding and running away...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why are you pushing so hard? why does it have to be your way? why does it have to be your truth? this is who i am! this is the way i am!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{not anymore. it doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone because we're the family now. we can be the family...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you like to push people, don't you? you just have to push and shove and make it right for you for you. you push everybody, shar. you even pushed your family away, didn't you?}
<A>__{he has stung her. the tears are in her throat. she has to take a moment, but she pushes through to say quietly...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i just... want to say...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you already said it. you said it all.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{when you're ready, i will be there for you. i just want to say that.}
<A>__{and she turns and walks away. he watches her go, angry, scared and sorry for what he said. he takes a few steps after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. we see him almost call to her. he is coming apart, watching her, needing her so much, but unable to call out. he is shaky. he takes a glance at that building, then away. he stares after sharon but she's out of sight now. he steels himself, then looks across the street again at that building. he is desperately afraid. he stares at the building a long while. he begins to cross the street. he makes fists to keep from shaking. he walks to the entrance.}
