<A>__{montage of smoking, drinking, and carousing. the parquet floor is packed with swinging hepsters dressed in hollywood's take on forties threads. the dancing is full blown overcrowded slam swing. the floor is full, and everyone is damn good. this definitely aint amateur night.}

<A>__{mike steps up to the bar to refill his drink. he sees a brunette sitting at the bar. she's cute. real cute. she glows. there's something fresh about her. she's dressed nice, but different. she definitely is not a regular. she throws mike a half smile, then looks away. he looks away. should he? he shakes his head to himself. no. beat. he looks over at her again. mike's p.o.v. of a white bunny sitting on the bar stool. he smiles, shrugs, and crosses to her. when he gets to her she has reverted back to human form.}
