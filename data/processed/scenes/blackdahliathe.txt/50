<A>__{bucky pulls his .38... the white guy swings around and lee shoots him twice in the face the first black man pulls a shiv free and bucky shoots him in the neck another of the men goes for his trousers, fumbling for something as bucky shoots him three times.}

<A>__{bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of lee and the last man drawing guns on each other lee's three shots cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer. bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter. from the distance: the sound of sirens. bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket. behind him, lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside out scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from the blood. all the while lee cries like a baby.}
