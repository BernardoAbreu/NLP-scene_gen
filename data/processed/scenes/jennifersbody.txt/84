<A>__{the gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest. a large banner reads "through the trees turnabout dance" there are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly shades of green and purple. a dj plays badly mixed pop music. couples drift into the gym. the goth kids who were at colin gray's grave travel in a pack, sulking. the goth girl who loved colin wanders through the decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin. as she pops them, she narrates dramatically.}

<A>__{the girls glare at each other. needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad `80s dress. she looks around for chip, but he's not there yet. a few mean kids point at her dress and snicker. needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans against the wall, waiting anxiously for her prince charming.}
