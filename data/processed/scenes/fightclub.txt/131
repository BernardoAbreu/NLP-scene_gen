<L>__{interior jack's office day}
<A>__{jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer, smoking a cigarette. boss enters.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{he was wearing a yellow tie. it must be thursday. i didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.}
<A>__{boss slaps a piece of paper down on jack's desk.}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{"the first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."}
<A>__{jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i must've left the original in the copy machine.}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{"the second rule of fight club... is this yours?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{you don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{"abuse" the copy machine. there's an image.}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{pretend you're me. you find this. what would you do?}
<A>__{jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{me? i'd be very careful who i talked to about this. it sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an armalite ar 10 carbine gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co workers.}
<A>__{jack moves very close to boss, picks up the paper and starts tearing it into pieces.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{might be someone you've known for years... somebody very close to you. or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.}
<A>__{jack puts the paper in his trash. bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear. phone rings. jack answers it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{compliance and liability.}
<C>__{marla's voice}
<D>__{my tit's going to rot off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just a second.}
<P>__{(to boss; smiles)}
<D>__{could you excuse me? i need to take this call.}
<A>__{boss goes to the door, stares at jack a beat, then leaves.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
