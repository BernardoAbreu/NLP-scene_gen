<L>__{interior charlie's saloon day}
<A>__{as haven enters. he is dusty and tired from his long walk. the place is moderately busy. med. shot of haven as he sits tiredly at a table where charlie and prince are sitting. she smiles at him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i thought you were in jail.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i talked my way out.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're a very glib man. you seem to talk your way out of everything.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{up to a certain pointerior}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{a gun.}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{champagne.}
<A>__{the waiter exits. charlie looks at haven curiously.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{are we celebrating something?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{you know, the first time i talked to you we had champagne.}
<P>__{(smiling at her)}
<D>__{i think i should have been a missionary and gone to china after all.}
<A>__{he takes out the pipe, twirls it in his fingers. the waiter puts down the champagne. charlie is looking at haven with puzzlement and curiosity. the waiter goes...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{didn't you bring me something?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but you will?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{her face changes; hardens. she glances across at prince. haven watches prince with a smile.}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no just like that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's easy to explain. it's just a little hard to believe.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{make it as credible as you can.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling grimly)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<P>__{(filling the pipe)}
<D>__{i went to get it, and it was there. but so was somebody else.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{mrs. caslon.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{alone?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no... she had a gun with her.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{did you have one too?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{the one she had was in her hand.}
<A>__{there is a silence. prince stares idly at the dice cubes in his hand. charlie stares straight at haven. haven glances at prince.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{this could be that slip you mentioned.}
<A>__{prince just stares at him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to haven)}
<D>__{so this nice lady held you up and took the gold, is that it?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's like saying i got robbed at sunday school. it's no good, is it?}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{no, it isn't.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i even had to walk back to town. i think that may be one of the longest walks i ever took.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{and one of the last.}
<A>__{haven takes a sip of the champagne, charlie's whole manner has now changed. it is cold and very quiet.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{mick might have killed you, but you fought him with your fists. the sheriff had a gun but you took it away from him. ben had a gun last night but it didn't seem to scare you. now this genteol petticoat waves a pistol and you run for your life.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(twirling the}
<D>__{wineglass, glancing}
<P>__{at charlie)}
<D>__{he makes it sound very silly.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{or i make it sound like what it is: a lie!}
<P>__{(he rises)}
<A>__{haven reaches in his pocket for a match. prince, mistaking the gesture, swiftly extracts a small pistol from his belt, covers him.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{haven extracts the match, with a glance of contempt at prince; then lights the pipe again.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling faintly)}
<D>__{my word doesn't seem very good around here.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{you've only got one thing left that's any good here and that's some gold.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{is that all i've got?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not quite. you've got some time. you've got two hours to get it here.}
<A>__{there is a brief silence that punctuates this statement. it has an air of fatal finality, marked by the idle music of the deaf pianist. haven puts his pipe away, carefully so that prince won't get any mistaken ideas.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you want me to fatten you up before you kill me? is that what you mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i said what i meant two hours.}
<A>__{haven rises. he brushes some dust off his coat, smiles thinly at charlie.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i once knew a guy who stole a dime tip from a lunch counter and parlayed it into fifty thousand. i might try that but not in two hours.}
<A>__{she says nothing; her face carved out of ice. prince smiles thinly. haven looks at him, shrugs. he hesitates; then pats charlie's frigid shoulder.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{you're sweet.}
<A>__{he turns and walks slowly out. the dirge of the piano follows him. prince fingers his pistol a little, tempted. at a look from charlie he puts it away. haven goes out. charlie suddenly leaves the tables and goes quickly up the stairs. prince watches her with a slow smile, picks up haven's gun and pockets it...}
