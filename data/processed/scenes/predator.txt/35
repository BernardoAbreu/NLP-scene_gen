<A>__{mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert, intense, almost nervous. he moves on, his huge body barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy undergrowth. dillon appears. as he moves on, he crosses over a fallen tree. stepping down, his foot breaks through a rotten portion, a chuck of the log breaking free and rolling down the hill. dillon at once goes into a defensive position, listening. the jungle is silent. he stands and starts to move forward. suddenly mac appears within inches of dillon's face. mac's face is menacing, angry.}

<P>__{(hisses; spits)}
<D>__{got it?}
<A>__{dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in cold hatred at mac, controlling his rage...he knows the rules. not waiting for a response, mac turns and vanished into the jungle. seething with anger dillon focuses on a still moving leaf and stem, indicating mac's exit pointerior he moves on.}
