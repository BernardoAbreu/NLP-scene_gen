<A>__{a rumble of distant thunder follows the lightning that flashes from the dark clouds hanging on the horizon. looking incomplete without its trailer, the tractor cab of a mack truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing jenny and the star man standing on the gravel. the star man looks back to where they came from. there is nothing coming so he sets out in the other direction.}

<A>__{the star man ignores her and continues to walk.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(shouts at him)}
<D>__{even if we walk five miles, it's not going to make any difference.}
<A>__{jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb. the star man falls into the same pose just back of her. the car honks at them as it breezes by.}
