<A>__{winters, humes, clayton and joe kane sit across from darnell jefferson and reverend wallace in a tattered parlor room. other boys of various ages and color look in from the adjoining door. darnell is black, good looking, street hip, the letters d.j. shaved in block letters into his fade.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{darnell, you have the potential to start for us as a freshman. that 108 yard kickoff return you made against taft? one of the greatest runs i've ever seen a high school player make. now, michigan is set at tailback for two years. you won't play till you're a junior. with joe here gettin' you the ball, runnin' 28 thunder right, you'll be all american with us as a sophomore.}
<C>__{reverend wallace}
<D>__{yes, but i'm really more concerned with darnell's education. he came here late. he's got some catching up to do.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{believe me, education is the first priority in our program. that's why all the players are smarter than me. after all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important.}
<A>__{this gets a little chuckle from the reverend. it was intended to.}
