<L>__{exterior dickie's mooring. day.}
<A>__{the bird returns to the mooring by dickie's house. dickie as ever captain of the ship, clambering around, shouting instructions, with ripley, marge and freddie as crew. ripley looks back at shore. silvana stands watching, staring. dickie notices her too.}
<L>__{exterior mongibello slipway. late day.}
<A>__{a woman's head suddenly breaks the surface of the water. it's a statue of the virgin mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil. as she is revealed, wooden, staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette, wading towards the shore, the madonna aloft on their shoulders. the whole town of mongibello is in attendance for this annual festival of the madonna del mare, either standing in their fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the parish priest and altar boys and incense. ripley, dickie and marge watch from dickie's terrace. there are hymns and, as the statue is carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves, the congregation applauds at the illusion that the madonna is walking on water. suddenly another head appears on the surface of the water, about fifty yards from the statue. there's a scream from among the crowd as someone notices the body. it's silvana. one of the men carrying the statue turns first towards the direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse. it's silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the palette, causing it to topple, and in absolute grief wades, swims, splashes towards the body. pandemonium in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people splashing, fully clothed, into the water. from the terrace, ripley turns and looks at dickie, catching his eye.}
