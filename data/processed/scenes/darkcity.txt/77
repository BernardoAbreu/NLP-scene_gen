<L>__{interior tenement building corridor}
<A>__{low angle tracking shot feet walk along a tattered rug, approach a door. bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.}
<L>__{interior tenement room}
<A>__{a knock on the door startles a huddled man in a blanket, sitting before a small t.v. set. this is thompson the detective with mental problems. he's unshaven, haunted. clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy hole.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch. thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the door.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{go away!}
<C>__{bumstead o.s.}
<D>__{open up, thompson. it's me...}
<A>__{thompson puts his eye to the door again.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{bumstead?}
<A>__{through the spy hole lens the inspector turns, looks at us, his face distorted, fish like. thompson undoes four locks, opens the door a crack, but leaves it chained.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{can't let you in... sorry.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{not that. anything else.}
<A>__{thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{you don't look so well... c'mon, let me in thompson.}
<A>__{thompson stares at bumstead, then silently unchains the door and lets him through.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i can't talk about that . as long as you understand, that's all.}
<A>__{the room is very dark. bumstead is assailed by a wave of putrid smells. it's a mess rotten food, overturned furniture, dirty clothes.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{pull up some garbage make yourself at home.}
<A>__{thompson smiles weakly. they sit down, face each other in the gloom. a rat scuttles past thompson. with lightning reflexes he throws a shoe at it. the rat runs under a table. he looks back at bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{they've taken my mind, my memories...}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{what? who has?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{is that your idea of a joke? i don't remember...}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{take my advice, bumstead. get off this case. now.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{what is going on?}
<C>__{thompson }
<D>__{wish i could tell you, bumstead. strange business. i... aaaaaaahhhhhhhh !}
<A>__{he screams horribly. stands, clutching his head. startled, bumstead falls backwards off his chair. thompson, still clutching his head, runs and starts pounding his face against the wall.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{get away! leave me alone!}
<A>__{thompson's head is changing bloating. it rapidly elongates into a pink fleshy tube. thompson's head continues to grow his features are lost beneath folds of skin. his screaming is stifled. thompson falls to the floor. his head huge now larger than his body. small tendrils sprout from the main appendage. bumstead takes cover behind a sofa. then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops. bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple growth sprouting from thompson's collar. at the top of the growth an orifice opens. an explosion of green bile spouts into the room covers everything in sight... then the head starts to shrink. thompson's features appear again. it returns to normal size. thompson groans, sprawled on the floor, clutching his head. bumstead looks on in horror.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{it's it's disgusting, i know...}
<A>__{thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat. his nose starts to bleed he wipes it on his sleeve.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{jesus! we have to get you to a doctor...}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{no... no doctor...}
<A>__{bumstead stands unsteadily.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{but... how long has this been happening?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{a few days... a few weeks dunno, i can't remember.}
<P>__{(stands slowly)}
<D>__{worse thing is, i never know if it will change back again... now, please leave me alone.}
