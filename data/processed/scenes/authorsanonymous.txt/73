<A>__{alan steps outside. somber. focused. acts like the terminator in his scanning of the area. man on a mission. what is he looking for? he finds it almost immediately, zeroing in on colette's bench. alan marches over and grabs colette's prized framed photo of oprah. clutching it in his hand, alan looks at oprah's smiling face, then back towards the house. then he takes the frame and smashes it down on the ground as hard as he can. next he jumps up and down on the smashed frame multiple times. not satisfied, alan bends down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands. there. that felt good. pool guy and gardener have witnessed the whole scene. what the hell? they exchange puzzled looks.}
