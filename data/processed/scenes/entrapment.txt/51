<L>__{exterior golden gate bridge, san francisco late night}
<A>__{close on gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see, as mist floats up between us. it is a carabiner with a nylon rope attached, and she clips it to a thick wire.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i'm freezing my tender parts.}
<A>__{pull back to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly vertical cable, three feet in diameter. enveloped in fog which reveals, then conceals.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{i'm relieved to hear you have some.}
<A>__{pull way back to see him below her. the two of them climbing the golden gate bridge. they are near the top, more than 700 feet above the silvery black bay. a precarious, dizzying sight.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{what's amazing, is that only eleven workers died during construction of this thing...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{...thanks for sharing...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{of course, the others were saved by a safety net.}
<A>__{gin keeps her focus on the small railed platform just above her. a gutsy gal.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{now, as for the suicides, they always jump facing the city. avoids that tall fence about 50 stories down, see it, there?}
<A>__{she's at the platform.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i never liked you.}
<A>__{unclips one last time. this won't be easy. throws her rope over the railing, and to her surprise, mac braces himself with his legs... ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily to the platform. grateful, she hates to confess it.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{one act of fucking human kindness...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{call it a lapse.}
<A>__{and he swings lightly up beside her. the fog has rolled past. there are several million stars. transcendent beauty. she slows her breath...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and how does this fit into the game pl...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{oh, it doesn't. we came for the view.}
<A>__{and from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of cristal. flutes, wrapped in velvet. he pops the cork in one motion, and it sails to its watery doom. she can't help but watch. one more motion to pour both glasses. hands one to her. toasts...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{to ginger baker.}
<A>__{he clicks her glass. she stares straight in his eye. shows no surprise, no fear...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm partial to drummers. if they played with clapton and winwood.}
<A>__{and takes a sip. cool as a goose. licks her lips.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the prescription bottle. when you stole my suitcase.}
<A>__{but he's not drinking. only staring. the wind has picked up.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{armand baker was my husband, may 13 to october 27, 1982, he played alto sax, i was 17 years old.}
<A>__{she takes another sip. good wine.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{he named me ginger. he likes drummers, too.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and you get sentimental for him. every time you order drugs.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i have i.d. in that name. i use it for various things i don't want traced. when credit unions turn their computers my way.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i could listen to you lie all night.}
<A>__{she toasts him.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{same here, fella.}
<A>__{slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she flinches. her eyes do flicker. and follow. he withdraws not a pistol, but a handful of...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{do you like diamonds?}
<A>__{nine diamonds, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes from bugging. wow.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you asked. does the machine. make gold.}
<A>__{holy. christ.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{gold is shit. it's six thousand dollars a pound. worth your weight in gold...?}
<A>__{his eyes travel her body...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{that would put you at seven hundred thousand.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{would you pay it?}
<A>__{and he leans. looks in her eyes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{when the light hits you just right. i'd pay more.}
<A>__{she liked that. maybe a lot.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the machine. that we are stealing. makes diamonds?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{real ones?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{gem quality. first ever. god save japan.}
<A>__{he toasts blessed japan to the east. takes a hit.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{a diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning tunnel mg microscopes.}
<A>__{he means this. she is transfixed.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{this one uses krypton fluorine laser, with a new isotope of krypton.}
<A>__{she looks down at the diamonds in his palm. his fist closes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the atoms are rearranged. and the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of...}
<A>__{he turns his fist upside down. and lets go! she gasps as the brilliant stones fall toward the sea. watching, watching, long after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated. a hush.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i hate it. when you make a pointerior}
