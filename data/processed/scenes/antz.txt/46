<L>__{interior formica's chambers day}
<A>__{formica sits at his desk, going over some plans. formica's chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door. the walls are hung with trophies the heads of other insects. ant team six burst in the doors of formica's office, carrying the struggling and kicking bala. one of the commandoes sets the tracker ant one the floor...then formica gets up from his desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{princess bala. good.}
<P>__{(with urgency)}
<D>__{where's z?}
<A>__{bala replies warily.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{he's...he's dead.}
<P>__{(covering for z)}
<D>__{you don't have to look for him anymore. he was eaten by a praying mantis.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(regretfully)}
<D>__{it's a shame he died prematurely...i was hoping to kill him myself.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i miss him already.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you miss him? why?}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{because...because he's twice the ant that you are. i could never go through with marrying you. i'm i'm an individual, and when i get married, it'll be to someone i choose.}
<A>__{the soldiers look shocked. for a moment, formica looks furious. then he just shrugs.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{princess bala, i'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. but one thing i do know is, there are more princesses where you came from. i just hope they're not all like you. in the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see z again after all.}
<A>__{he gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door. we notice that the tracker ant has been left behind.}
