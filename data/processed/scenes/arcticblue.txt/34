<L>__{exterior sportsmen's camp later that day}
<A>__{everything seems peaceful enough. the sos fire (made from burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black smoke) has burnt down to embers. eric, anne marie and wilder pull up in wilder's pickup. the two sportsmen sit in the front seat of the land rover, but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers. in the back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass. something is amiss. eric shoots a look of trepidation at anne marie as they get out of the pickup. wilder pulls the door of the land rover open. a sportsman slumps out onto the ground. his eyes are open and his tongue pokes out between his lips. his skin is blue white. (he looks, in fact, much like eric's nightmare.) startled, eric steps back. anne marie gasps with horror. wilder unzips the sportsman's light windbreaker and listens for a heartbeat. nothing.}
<C>__{wilder}
<D>__{stupid goddamn greenhorns! froze to death.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{it's not even winter!}
<C>__{wilder}
<D>__{they got wet in the rain. core body temperature dropped, got drowsy, probably didn't even know what was happening.}
<A>__{eric stares at the dead sportsmen.}
<C>__{wilder}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{question is why they sat here when the storm moved in. check their stuff while i sniff around.}
<A>__{wilder tries the ignition. the starter turns over, but the engine makes a horrendous grinding. he walks to the front of the vehicle. noticing the bullet holes in the grille, he bends down for a closer look.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful supplies. still in their packages are some matchbox sized elt locating beacons.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{they had emergency locater transmitters, but didn't use them.}
<P>__{(opens one up; shakes his head)}
<D>__{maybe because they didn't bring batteries.}
<B>__{close}
<A>__{anne marie opens the back door of the land rover. she pulls back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third sportsman. the torn red flesh on his head and his bugged out eyes are a hideous sight. anne marie screams and stumbles away.}
