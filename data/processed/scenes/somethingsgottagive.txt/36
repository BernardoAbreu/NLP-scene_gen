<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{erica and harry enter from opposite sides of the room, both in their pajamas.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we are cute...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{this is pretty unusual for me. i'm not used to having sleepovers.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{me either.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{really? with your social life?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping. sleeping is something i prefer to do alone.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{okay, good to know.}
<P>__{(heading for the kitchen)}
<D>__{so, what are you hungry for?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(joining her)}
<D>__{what are my choices? i mean i know you think i'm not very discriminating but...}
<A>__{she looks through the fridge.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, god, what's the difference what i think. i can't imagine what you think of me. okay, so... pasta, left over coq au vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{pancakes.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{totally what i wanted. blueberries?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you ever miss being married? i bet you were great at it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{sometimes i miss it. at night.. but not that much anymore. was one of us just saying something interesting?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you said you can't imagine what i think of you.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, right, but you don't have to answer that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i mean, if you had an opinion, i'd be curious but...'}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night?}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(cracking eggs)}
<D>__{oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. but i got the hang of it. you gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. it's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side.}
<A>__{she starts mixing the batter.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, now i'm convinced what i think of you is right.}
<P>__{(erica waits. . . )}
<D>__{you are a tower of strength.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(shoulders sagging)}
<D>__{ughhhhhhhhhh... .}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{try not to rate my answer.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just...i'm sorry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts. no, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace. words have been invented to describe women like you.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{( fearful)}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{flinty and...impervious.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{so you think i'm inhuman.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. i think you're formidable.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{but cold and distant. like i'm frozen in some painting...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not at all. i think you're strength defines you.}
<P>__{(sees how sensitive she is)}
<D>__{but it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated. that, i believe, is your winning combo. a killer combo actually.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{... so i can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't hate you.}
<A>__{the moment is broken when they hear the front door open and}
<B>__{high heels approaching.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{marin arrives in the doorway in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from zabars. she looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{room service!}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what are you doing here at this hour?}
<A>__{erica and harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents. harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair. erica catches all this.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(enters, kisses erica)}
<D>__{i had this big photography auction tonight, then i went out with a bunch of people, i checked my messages and got this so sad message from harry so bored out here. i thought i should come out and at least see how he was doing.}
<P>__{(kisses harry on the cheek)}
<D>__{thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way. they were so huge...}
<A>__{erica nods to herself. oh, god, he sends them all flowers. harry notes erica's reaction.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{so how are you guys?}
<P>__{(sets down the zabar's bag)}
<D>__{oh, this is too sweet. you're making pancakes? awwww. and you're both in your pj's. now i feel i'm interrupting.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{don't be silly. you know i never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either. it's... .what's in the bag?}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(reaches into the bag)}
<D>__{a quart of matzoh ball soup for harry. i know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(hating to correct her)}
<D>__{but high sodium.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, sorry. stupid. for mom, your favorite raisin bread. and for me...}
<P>__{(reaches into the bag)}
<D>__{my favorite vodka.}
<A>__{marin's cell phone rings.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello? no i'm here, babe. made record time. everyone's still there?}
<A>__{erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. harry watches her. she catches him and shrugs. marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{so, mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and i will get back to work...}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{mom! i just got here, hold on.}
<A>__{she pours a healthy vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{so your ex husband stood me up today. we were supposed to have lunch at barneys . he never showed up. was he always like this?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{honey, i don't know...}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{this is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. not that i'm a kid.}
<P>__{(then to harry, the flirt in her coming back)}
<D>__{so how are you, how do you feel? when can you go home?}
<A>__{just as harry is about to answer, marin's cell rings. she picks it up, looks at her caller id, throws it back in her bag.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i really am gonna do a little work. . . you two catch up. . . and just flip these hin like two seconds.}
<C>__{arry}
<D>__{you don't want pancakes anymore?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i, uh, i don't think i...i...}
<P>__{(looks at marin so)}
<D>__{gorgeous, next to him no. i don't.}
<A>__{marin watches her mother exit then looks to harry, his eyes following her mom out the door. she's sees a look on harry's face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. at first she's shocked. he likes my mother??? then a flash of jealousy. he likes my mother!?! then pure joy realizing how perfect it is.}
