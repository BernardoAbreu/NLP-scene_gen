<L>__{interior san de chamber same day}
<A>__{establishing shot of drew, gao and san de in the shadows of san de's}
<B>__{room.}
<A>__{san de is sitting down reading a buddhist texterior with a sigh, he puts it down. on the wall behind is hanging a golden sash.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{so soon?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me what happened.}
<A>__{drew looks at gao, and gao looks at drew. there is a pause, one that is very uncomfortable. finally, drew speaks.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it was my fault. i started it.}
<B>__{angle on gao}
<A>__{surprised at drew's confession.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{disciple gao was better than me.}
<A>__{drew pauses, and gao is even more surprised at the revelation.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i lost my temper. he was only defending himself.}
<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{who nods his head and looks at drew.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{is this true, disciple gao?}
<A>__{gao looks at drew, wondering what he should say. drew looks at him, nodding for him to say yes.}
<C>__{gao}
<D>__{yes. but, i am not completely blameless...}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{i didn't think you were...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. we challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. never do we fight to see who is best we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. a shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shake hands and let your emotions go.}
<A>__{gao looks at drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept away in the shock of drew taking the blame. they shake hands. both drew and gao notice the golden sash hanging on the wall. it is occupying a place of honor.}
<C>__{san de }
<D>__{that is the golden sash, the highest honor of the temple. it is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle of understanding.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{the best fighter?}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{among other things. fighting is only a small part of being a shaolin monk.}
<C>__{gao}
<D>__{yours?}
<A>__{san de nods.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{return to your training.}
<A>__{drew and gao get up, bow to san de and head for the door. they get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door. finally, drew tires of the game and opens the door for gao.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{ten more seconds and i would have kicked your ass...}
<A>__{gao smiles and walks through the door. just as he passes drew, he punches him in the stomach.}
<C>__{gao}
<D>__{in your dreams...}
