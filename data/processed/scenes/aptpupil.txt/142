<A>__{todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the boxes and boxes of ammunition. he lets out a beautifully wicked laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack. he leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his shoulder.}
<L>__{exterior bowden house driveway street day}
<A>__{todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over one shoulder, the backpack over the other. he zips past french's body and out into the street. in the distance, we hear the faint, but rising wail of sirens. a front door or two slams shut as todd passes. suddenly he cuts up between two houses. a man standing in his back yard sees todd and freezes. todd ignores him. he steers the bike through the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times before.}
