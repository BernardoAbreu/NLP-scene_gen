<L>__{exterior orchard, near cider house moments later}
<A>__{smiling his enigmatic smile, mr. rose keeps slowly picking while homer stands at the foot of his ladder.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{i didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. you look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{is it true?}
<A>__{mr. rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{are you sleeping with your own daughter?}
<A>__{mr. rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<P>__{(slyly; still composed)}
<D>__{i think you been stayin' up too late at night, homer.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you're actually having sex with your own little girl? is that possible?}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{ain't nobody havin' sex with my little girl, homer that's somethin' a father knows.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you're lying. how can you... with your own daughter!}
<A>__{mr. rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{homer, don't you know what business you in? you don't wanna go into no business with me, homer ain't that right?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{go on, cut my clothes. i've got other clothes.}
<A>__{mr. rose is indignant.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you a fine one to be talkin' about lies. shame! these people took you in. that boy wally's at war!}
<A>__{that takes some of the steam out of homer's superiority.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{but she's your daughter...}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{and i love her! there ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as i do!}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{i wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, homer you must know that.}
<A>__{homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{she's pregnant. do you know that?}
<A>__{by his expression he looks as if he's been punched it's clear that mr. rose didn't know that. the other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious that muddy, peaches, and hero already know that mr. rose is sleeping with his daughter.}
