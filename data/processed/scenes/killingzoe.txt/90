<L>__{interior bank vault antechamber day}
<A>__{zed is drilling now with a hand drill. he removes it and blows into the hole. shavings come out. eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling.}

<D>__{what's going on?}

<D>__{fucked up my drill bit.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it's okay. you can buy another one.}
<A>__{zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the two prongs into the hole.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{cross your fingers.}

<C>__{zed}
<D>__{perfect.}
