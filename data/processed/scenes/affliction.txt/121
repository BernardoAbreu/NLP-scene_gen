<L>__{exterior pond night}
<A>__{a trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond too sharply for jack. he crashes through a stand of skinny birches straight out onto the pond. the pickup's momentum carries it across the pond. wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting ice. he drives directly to jack, bumper to bumper, headlight to headlight. jack sticks his head out:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you crazy sonofabitch! you'll sink us both! get off the fucking ice! get off!}
<A>__{wade doesn't budge. jack backs away; wade inches forward. hewitt's trapped. trees behind him. neither truck has traction on ice. jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. wade gets out. jacks grabs his rifle, points it:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will shoot you, wade, i swear it! i will fucking shoot you dead if you don't move away from that truck!}
<A>__{wade backs off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't move! i will shoot you dead if you move!}
<A>__{jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the dodge, crosses the ice and is gone. wade stands in darkness. the only sound his idling truck, the wind. then a third sound the snap of ice. ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond. ice planes tip around the truck. lariviere's snazzy dodge slips, descends, disappears. headlights glow under water, then go out. "our business is going in the hole." wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore. freezing, he finds jack's tire tracks in the snow. he bangs his jaw.}
