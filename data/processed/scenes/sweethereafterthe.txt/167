<D>__{it's because of the accident, nicole. most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. a lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. us included.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{but you didn't lose me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no, honey. and we will thank the lord for that every day and night for the rest of our lives. but you almost died, and you were badly injured, and you won't be...you can't...}

<A>__{nicole's p.o.v. of jenny playing on a tree branch.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're going to need special care for a long time to come. it's not going to be easy. not for you, not for any of us. because we love you so much. and it's going to cost money. more than we can imagine.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what about insurance? doesn't insurance pay for these things?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{partly. but there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. that's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{how will he do that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, mr. stephens is representing several families. the ottos, the walkers, us, and i think a couple more. mr. stephens is suing the town for negligence. he's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. he's a very smart man.}
<A>__{nicole stares at her sister who's at the top of the tree. jenny turns to look back at nicole. there's a tension, as it seems as though jenny is going to let herself fall.}
<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{that's the first thing i heard about you. that you were a smart man. that you were so smart that you were going to sue the town, then make us all feel better...}
