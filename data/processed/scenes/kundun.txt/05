<L>__{exterior courtyard day}
<A>__{lhamo straddles the window sill, slapping his bottom as if he were a horse, shouting:}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{i go away. look, mama, i go away. far, far, far.}
<A>__{his mother is making bread in the kitchen.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh, no. where will he go?}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{far, far away.}
<L>__{interior kitchen dusk}
<A>__{lhamo is playing a game with pebbles on the raised, wooden platform in the kitchen. the fire is lit. he is alone. the dog begins to bark.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{good day.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{good day.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{please, come in, so cold.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{we are traveling to lhasa. may we...?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{of course, please, this way. your servant may use the kitchen.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{a middle aged man, the servant, wearing heavy, ragged clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen. lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform beside him. the man picks up a few pebbles and drops them he knows the game. we recognize this servant. his name is keustang rinpoche. he is one of the monks we saw at the oracle lake, the one with the mesmerizing eyes. keustang rinpoche is the lama of sera monastery. lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the servant's neck and immediately pulls at the string of beads.}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{mine.}
<A>__{the servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy. lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck. the servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but lhamo resists.}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{i will give it to, if you can tell me who i am.}
<A>__{lhamo looks up, into the man's piercing, black eyes.}
<C>__{lhamo}
<D>__{the lama of sera. you come.}
<A>__{the mother enters and immediately sees the rosary around her son's neck. she gives it back to the servant.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{lhamo, no.}
<A>__{lhamo goes back to his game. the mother hands the tired man a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea. the man's hands are shaking. he cannot look the woman in the eye.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{thank you.}
