<A>__{a death cart rattles past, bearing its load. pan with it to reveal a scene utterly dante esque. here's where the dead are brought to be burned en masse. fires are burning. smoke is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. soot is drifting like black snow. bodies are dumped into a slit trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. barrels are kicked over. streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking. one of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. the creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of oil. he knows what that means. he pushes free, clambering over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...}
