<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{empty; as before. the door opens and the two thugs we saw earlier with bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys away in his jacket pocket. they close the door, look around the room. one goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom. the first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of clothing. the second comes out of the bathroom. they look at one another. the guy from the bathroom shakes his head. the other one points at the dangling phone, speaks.}
