<A>__{he watches her cautiously, not sure of how to deal with her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{it's all over town about dallas...}
<P>__{(moving towards her)}
<D>__{how is he?}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{a close up. susan's expression is blank; her eyes are unseeing.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he's...unconscious...}
<A>__{there is a tone of great despair in her voice. presently, she recovers, camera eases back to include sidney beyond. she glances at him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i...i gave steve up...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{why did you and j.j. do it?}
<B>__{resume sidney}
<A>__{sidney looks at her, tensely. her voice is so calm, so certain that sidney finds it difficult to play act innocence. he protests a little too loudly:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{susie, if i get your meaning, you're pitching very wild balls. what }
<B>__{resume susan and sidney}
<A>__{susan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't bother to lie, sidney.}
<P>__{(moving away)}
<D>__{i don't care anymore.}
<B>__{longer angle}
<A>__{sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue. he assumes a tolerant sympathy. he moves towards her.}

<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i'm sorry about steve, not myself. i'm even sorry for my brother. to be so lonely, without one real friend in the world to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family }
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(moving towards her again)}
<D>__{come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?}
<A>__{now she turns to him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and i'm sorry for you, too, sidney. you're going down with the ship.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what ship?}
<A>__{she walks past him, still aimlessly wandering about the room; then she turns back, indicates herself.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this ship.}
<A>__{she studies sidney.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't you know how my brother will see you after tonight? you'll be the man who drove his little stainless sister to suicide...}

<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{it's late and i'm going home...}
<A>__{susan, in foreground, remains quite still, says nothing. in background, sidney slows down, his confidence failing him; he looks back at her.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he can't go. probably, she's bluffing. but he can't be certain. he is suddenly angry.}
<B>__{resume susan and sidney}
<A>__{he strides back towards her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{susie, whatever problems you have with j.j. i didn't invent them! what're you blaming me for? if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{like you?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah! like me! i don't choke on my own gall i fight back! let them choke, not me!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm not a man, sidney, i'm }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i know that bit you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! so what do you pick such weak sisters for? don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i didn't do anything!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...but you did it for greed, sidney and that's pathetic.}
<A>__{she moves past him. he grips her, turning her around.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't run away i was always the man for you! i'm talking to you out of two years of silence listen to what i say! inside of six months }
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(helplessly)}
<D>__{please, sidney, i can't stand this }
<A>__{camera holds sidney and susan in foreground. but it is now shooting towards the door of the apartment. a panning movement has included a figure at the other end of the big room...}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{he is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment. we don't know how long he has been there, how much he has overheard. without appearing to be consciously spying, hunsecker is listening to sidney's voice over scene.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(over scene)}
<D>__{listen to me, lunatic! all your life you've been doing penance for crimes you never committed! i could change that, i'd teach you, i'd show you !}
<A>__{camera pans round with hunsecker who strolls across the room, making his presence known. sidney breaks off, drops his hands, releasing the girl. susan turns towards hunsecker. hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table. he addresses susan without looking at her.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{go to bed, susie. it's late...}
<A>__{susan makes no move. hunsecker glances at her, sees sidney but treats sidney as if he were invisible.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{what is he doing here?}
<A>__{susan walks towards hunsecker.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i called him.}
<A>__{sidney moves forward also.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{she was depressed she heard about dallas.}
<A>__{hunsecker still ignores his existence, he walks past susan carrying his papers to the desk. susan turns, watching him.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{("controlling" his feelings)}
<D>__{that subject it might be better not to start me on.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{he's made all the papers tonight.}
<A>__{hunsecker studies the item in the paper.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{she is staring at her brother. suddenly, she is unable to suffer his authoritative air; she goes to him; he ignores her...}
<B>__{hunsecker and susan}
<A>__{childishly, she snatches the paper from his hand, throws it to the floor. he looks at her. patiently, as with a hysterical infant, he stoops, recovers the paper.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{("mildly")}
<D>__{is there something you wanted to say...?}
<P>__{(as she does not}
<D>__{answer, continuing}
<P>__{with growing viciousness)}
<D>__{i've put up with a lot of your guff, susie, because you were a child. but you're a woman now and i suspect, despite my best intentions, more than a bit of a slut...}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{her head comes up sharply at the insult.}
<B>__{hunsecker and susan and sidney}
<A>__{hunsecker glances at sidney, clearly reminding them of the compromising situation in which they were found. sidney moves to answer.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{j.j., if you think }
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{don't explain, sidney... it doesn't matter now...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{whose arms will i have to pry you out of next? not that i don't think you didn't invite it! i know that look of yours, that pose of being wronged and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a sidney falco }
<A>__{hunsecker's rising tide of brutality is having some effect on susan, and sidney, fearing for her, tries to intervene.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i was trying to build her up, not tear her down }
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(viciously)}
<D>__{is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!}
<P>__{(turning back to susan)}
<D>__{let's call it quits, my dear. i'd like it fine if you found another home. that means the front door is open! pack your things, rent a moving van and git!}
<P>__{(pacing the room)}
<D>__{and as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage! you're incompetent a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!}
<A>__{susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near hunsecker's feet. after a moment she turns and moves to the door of her bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside, closes the door in hunsecker's face.}
