<L>__{interior helen's office day}
<A>__{tracking with harry as he moves through the offices. he passes through a library like maze of records stacks. through them he can see helen at her desk. but as he approaches, still concealed, allison puts a call on hold and whips around to helen.}

<D>__{helen!}
<P>__{(grinning conspiratorially)}
<D>__{it's your mystery man.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{simon? ohmygod.}
<A>__{helen, normally the image of composure, goes suddenly fluttery and nervous as a high school girl. she takes the phone, turning away from allison.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{hello, simon?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's all right. there's no one around.}
<A>__{helen glimpses allison with her ears cocked and gives her a scowl and a shooing motion. allison turns away, grinning.}
