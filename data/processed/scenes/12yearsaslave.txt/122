<L>__{interior judge turner's plantation food storage night}
<A>__{solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed. dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is about. taking out a handkerchief, solomon begins to load it with food. not too much. not so much his thievery will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.}
<L>__{exterior turner plantation night}
<A>__{solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits. then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. it is celeste coming out of the night. she makes her way directly to solomon. with no greeting, she says:}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i am hungry.}
<A>__{solomon gives celeste the handkerchief he's filled. she opens it, and begins to devour the food. as she eats:}
<C>__{celeste }
<D>__{i was rude, and didn't even ask yo name.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{platt.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{was you free?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i was. i am.}
<A>__{solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he announces:}
<C>__{solomon }
<D>__{i remain free in my heart.}
<A>__{giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's heard:}
<C>__{celeste}
