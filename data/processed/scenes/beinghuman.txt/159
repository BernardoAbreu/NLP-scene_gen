<A>__{later, hector can't sleep. it has been too eventful a day. he sits bleary eyed watching a late night tv show. a man sits cross legged on a studio floor and is talking to a phone in viewer. the tv man has five small stones which he regularly scatters on the floor.}
<C>__{tv man }
<D>__{this is good, tony, the stones are talking to me already... now here's something... travel... movement... tony, are you planning a move... travel... anything?}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{yes i am... i've been thinking about a move to california...}
<C>__{tv man }
<D>__{the big one, eh, tony? these stones are really talking here... what are you planning for yourself in california?}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{i'm hoping for an acting career, mel...}
<C>__{tv man }
<D>__{tony, these stones really like what you're planning... there is no doubt in my mind about that... now listen... you have to be specific... these stones really want to tell you something, be it love, money or the purpose of your life... but i want a specific question from you... think about it... what do you want to know... love... or your income level next year? be as specific as you can, tony...}
