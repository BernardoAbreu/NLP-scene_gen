<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{a sixteen year old barris lies on his back on a couch lazily tossing a football in the air. tuvia, a thirteen year old girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. in the background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing of scales on a bass violin.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{when i was sixteen i had an experience with my little sister's friend tuvia that left an indelible impression.}
<C>__{barris }

<C>__{barris}
<D>__{of course you don't.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why are you waiting around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings?}
<C>__{tuvia}
<D>__{i don't know what anything you say means.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{no. you wouldn't, would you.}
<A>__{barris watches tuvia playing with the dog. she gets on all fours and yelps, imitating the dog. this excites the dog, who bounces around her. barris studies tuvia's exposed white underwear for a while. this excites barris. finally he pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over his pants. we hear him unzip his fly.}

<C>__{barris}
<D>__{honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop.}
<C>__{tuvia}
