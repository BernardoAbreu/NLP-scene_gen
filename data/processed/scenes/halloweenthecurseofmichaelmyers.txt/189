<L>__{interior tunnels}
<A>__{letting the rifle guide him, tommy makes his way through the tunnels. toward the sound of muffled chanting up ahead.}
<B>__{ceremonial room}
<A>__{the coven chants its invocation. wynn draws a magic circle around the infant with blood from a silver chalice. then he inscribes a pentagram in the air with an ornate dagger.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this ritual. bear our gifts to thorn. open us to the path of darkness. by these runes transform us. open our eyes and show us the chosen one to whom we offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.}
<A>__{suddenly danny is issued forth up to the altar. his eyes dark, lifeless pools. kara struggles against her bonds.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny!!!}
<A>__{loomis lurches forward. halted by massive, restraining hands.}
<B>__{catwalk}
<A>__{tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the evil ritual. startled by the sound of rusted chains. pulleys cranking. the shape's cell being opened.}
<B>__{ceremonial room}
<A>__{the shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward. strangely calm. hypnotized. looming above kara. she lets out a scream of unbridled terror as he raises a gleaming dagger. wynn stands behind danny. places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft. above the baby.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{strong and fierce thorn, thundered, by thy hammer we summon thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood. let thy darkness descend on your son. danny. lord of the dead.}
<A>__{danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the screaming infant. wynn speaks in the ominous whispering voice:}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{kill for him, danny ... kill for him.}
<A>__{kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of michael.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{michael, please. you can make him stop. you remember, don't you?}
<A>__{the shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask. listening. reminded of his mother.}
<C>__{kara}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{remember what he did to you that night. what his voice told you to do. you can stop it, michael. stop the voice forever.}
<A>__{danny's eyes flash like fire. the chanting is insidious.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{kill him, danny. kill him!}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny, don't listen! the voice isn't real!}
<A>__{danny turns sharply, seeing his mother. suddenly terrified.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{kill him, danny! you feel the rage inside! you are thorn!}
<A>__{suddenly danny drops the dagger. wynn flies at him, screaming like an enraged beast. the shape raises its dagger and plunges it into wynn! wynn's eyes go wide with shock. the shape lurches empathetically. wynn staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach. rapid fire gunshots rip through the chamber as tommy lets loose a barrage of bullets from above. taking out several coven members, the rest scattering, retreating into the tunnels. loomis dives danny a split second before he through kara's bonds with the dagger. kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by gunfire. the altar decimated. candles falling. setting the room ablaze. wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk. wooden girders crash down from the ceiling. tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle. the shape staggers, trying to get to its feet. slowly. painfully. flames lapping at its back. loomis crawls toward the rifle. grabs it. rises just as wynn seizes danny, a dagger at his throat. pulling him away.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{no!!!}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{stay away, sam.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{leave the boy. take me.}
<A>__{loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of wynn. surrendering himself. tommy drags himself toward kara and the baby. paralyzed with horror as they try to anticipate wynn's move.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(smiles trenchantly)}
<D>__{good bye, dr. loomis.}
<A>__{loomis turns. gasps in startled reflex. the shape rises up behind him, swiping the dagger across his chest! wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with danny.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{mommy!!!}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny!!!}
<A>__{tommy and kara race across the flame engulfed room, reaching the door just as it slams shut. cutting them off. the shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls loomis over the crushed altar. tommy sees loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when the shape turns on them! tommy stands in front of kara and the baby, backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels. the shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.}
<B>__{tunnels}
<A>__{tommy, kara and danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.}
<B>__{loomis}
<A>__{painfully crawls away.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{die, michael. in the name of god, die!}
<B>__{end of tunnel}
<A>__{tommy, kara and danny reach the tunnel end. kara pounds frantically on the elevator panel. a deafening roar the sound of fire as the shape sweeps toward them.}
<B>__{the shape}
<A>__{glides steadily through the tunnels. a walking pillar of flame. undaunted. unstoppable. hell spawned.}
<B>__{end of tunnel}
<A>__{finally the doors open. kara and tommy barrel inside. mashing buttons until the doors close a millisecond before the shape reaches them.}
