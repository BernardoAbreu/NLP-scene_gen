<L>__{interior party night}
<A>__{the party's winding down hip hop kids, lower east side types. jean and benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three clusters of people maybe fifteen in all... jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red haired dealer rockets (35). they greet each other as friends. rockets leads jean aside. they stand near a wall where a painting hangs ("flats fixed"). it bears jean's three point crown.}
<C>__{rockets}
<D>__{you did that, didn't you?}
<A>__{jean shrugs.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i gave it to maripol. she let me stay here for awhile.}
<A>__{jean hands him twenty dollars. rockets hands him two dime bags. as if thinking better, he hands the bill back to jean.}
<C>__{rockets}
<D>__{do one for me and it's free. how's that?}
<A>__{jean re pockets his money. he gestures to rockets as if to say "fine it's a deal." he and benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the window, as before. this time, it's good. they lean back into it, slumping down into the couch. nearby, rene sits on a couch with three street kids artists (who we've seen at milo's opening). they sit on their knees looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth. artist #1 looks through the window with a pair of binoculars. he points down towards the street, trying to get rene's attention.}
<D>__{artist #1 check this out, rene.}
<A>__{rene lunges towards the window. the stereo blares (curtis blow's "survival")}
<C>__{rene}
<P>__{(singing along)}
<D>__{"the name of the game is survival, you learn it in jail upon your arrival!"}
<A>__{another artist (#2) a young black man, runs up and tries to turn down the volume. rene grabs his crotch.}
<D>__{artist #2 chill, man! be cool! this isn't even my apartment!}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that? artist #2 cut it out, man! and don't be callin' me that shit!}
