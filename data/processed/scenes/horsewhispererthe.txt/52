<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hello, beautiful boy...}
<A>__{he lifts his head at the sound of her voice. grace, and the audience, see him for the first time his mad eyes, his terrible disfigurement... grace cries out, stepping backwards, nearly stumbling in the mud... what is left of her horse are gone. annie realizes what's happened and, together with robert, rush to her... they too see the monster pilgrim has become and are horrified. grace angrily pushes away from them and "runs" off. robert goes after her. annie is standing in the rain with liz her eyes unable to move away from the sight of pilgrim.}
