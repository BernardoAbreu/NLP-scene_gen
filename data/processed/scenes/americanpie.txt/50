<L>__{interior kevin's bedroom night}
<A>__{late. kevin sits on his bed, reading a book the bible. if all students studied the way kevin's studying this book, we'd have a nation of geniuses. he's scrutinizing it. turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher cave paintings.}
<L>__{interior east great falls high little auditorium day}
<A>__{the vocal jazz group is doing a song. oz is singing along, really making it look like he's into it. he closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm. as the song ends, oz continues just a moment more with his shtick a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the number. the thing is, it actually sounds really good. oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group especially the girls looking at him, somewhat awed. the choir teacher is a smartly dressed black woman.}
<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{no, it was good.}

<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{well then keep it coming.}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{alright, people, good work! keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.}

<D>__{yeah. right, uh huh.}
<P>__{(then, back into it)}
<D>__{i feel like i've discovered this whole new side of me. music is so expressive.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i mean, i agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?}
<A>__{oz "gets serious" at this.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{oh sure. i know what people think. it's like, oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player i also play football, by the way but that's like...not all that i am.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{of course, i didn't }
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(sparking to this)}
<D>__{you? you think i don't get that? god, it's like just because i don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "oh, here's this goody two shoes choir girl priss."}
<A>__{of course, this is what stifler said about her. and for a moment, this catches oz off guard.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{yeah...so like, what else do you do?}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{well the same things you do. hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.}
