<C>__{tony}
<D>__{uh kind of been wondering the same thing about you.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{you’re supposed to be locating the tesseract.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{we are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. when we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. what is phase two?}
<A>__{steve enters, and slams a large hydra gun on the table.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{phase two is shield used the cube to make weapons.}
<P>__{(to tony)}
<D>__{sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.}
<C>__{fury}

<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i’m sorry, nick.}
<A>__{tony turns the screen towards fury. it shows a plan for some a missile.}
<D>__{what were you lying?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i was wrong, director. the world hasn’t changed a bit.}
<A>__{thor and natasha enter. banner looks to her.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{did you know about this?}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{you wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i was in calcutta, i was pretty well removed.}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{loki’s manipulating you.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{and you’ve been doing what exactly?}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{you didn’t come here because i bat my eyelashes at you.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{yes, and i’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.}
<P>__{banner (cont’d)}
<D>__{i’d like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.}
<C>__{fury}
<P>__{(pointing at thor)}
<D>__{because of him.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. we learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly hilariously, out gunned.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{my people want nothing but peace with your planet.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{but you’re not the only people out there, are you? and, you’re not the only threat. the world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{like you controlled the cube!}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{your work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it, and his allies. it is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for}
<C>__{a higher form of war.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{a higher form?!}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{you forced our hand! we had to come up with some }
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{nuclear deterrent! ’cause that always calms everything right down.}
<A>__{everyone becomes hostile and begin cutting each other off.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{remind me again how you made your fortune, stark?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i’m sure if he still made weapons, stark would be neck deep }
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{wait wait! hold on! how is this now about me?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i’m sorry, isn’t everything?}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{i thought humans were more evolved than this.}
<A>__{everyone begins arguing over each other.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?}
<C>__{thor}
<P>__{(to thor)}
<D>__{tis your champion.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{you’re not my champion!}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{are you boys really that naive? s.h.i.e.l.d monitors potential threats.}

<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{you’re on that list? are you above or below angry bees?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i swear to god, stark, one more crack...}
<C>__{tony}
