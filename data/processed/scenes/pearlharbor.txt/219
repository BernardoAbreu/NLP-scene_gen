<D>__{you hear something?}
<A>__{something stirs in the ship; a noise...from where? then a point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting through the wall. and the sparks illuminate faces suddenly filled with hope. but as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the water, starts rushing out and the water starts rising again. the trapped sailors hope turns to terror.}
