<L>__{interior living room malahide's house day}
<A>__{close up on a strangely art deco electric fan heater, with bright red coils emitting waves of heat. we pull out to see malahide standing by the table with the flowers. there is now a half full glass of wine on the table, along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. a pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of malahide's jacket. julia enters the room and closes the door behind her. she is dressed in one of malahide's suits. it is a light weight suit of white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries. she crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre of the room, to allow malahide to look at her.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{malahide's nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to smile. he nods his head slowly a few times.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{yes... yes. you look...}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{surreal? strange? nightmarish?}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{no. you look...}
<A>__{he pauses, lost for words. julia doesn't wait for an answer. she crosses to the table and takes up his glass of wine. she downs it in one. malahide stares at her, a little surprised.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{yes, i still like wine ...}
<A>__{she smiles strangely at him and then moves closer. slowly, keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{... and more.}
<A>__{for a moment, malahide's face is stone. then, slowly, he returns her smile and, drawing his lighter, lights her cigarette.}
