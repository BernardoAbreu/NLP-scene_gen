<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i'm afraid i've only got a few minutes, but i'd love to.}
<A>__{there is a bit of confusion as all realize there is not enough room for another person at the table. smyslov offers floyd his chair and borrows another from a nearby table.}
<C>__{symyslov}
<D>__{what would you like to drink?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{oh, i really don't have time for a drink. if it's all right i will just sit for a minute and then i've got to be off.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{are you quite sure?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{yes, really, thank you very much.}

<D>__{oh, that's such a delightful age.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{how is gregor?}

<D>__{he's fine. but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.}
<A>__{polite laughter.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{well, where are all of you off to?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{actually, we're on our way back from the moon. we've just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at tchalinko. and what about you?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{well, as it happens, i'm on my way up to the moon}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{are you, by any chance, going up to your base at clavius?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{yes, as a matter of fact, i am.}
<A>__{the russians exchange significant glances.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{is there any particular reason why you ask?}
<C>__{smyslov}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{well, dr. floyd, i hope that you don't think i'm too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what's been going on up there.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i'm not sure i know what you mean.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{yes. well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{well, i suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{you mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{another thing, heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at clavius.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{how did they manage to do that without any communication?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{well, that does sound very odd.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{yes, and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s. convention.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{yes... well, i hope the crew got back safely.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{fortunately, they did.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{well, i'm glad about that.}
<A>__{the russians exchange more glances. one of the women offers around a pill box. elena and another russian take one and the third russian declines.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{dr. floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a pointerior you seem reticent to discuss, may i ask you a straightforward question?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{certainly.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius. something, apperently, of an unknown origin. is this, in fact, what has happened?}
<A>__{a long, awkward pause.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i'm sorry, dr. smyslov, but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this.}
<C>__{smyslov}
<D>__{this epidemic could easily spread to our base, dr. floyd. we should be given all the facts.}
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{dr. smyslov... i'm not permitted to discuss this.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{no, thank you... and i'm afraid now i really must be going.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{well, i hope that you and your wife can come to the i.a.c. conference in june.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{we're trying to get there. i hope we can.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{well, gregor and i will look forward to seeing you.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{thank you. it's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... dr. smyslov.}

<D>__{i wonder what really is going on up there? co pilot well, i've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. co pilot berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. co pilot i was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{i will bet it's a fortune. co pilot well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars.}

<D>__{we're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. is there anything we can do for you?}

<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{thank you.}

<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius. we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit – about twenty four hours. and then we're going to back empty.}

<D>__{well, i will tell you why i ask. you see, i've got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, i'm a little concerned about her.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i see. well, i'm sorry about that. i wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{yes, well, i wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except i've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, i've heard that ten people have died already.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i wish i could be more helpful, captain, but as i've said, i don't think there's any cause for alarm.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{well, fine. thanks very much, anyway, and i hope you don't mind me asking?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{no, of course, captain, i can understand your concern.}
