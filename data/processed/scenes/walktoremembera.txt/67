<A>__{landon gives a cheery little wave. he's very sweaty. his bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{hey. landon carter.}
<A>__{landon offers his hand. the reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: landon's army boots, torn jeans, dirty t shirt, aloof manner.}
<C>__{rev. sullivan}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you're in the play?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{lead man.}
<A>__{jamie slides out the door. she looks good in jeans and a white t shirt. almost normal. in the b.g., landon's bike crashes over. he bounds down the porch steps.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(explaining bike)}
<D>__{they took my license for 30 days. but nobody's pressing charges.}
<A>__{the reverend looks at jamie, concerned. landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush. not the best place.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i will get something for us to drink }
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{don't bother!}
<A>__{but she's already gone. the reverend gestures toward the open front door.}
