<A>__{two young thai boxers beat the crap out of each other. the crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which way the fight will turn. one of the thai boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands... the ring is cleared and liang jumps in as julian pushes his way though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. they know him here. again bets are placed.... pick out a face in the crowd. billy. julian's older brother (late thirties). julian sits down next to billy who's delighted to see him, throwing his arm around him, pulling him in close.}

<A>__{billy offers julian a hit from his bottle of mehkong whiskey. julian refuses. he's more interested in the fight. back to the ring where the fight has just started. liang is immediately on the ropes. julian watches, concerned. billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. he nods to julian and takes it outside. back to the fight where liang pulls an amazing move. turns the tables. takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists. as julian applauds liang's success, billy slinks off out of the auditorium. liang wins the fight with a knock out... the crowd go wild with adulation... julian watches, transfixed... liang is lit up by a beatific white light... as he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him... julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him... ... which is almost like a religious ceremony... the audience bow down before liang as he stares out into the light... a look of calm washing over his face... a sense of stillness and peace... enlightenment through victory and violence...}
