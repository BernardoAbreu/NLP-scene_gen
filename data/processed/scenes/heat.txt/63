<L>__{exterior alley wide on pavement day}
<A>__{we're looking at chalk outlines of the bodies of guard one and driver from the armored truck. the pavement is bloodstained. bright lights illuminate the crime scene.}
<C>__{hanna }
<D>__{where's the ambulance?}
<C>__{heinz }
<D>__{they dumped it four blocks from here...}
<A>__{widen to reveal hanna who we now identify as a police lieutenant of detectives. he's just arrived. the alley's been roped off with sawhorses labeled "crime area." the armored truck with the holed side is still there. one of hanna's crew, drucker, a black intelligence analyst and technician at 45, was already there. a uniformed sgt. heinz was there first and by procedure took command. it's his crime scene.}
<C>__{heinz}
<D>__{masks, guns, radios all left behind. no prints.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what about the crash, the white towtruck.}
<A>__{two more of hanna's crew arrive in an unmarked car and join him: casals bald at 30 and wiry; bosko a huge, oversized man.}
<C>__{heinz}
<D>__{hasn't turned up. got a witness: janitor next door.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i.d. anybody? plate? description?}
<C>__{heinz}
<D>__{shhaaapes ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{one big. one thin. he heard it...}
<A>__{guy's nearly blind.}
<C>__{hanna}
<P>__{(re: body outlines)}
<D>__{what about them?}
<C>__{drucker}
<D>__{according to the janitor, he...}
<P>__{(guard two outline)}
<D>__{started mouthing off to one of the gunmen.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{oh, that was smart.}
<C>__{drucker}
<D>__{i figure the other went for...}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{... that gun when the shooting started. one guy called a guard "slick."}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{"slick?"}
<C>__{drucker}
<D>__{yeah. and they ignored the loose cash.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{'cause they had no time, cause they knew our response time, cause they were on our air.}
<C>__{heinz}
<D>__{you recognize their m.o.?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yeah. their m.o. is that they are good. once it escalated into a murder one beef for all of them after they killed the first two, they popped guard number three 'cause it didn't rake any difference anymore, so why leave a living witness? drop of a hat? they'll rock and roll. also: the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl. so also start looking for recent highline burgularies that have 'mystified' us.}
<P>__{(to drucker)}
<D>__{run the "slick" bit to the fbi and see what it kicks out.}
<C>__{drucker}
<D>__{i called it in already.}
<C>__{hanna}
<P>__{(to casals)}
<D>__{split the fences. i will take cuzomano and torena. you take the east side. go through the tapes of who we been listening to.}
<P>__{(to drucker)}
<D>__{hang in with forensics on all physical evidence.}
<P>__{(to bosko)}
<D>__{how'd they know the route of the van and what it was carrying? does gage print the day's routes? what do they do with the printouts? who collects their trash? run makes on all their middlemanagement. did someone give this score up?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{check the three guards. see if one of them was a tipster.}
<C>__{bosko}
<D>__{what's the vibe: home grown or out of town?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{out of town. frankly, i hope they are scoring once and passing through. and i doubt it.}
<C>__{heinz}
<D>__{this going to stay in area?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{this look like boosters working the local seven eleven to you? it goes to major crime.}
<P>__{(to his crew)}
<D>__{go to work.}
<A>__{they move toward the forensic unit, scraping tire rubber and measuring distances as we}
