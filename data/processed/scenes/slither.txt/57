<L>__{interior grant garage day}
<A>__{it's too dark to see much in here, but we do see grant putting meat into a garbage bag.}
<L>__{exterior grant house day}
<A>__{grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes it.}
<L>__{exterior old barn evening}
<A>__{grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging the garbage bag. grant comes upon the old wooden barn.}
<L>__{interior old barn night}
<A>__{grant enters. it is almost completely dark. he hears}
<B>__{weeping. chains rattle.}
<A>__{grant peers over at brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting on the nest he has made. she's chained up and moans through a mouth gag. grant walks to her. her body is horribly pear shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous pregnancy. grant pulls her gag away.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{grant? grant, i'm hungry. i'm so fuckin' hungry i think i'm gonna die.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{brought you munchies.}
<A>__{grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead animals out in front of her.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{been saving for a rainy day.}
<A>__{closeup: brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. she stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed. she looks up at grant.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{grant, i'm sorry if i did something wrong! i think i gotta i think i should go to a hospital!}
<A>__{grant doesn't respond. brenda's eyes trail back down to the meat. brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot infested pork chop, pulling it toward her. we hear, but can barely see, brenda chowing down on the raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.}
