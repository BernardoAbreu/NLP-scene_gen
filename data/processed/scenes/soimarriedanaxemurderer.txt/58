<L>__{interior bart platform day}
<A>__{charlie is on the crowded platform. next to him is an old lady with a lot of shopping bags. three kids on skateboards whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. cat toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. charlie bends down and starts to help her gather her stuff.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{thank you very much, young man. i've gotta get all this stuff back to my children.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{your children?}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{when i say my children i mean my cats. you see my children moved out years ago, so all i've got is my cats. i have over one hundred of them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's a lot of cats.}
<C>__{harriet }
<D>__{charlie.}
<A>__{charlie looks up and sees harriet waving to him from the subway stairs. he waves back and motions. "i will be there in a second", and continues to help the old lady. she watches from the stairs.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{you see this red toy? that's for the captain, he's finicky. and this blue one? that's for marco polo.}
<A>__{two train headlights are seen off in the distance.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{do you have a name for all of your cats?}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<A>__{charlie glances over at harriet, who slowly makes her way down the platform towards him.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{let me see! there's winston churchill, reda sovine, thomas edison, andrew carnegie...}
<A>__{the train is getting closer and closer, and so is harriet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...he was scottish.}
<A>__{harriet moves forward a step, charlie moves back a step.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{wasn't he irish?}
<A>__{as harriet seems to get closer charlie continues to back up, picking up cat toys. charlie realizes he has no where else to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping his conversation with the lady.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{actually he was scottish. trust me, i know these things.}
<A>__{harriet is moving in on him. charlie steadily makes his way down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food down the platform. the old lady is unsure what is going on, she tries to keep up with him.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{now that you say it, he was scotch.}
<A>__{charlie runs out of platform. harriet is very close to him. the train is closer, so is harriet. charlie lets out a scream.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, harriet is a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. charlie is safe. people are all staring at charlie curiously, including harriet and the old lady. charlie is embarrassed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{nooooooo, scotch is a drink. scots are a people. sorry, that just always bugged me.}
<A>__{no one knows what is going on.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't know it meant so much to you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hi, harriet.}
