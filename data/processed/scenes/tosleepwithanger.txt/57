<L>__{exterior railroad tracks hot afternoon}
<A>__{harry and gideon are walking along a railroad track. the sun is blinding. the heat makes the asphalt appear to turn into a lake off in the distance. gideon appears exhausted; beads of sweat continually form on his forehead. he fans himself with his hat. harry is unaffected by the hot temperature.}

<D>__{i can sit here and look at train tracks all day. we laid enough of them, didn't we? so many memories are stretched along tracks like these.}
<A>__{gideon looks down the tracks. a bowl of dust stirs off in the distance. the hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid.}
