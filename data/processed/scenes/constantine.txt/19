<A>__{four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. the old woman follows, begs them to be gentle. they swing the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. she freaks.}
<L>__{interior apartment 7b}
<A>__{hennessey can only watch as john threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan. he climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes have closed and she's shaking badly. her body seems to be going into shock. isn't strong enough for this. john has no choice slaps her. eyes pop back open. dark and dilated. he yells down at her in aramaic and english.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar! rescind from the flesh i command thee }
<A>__{the girl chokes as if ready to spit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's it time to go home.}
<A>__{jeanie screams }
<C>__{jeanie}
<D>__{tiempo para morir!}
<A>__{her body suddenly pulses half again larger. john recoils for a beat. odd. he continues in aramaic }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar }
<A>__{another pulse and this time a shape is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through. john backs off watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. john glances to hennessey. what the hell? mirror arrives at the doorway, bangs against the jam. john waves them in. the four men heft it into the room.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lift it. over the bed. up.}
<A>__{john ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hennessey, tie it off }
<A>__{hennessey is glad to be called into service quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror. john straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now close your eyes all of you and whatever happens do not look into the mirror.}
<A>__{the men close their eyes. muscles tense under the weight.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar! rescind from the flesh i command thee!}
<A>__{jeanie reacts that shape reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion. john unblocks the mirror for a second and jeanie is reflected inside. it's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else. the surface of the mirror flexes in the hands of the men. one starts to look }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{jeanie screams breaks free of the straps. she rises up, grabs john tight around the throat. nails dig deep.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{john?!}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(looking into mirror)}
<D>__{not yet!}
<A>__{john struggles, puts his hands over her mouth cutting off her air supply. question is, who's going to pass out first? jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. she goes into shock, body collapsing shaking close to death.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look! look at me!}
<A>__{but she's passing out first. john quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{goddamit look!}
<A>__{ and presses it against her forehead. eyes snap wide and john unblocks the mirror. jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{smile pretty you vain prick.}
<A>__{the child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off demon. one that knows it just got suckered in. mirror vibrates wildly in the men's grip. demon reflection ripples the glass bending it outward into three d space as the girl takes her last breaths }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now, hennessey. now!}
<A>__{hennessey pulls the rope with all three hundred plus pounds as john gives the demon face a full extended}
<B>__{finger.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{for your boss.}
<A>__{demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion. swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{john jumps up and helps push the mirror free.}
