<L>__{interior an upstairs room of the carousel building night}
<A>__{this room has obviously been relegated to the status of the storage room. it contains the water heater, mops and brooms, old bed springs, etc. in the middle of the room a space has been cleared for a table, around which are seated hooker, gondorff, niles, singleton and twist. gondorff is in his t shirt, but still wears his hat. kid twist is in a suit as usual. the room is illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling.}

<P>__{(showing hooker photographs of three men)}
<D>__{these are combs' favorite torpedoes. riley and cole.}
<A>__{we recognize riley and cole as the two guys who got into mottola's cab.}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{they do most of the small jobs, but lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on you 'cause they're kinda messy. no class.}
<A>__{we go to hooker. he's real grateful. billie, wearing an evening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the empty beer mugs on the table.}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{we got reason to believe riley was the guy who hit luther. but if you see either one of these two, find yourself a crowd, or take 'em someplace you know you can handle 'em.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{but most of all let us know. if they got a hit on you, we gotta fold up the con. you're too exposed. you got that?}
<A>__{hooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you sure it'll be one of these two?}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{no. they're just the only ones we know of.}
<A>__{billie has finished gathering the mugs, and leaves the room with them. we follow her down the hall and into the:}
<B>__{receiving room of her brothel}
<A>__{carousel music filters up from the arcade below. the room has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken up by tables and couches. it's a comfortable place, but not opulent. some of the girls sit patiently on the couches, others play canasta at the tables. most of the men are at the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand. billie comes over to the bar.}
<C>__{billie}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{set me up five more beers, will ya danny.}
<A>__{as danny goes to fill the mugs, billie's eyes fix on a man at the end of the bar. we move to reveal snyder, intently scanning the room, as if he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush. not finding what he wants, he comes down the bar to billie.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{you the owner here?}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{that's right.}

<D>__{i'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. thought he mighta come in here.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{don't think so. i know everybody in the place and i always bounce the lamsters.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{all right if i look around your lobby?}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{no, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.}
<A>__{billie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass and pushes it over to snyder. he ignores the gesture.}
<C>__{snyder}
<P>__{(with controlled force)}
<D>__{i don't really need your permission.}
<A>__{we go to billie. she knew that when he came in.}
