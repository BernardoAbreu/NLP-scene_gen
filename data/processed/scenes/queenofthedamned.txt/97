<L>__{exterior griffith park observatory night}
<A>__{looking out over the observatory's ledge, jesse can't believe what's just happened. she laughs, intoxicated by the experience.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{do that again!}
<A>__{lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. her trust. for a moment she laughs like a child. then they look at each other deeply, feeling something. he wants to kiss her. she knows it. he turns away.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{and now for my next trick.}
<A>__{lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open. jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something stirring in her. magically, the wound heals up. she stares, impressed.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{did it hurt?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes. for just a moment. but as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy.}
<P>__{(gazes at her)}
<D>__{you see, we love our victims.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{love? i thought it was the blood.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{no, although the taste is so rich and sweet. love is the essence of the dark gift. the connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.}
<A>__{lestat again becomes aware of jesse's pulsing jugular, the white flesh of her neck. he reaches out, touches her neck, strokes it. jesse shivers under his touch, terrified, but wanting more. lestat brushes his lips against her hair, her neck. runs his hands down her arms. she closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{as you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. you feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. the taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful...}
<P>__{(pulls away sharply)}
<D>__{no 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience.}
<A>__{but jesse steps forward. lestat turns, stares at her. her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced. one button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens her blouse down to her navel. lestat stares as jesse removes a long, silver hairpin from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about her shoulders. her face remains aimed unwavering at lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast. with her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the point across her breast. she inhales through clenched teeth... then settles as we see: the long incision go from pink to red; then the blood, like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping down her chest. lestat staggers. breaking their stare, he accepts her gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself. lestat closes her eyes... he comes up to her face, brushing his lips against her cheek. she shivers...}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(groans)}
<D>__{your blood...}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{do you like it?}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(losing himself)}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{he comes down to her slender neck. stares at the soft, pulsing skin. he bares his fangs.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(whispering, overcome)}
<D>__{do it to me... please... with your blood i will know you...}
<B>__{close on lestat}
<A>__{he can't help himself. he moves to jesse's white neck... closer... closer...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i will know everything...}
<A>__{but suddenly her words catch him... his head flails as he tries to stop his natural impulse. lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside. jesse gazes at him, surprised. he looms over her, angry.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you want to know everything. you want to see what it's like. then come! i will show you.}
