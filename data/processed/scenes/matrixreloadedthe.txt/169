<L>__{interior burnt out cathedral (matrix) night}
<A>__{neo sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring ahead. hes in the belfry of an ancient, destroyed cathedral, among the pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap. from here, in downtown, we can see the modern, uptown section, with its gleaming skyscrapers. metacortex still stands, illuminated by searchlights. neo sits and broods. isolated, his world turned upside down and right side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank. again, he tries his cell phone. static. he collapses it and puts it. just as it leaves his mind, it rings. the face flips open. neo puts it to his ear without speaking.}
