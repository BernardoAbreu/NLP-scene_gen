<A>__{jeffrey follows a nurse to a hospital room.}
<C>__{nurse cindy}
<D>__{please wait outside while dr. gynde prepares him to see you.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{prepares him?}
<A>__{she peers into the room. jeffrey does too.}
<L>__{34. interior hospital room day}
<A>__{all he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical machinery. doctor gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to jeffrey.}
<C>__{dr. gynde}
<D>__{hello jeffrey.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{hello, doctor gynde. how is he?}
<C>__{dr. gynde}
<D>__{he's fighting hard. jeffrey. it's very important that your father doesn't try to move. he's been immobilized. it would be very painful for him. sit close. you do the talking and moving. he knows you're here. he became very emotional. i don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this.}
<A>__{nurse cindy goes to the bed. she begins to pull the curtains back revealing mr. beaumont.}
<C>__{nurse cindy}
<P>__{(smiling a big smile)}
<D>__{mr. beaumont! your son is here to visit you.}
<A>__{then we see mr. beaumont. he has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him. a stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still. nurse cindy picks up a tray and leaves.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(shocked but concealing it)}
<D>__{hi dad.}
<C>__{mr. beaumont}
<P>__{(speaking as plainly as possible,}
<A>__{but sounds like mumbling)}
<D>__{hey jeff.}
<A>__{jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but remembers his father cannot move. jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.}
<C>__{mr. beaumont}
<P>__{(lips moving but hardly any sound)}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{are you feeling okay?}
<C>__{mr. beaumont}
<P>__{(more mumbling)}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{tears well up in mr. beaumont's eyes. before jeffrey can stop him he reaches for jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words.}
<C>__{mr. beaumont}
<P>__{(more plainly but under strain)}
<D>__{good to see you, son.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(holding back tears)}
<D>__{it's good to see you, dad.}
<A>__{jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.}
