<L>__{exterior vanger estate day}
<A>__{vanger has ventured outside to show blomkvist around the estate. smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{the island is owned by my family. your closest neighbor is my brother harald, another nazi if you can believe. two in the family. he's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. he's a recluse.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{he was there that day?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{indeed he was.}
<A>__{vanger's look to blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect.' he indicates another house on the grounds }
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{that's his daughter cecilia's house. they don't speak.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{does anyone speak to anyone on this island?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{actually, isabella harriet's mother who lives there }
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{ she speaks to harald which is one of reasons i don't speak to her.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{cecilia's brother birger lives there.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{who doesn't he speak to?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{you, probably. not that you'd want him to. he can be as unpleasant as harald.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm quickly losing track who's who.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{oh, how you'll wish were it always so. soon you'll know us all only too well with my apologies.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{out there is my nephew martin's house; harriet's brother.}
<A>__{it's a modern house lots of glass out on the pointerior}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{who speaks to him?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{i speak to him. he runs the company now, as i think i told you.}
<A>__{they hear a distant rifle crack and echo. it startles blomkvist a bit, but not vanger.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{someone shooting their dinner. gunner probably. the caretaker.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i just met him.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{he was 19 when harriet disappeared.}
<A>__{old enough, blomkvist gathers, to be considered a suspect. vanger points off }
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{he lives over there.}
<A>__{shivering in the cold, blomkvist turns.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{and you live here.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{your house.}
<A>__{for a moment, vanger isn't sure what blomkvist means. then he is, and is pleased by it.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{yes, you're right. the man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.}
