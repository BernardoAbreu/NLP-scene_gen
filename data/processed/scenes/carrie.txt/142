<L>__{interior the cavalier afternoon}
<A>__{the local after school hangout. clusters of students milling in and around booths. pinball machines, a jukebox thumping "no where to run" by martha reeves and the vandellas. sue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as chris enters, says hello to some of her clique, and spots her.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hey, sue! just who i've been looking for!}
<A>__{sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile. chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her john f. kennedy school yearbook across the table an action which sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i wanted you to sign my yearbook. hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up?}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(busying herself with the yearbook)}
<D>__{still at practice}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{well, i guess you've heard i'm out of the prom. i bet that cocksucker morton loses his job, though. daddy's suing them. hey, billee! billee! come over and say hi to sue.}
<A>__{sue slides the yearbook back across the table to chris, who examines it:}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, is that it? just sue snell?}
<A>__{billy goons into frame next to chris, glomming his arm around her neck.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hey, suze.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think we're going anyway, right, billee?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sure thing, charlie.}
<A>__{chris playfully jabs him in the ribs.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you mean crash?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sure, why not? hey, listen, i've got a good one. "roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but carrie white eats shit."}
<A>__{billy, goon that he is, cracks up. sue finds it not at all funny, but doesn't know exactly what to do about what she's feeling.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{chris, i've got to go.}
<A>__{a new tune comes on the juke shirley and company whooping it up on "shame, shame, shame."}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(oblivious, her laughter turning to fury)}
<D>__{that goddamn carrie! if only the rest of you had walked out with me... jesus, sue, why didn't you?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i took the detention because i thought we i earned it. it was a shitty thing to have done. end of statement.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{bullshit! that goddamn snerd and her batshit mother saying we're all going to hell.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{what'd she ever do to you, chris? or to any of us? why do you hate her so much?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hey, hey... tell me if i'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{me.}
<P>__{(it comes out a pinched nerve)}
<D>__{me. but i stopped.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(dawning on her; getting it finally)}
<D>__{oh. oh, aren't you just it? oh, my, yes.}
<P>__{(imitating; prissy)}
<D>__{you stopped. hey, billee, she stopped.}
<A>__{sue is scared now she hears it coming. there's no question about it, though; the rumbles have already begun, and there's no stopping what's coming.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{god, i'm dumb sometimes. billee, hey, billee, do you want to know why suze here didn't walk out?}
<A>__{billy's over by the pinball machines with some of his goon squad. he boastfully struts around much to their obvious delight making the sound of a chicken in reply.}
