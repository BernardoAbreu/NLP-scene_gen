<C>__{emma}
<D>__{a long way down.}
<A>__{steed swivels. sees emma blocking his path. cool menace. steed steps away from the edge, emma circles him.}
<C>__{steed}

<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i could be convinced, if ... i knew who poisoned me in the maze. that kiss ...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{it wasn't me; you have my word.}
<A>__{steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i need proof.}
<A>__{emma thinks. looks at him. deadly serious. their eyes lock. she hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{it was longer. on the lips.}
<A>__{emma hesitates. then a kiss on the lips. longer. but not much. steed grabs her hand, pulls her back.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{much longer. approximately ... fifteen seconds.}
<A>__{emma harumphs, exasperated. moves closer to him.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{... ready?}

<C>__{emma}
<D>__{... four ... seven ... ni ...}
<A>__{then ... forgets. warmer, more relenting. edging towards passionate. they stay embracing for fifteen seconds ...}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(aroused)}
<D>__{mmm ... what are you doing?}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{keeping a stiff upper lip?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{is that all?}
<A>__{the kiss continues couple of seconds longer. before emma withdraws. with an effort, she regains her composure. a long silence.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{so i'm in the clear?}
<A>__{steed savors the kiss. no reply. his smile says it all.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{but you did suspect me.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{not for a moment.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you're playing games.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{aren't we all, mrs. peel?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i thought you played by the rules.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i thought you didn't.}

<D>__{i'm playing to win.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{winning isn't everything.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{please don't tell me it's how you play the game.}
<C>__{steed}

<A>__{steed motions down the stairs. it's close to the edge.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{no, after you.}
<C>__{steed}
<P>__{(back to square one)}
<D>__{you don't trust me?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{as far as you trust me.}
<A>__{emma motions. steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round nervously. emma reads his thoughts.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{when it happens, steed, you'll be the first to know ...}
<A>__{with this comforting thought, steed descends first.}
