<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior rural landscape day}
<A>__{the sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dewwet field. d'artagnan and the musketeers ride into frame, continuing their journey to calais. d'artagnan squints ahead, wincing with every bump. porthos grins.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{beautiful morning, eh, d'artagnan?}
<A>__{d'artagnan is terribly hung over from the night's carousing. he looks like he could puke at any moment. so that's exactly why porthos shouts to him and says...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{you know, d'artagnan, it's not a good idea to travel on an empty stomach. you really should have had a big portion of those sheep's brains...}
<A>__{d'artagnan covers his mouth. porthos laughs goodnaturedly.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my head feels like it's filled with the king's marching band. would you please stop whistling?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{whistling? i'm not whistling.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{well someone is.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{the barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i hear it too. it sounds like...}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(knows immediatley)}
<D>__{a connon ball.}
<A>__{athos is cut off by an ear piercing whistle as a cannon ball drops out of the sky and strikes the ground nearby, sending up a tremendous explosion.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i hate cannon balls.}
<A>__{another ball explodes into the ground in front of them. their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them out of their saddles. as the musketeers and d'artagnan struggle to control their horses, they look back and see an old castle atop a distant hill. a group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from some long forgotten war. the musketeers barely calm their horses, when another ball comes screaming their way, impacting a few feet away. as dirt rains upon them:}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(to d'artagnan)}
<D>__{how's your head now?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm beginning to wish the cardinal had chopped if off.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{stay with us, and you just might get your wish.}
<A>__{athos spurs his horse across the field, d'artagnan and the musketeers follow. but they discover crude battlements in their path. athos changes direction, sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. he changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after. they ride as fast their mounts will carry them. a crossroads up ahead. athos sizes up the situation, shouts command.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{split in half! d'artagnan rides with me!}
<A>__{d'artagnan nods, thrilled to go with athos.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{we'll see you in calais!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{or hell!}
<A>__{athos and d'artagnan take off in one direction, porthos and aramis in the other. the pursuing horsemen soon race into view, break in half to give chase.}
