<L>__{exterior van day}
<A>__{ray is reading the map while robbie looks out the window. they are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{because i don't want everybody to see we've got a working car. (going over the plan) we'll stay along the hudson until we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the hudson. then take the back roads across connecticut all the way to boston.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where is everybody?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't know. running, hiding, hiding in their basements.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{if we had any balls, we'd go back there and find one of those things and kill it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, well, why don't you just let me make the big decisions, okay?}
<A>__{ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry at robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{which would be when? never ray? never's about your speed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{okay, enough robbie!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(angrily) okay! enough with the ray}
<D>__{shit!! it's dad, sir, or if you want mr. ferrier. that sounds a little weird to me but you decide.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad?!?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yes, rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i have to go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over. ray grabs robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. he glares at rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which ray has a hold of) i gotta go!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{not so fast, not so fast, all right? now, there are two things we have to watch out for, and the second is people who might want our car.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{there's nobody around!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<A>__{robbie breaks free of ray's grasp on his sleeve. robbie and rachel both get out of the car. ray follows the both of them to supervise the whole event from the van.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(displeased) rachel! rachel, that's}
<D>__{good right there. (points to a spot}
<P>__{20' away)}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm not going in front of you guys!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{all right, then just go where i can see you!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{are you crazy?? don't look!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm not gonna look! just stay in sight!!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that's looking!!}
<A>__{rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. robbie has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under the road.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen. every time you don't listen to me, i'm telling your mother, okay? i'm making a list. (reinforcing) i'm making a list!}
<A>__{rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking for a half way decent spot. she sees the river and looks at it in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. more bodies start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down the river. rachel begins to hyperventilate again as ray comes up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs her.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i told you to stay where i could see you!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm sorry!}
<A>__{ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van. army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. robbie, who's only interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity to do so. robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{stop!! do you have room??? stop!!!}
<A>__{some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{wait, stop!!! let me on!!! let me on!!! give me a hand!!!}
<A>__{robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large puddles of water. robbie is not giving up hope that one may let him on.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{wait!!! stop!!! give me a hand!!! you have room!!!}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{watch it, kid! you're gonna get yourslelf run over!!!}
<A>__{ray sees robbie trying to get on with them. he has had enough of robbie and goes up to him to tell him....}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what!?!?! robbie, you want to go in that direction?}
<A>__{robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{there's nothing living in that direction, robbie!!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{what do you care?!?!? you never gave a shit before!!! you never gave a shit!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{okay, hard ass, what's your plan? you're in charge now, you tell me what we're doing!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{we catch up with these soldiers, we pick up whoever else isn't dead and we get back at them!!! we get back at them!! that's what we do!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, now let's try one that dosen't involve your ten year old sister joining the army! you have anything like that???}
<A>__{ray and robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each other as the tanks continue rolling by.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{why don't you just tell us the truth???}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you have anything like that!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you have no idea which way to go!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you have anything like that?!?!?!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you wanna come off all wise and shit!! you only chose boston because you hope mom is there and if she's there, you can dump us on her!!! you can dump us on her then you'll only have to care about yourself!!! witch is exactly the way you like it!!!}
<A>__{robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline keeps him fighting at ray. they both can be seen with the air from their nostrils flaring like a bull. rachel rushes in as an attempt to get robbie to realize what he's doing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie!!! where are you trying to go?!?! what are you trying to do?!?!}
<A>__{rachel begins to cry as robbie looks at her in sorrow.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{whoe's gonna take care of me if you go!!!}
<A>__{rachel's last line almost brings robbie to tears as he picks her up and starts walking over to the van. ray stands next to the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the divorce of their parents.}
