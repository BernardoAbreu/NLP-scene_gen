<A>__{the kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, dimly lit quality. the drip of a faucet reverberates from the far corner. the mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. their smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. slowly, they move down the row of kennels.}

<D>__{look, this is ridiculous...}
<A>__{suddenly, blood curdling screams pierce the air. chase drops the phone and rushes out of the office...}

<A>__{the toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. mom is burying their heads in her dress. chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. her horrified eyes flash by chase. in an instant, she and the toddlers are gone. chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with mounting trepidation... zowie's cage is empty. chase shifts his troubled gaze to the... drip drip drip... as a puddle of blood forms on the floor. chase raises his eyes... the kittens' kennel nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, dangling from the grid gate. dripping. chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{it's too gruesome even for a man of chase's background. fighting the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog... ...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor. and the pile of blood spattered shards laying on the tile.}
