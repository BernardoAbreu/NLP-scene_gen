<L>__{interior sam tannick's office night}
<A>__{the office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting the shadowy nature of it's owner. one wall is glass, looking down on the information room. sam tannick, grizzled nsa chief, looks down at the activity below.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{gibbons enters, stands by the desk.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{evening, sam.}
<A>__{sam remains in shadow.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{what do you have?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{not a whole helluva lot. his final transmission was mangled. about something or someone called "ahab". whatever it is, it cost him his life.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{he was the best there was. that makes three agents lost.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{they're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. it's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night. then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{we're gonna have to step in, sam. those cia boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. let me take care of it.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{how will you fix it?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{i will go in with a team. but first i'm going to need some intel. i will have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. one of their own.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{so you'll dredge the bottom again. you've done that before. the results were... uneven.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{you wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. i've had my people put together a talent pool. i downloaded it to your desktop.}
<A>__{gibbons snaps on the giant flatscreen on sam's desk. he starts cycling through photo after photo of tough looking men.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{the usual prospects. convicts, contract killers, murde...}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{the scum of the earth.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{but programmable. and expendable.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{i've seen enough. turn it off.}
<A>__{gibbons clicks off the screen.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{they're degenerates. there's not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{that's exactly why we need them.}
<A>__{sam sighs, stares out at the information room.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{get these "scum", mr. gibbons, bring them in. test them. train them. find your man.}
