<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it's okay, baby. just stay there.}
<A>__{abby jumps up, grabs a branch and starts to climb.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{almost there.}
<A>__{abby starts climbing higher, testing branches as she goes. finally she reaches the branch he's on.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{you're gonna be okay. come on.}
<A>__{abby grabs a branch overhead and scoots down the limb. she reaches out, picks up the cat and cradles him.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{it's okay. i've got you.}
<A>__{d'artagnan safely in hand, she looks around and notices she's just outside a window. she looks in and sees a handsome man in a steamy bathroom taking a shower. this is}
<B>__{colin anderson.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{oh, my.}
<A>__{abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away. but a moment later, she's looking back in the window, to see colin step out of the shower. abby takes a deep breath as he crosses to the mirror, giving her a look at his abs.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{oh, my, my...}
<A>__{abby leans closer to see colin start flossing, wearing only a towel.}

<C>__{abby }
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<A>__{d'artagnan leaps to another branch as abby falls. as she plummets, her foot gets caught between some branches, leaving her now hanging upside down.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{the front lights switch on and colin, still in a towel, races out of his condo. as he runs up to the tree }
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{just stay calm. you're gonna be fine.}
<A>__{the branch breaks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ahhh!!!}
<A>__{abby falls to the ground but colin catches her. but only for a moment. she drops out of his arms and onto the ground. as she goes, his towel goes with her. landing on her face.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{she pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye contact with the one eyed trouser snake staring back at her.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{hi, i'm abby.}
