<L>__{interior privy chamber day}
<A>__{his private room. his sanctuary. where he took her before. the room to which only mary seems to have had access..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{your majesty..}
<P>__{(falling into a deep curtsey}
<D>__{as henry closes the door}
<P>__{ensuring their privacy)}
<D>__{i understand my family has offended you. but having taken my brother today, i beg you to spare my sister.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh, mary...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i realise you must replace anne as queen.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but must she die, too?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{she has been tried and found guilty.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you could send her away.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{i am bound by the law.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you could send her to a nunnery. no one would know.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anne? to a nunnery?}
<A>__{henry almost manages a smile.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there is precedent, my lord. louis of france did it, too. when his wife could not conceive.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the french queen was a blameless woman. your sister a witch.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i understand anne has offended you. i ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{for your part in the matter..}
<A>__{mary treads delicately. realising the very suggestion is treason.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{..does not unduly colour your thinking. killing anne will not make it go away.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it would only make it worse.}
<A>__{enry stares at mary..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{how could i have made that mistake?}

<D>__{suddenly his eyes are full of regret. and sadness.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{choosing her over you? enry thinks. a long silence.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{o. i will reflect on the matter. mary falls on one knee. kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in gratitude. henry stares, watching her as she goes. exterior tower hill day a team of carpenters erect gallows and scaffolding. hammers knock nails. a sickening metronome of death. otack', `tack', `tack'. n the hill: a blood stained chopping block is put into place. interior anne's cell day the doors to anne's cell open. anne looks up. in the doorway is mary. mary stares at anne.. anne's appearance is shocking. she looks ten years older. haggard and lined by stress. anne puts on a brave face, stares back at mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh, anne.. the two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. tight. tears run onto each other's shoulders..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{how has it come to this?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ssshhhhh.}
