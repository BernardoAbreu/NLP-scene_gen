<L>__{exterior a bank, blue bay day}
<A>__{sam walks down the steps, gets into his jeep, and drives away. across the street the white taurus ray and gloria watch.}
<L>__{exterior yacht brokerage day}
<A>__{sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone. ray duquette steps into frame, turns into the brokerage. the door swings shut behind him.}
<L>__{interior swimming pool, blue bay school day}
<A>__{girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off. as the girls begin to walk toward the lockers, they encounter... ray duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on... kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping a botticelli vision.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{nice stroke.}
<A>__{kelly, startled, turns to find ray walking toward her across the deck. she snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is there some reason why you're here?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{curiosity, i guess.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{about what? how to improve your breast stroke?}
<A>__{ray gives her a cold smile.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{actually, i was curious about how you see things working out, for you, sam and suzie.}
<A>__{this appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you all gonna go down to the caribbean together?}
<A>__{kelly looks around the pool area. a number of girls are watching from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{the thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're out of your mind.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i've been a cop for a while, kelly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. and then there's the love angle. i mean do you and sam really want that little pill head around, now that you have the money?}
<A>__{kelly starts to walk away. ray cuts her off.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{am i right, did sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking suzie? that's murder, kelly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{police god get a life.}
<A>__{she moves around him and walks calmly away.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(loud enough to make himself heard)}
<D>__{you're good. but you don't think that little ditz suzie's gonna hold together, do you?}
<A>__{kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as ray's words echo over the pool.}
