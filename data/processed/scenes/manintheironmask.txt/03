<L>__{exterior establishing the island fortress prison day}
<A>__{on a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of france stands an island fortress, a prison, like an alcatraz of the mediterranean. just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding. as we superimpose:}
<D>__{twenty two years later}
<L>__{interior the fortress prison}
<A>__{with the camera as our moving pov, we survey the prison. it is a horrible place: dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness. up a long winding staircase our pov moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... it is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison. we pan the cell. and we see a man. a man in an iron mask. it is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way. we push in on his eyes... they are blue, childlike. a greasy jailer the prisoner's keeper puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty.}
