<A>__{the gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. he hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. in the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. a little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. the unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. he manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. his bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. out of the rocks scurry three jawas, no taller than artoo. they holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. they wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. they hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.}
