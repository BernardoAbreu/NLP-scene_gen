<A>__{ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the windows. bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. then his eyes rack focus to a nearby dune. a rottweiler sized jumping spider stands atop it. two large eyes surrounded by six smaller orbs. orange and black designs on its abdomen. wiry hair. dagger sized fangs. bret can't quite believe what he sees. ashley starts the truck. this snaps bret back to reality.}

<D>__{ashley, wait!}

<A>__{bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune. he runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open it.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{please! open the door! i'm sorry!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i can't believe my mom was right about you. do you know how embarrassing that is?}

<C>__{bret}
<D>__{open the door, baby! i love you! i want to marry you! have my children! please!}
<A>__{ashley flips him the bird and burns rubber. as the truck moves out of the way, bret finds himself staring at several more jumping spiders that are methodically approaching. bret sprints around to the other side of the truck stop.}
