<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{ext andalusian villa (eve)}
<A>__{bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, exits her car and enters the villa. a flash of skirt and lace (int exterior villa flamenco dancers eve) where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets. the dancers perform on a raised platform and nyah nordoff hall's face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them. reverse angle ethan looking back in a similar way to nyah; surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party. nyah continues to look at ethan over the shoulder over her wanna be escort, a very attentive gentleman. nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving nyah and ethan looking at one another. ethan approaches her.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{do you know me?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{no. should i?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no. you just looked as if you did.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{no. just as if i'd like to.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh. well. i think that can be arranged.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{not tonight. bad timing. sorry }
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{there's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.}
<A>__{this stops her. nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose to nose. whispered but breezy:}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{look, it's either you or the rent and i don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what if i pay the rent?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{uh huh?}
<A>__{glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink then:}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet i will pay your rent.}
<P>__{(kissing him, sweetly)}
<D>__{now bugger off.}
<A>__{and purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of the dancer's steps to cover her own. once upstairs, a security guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to ethan. in a few moments, nyah can be seen past the windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following. in another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of nyah. ethan smiles, moves out of shot.}
