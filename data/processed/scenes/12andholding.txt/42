<D>__{you have to eat something. it may not be gourmet, but you don't look that finicky.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{this stuff feels like shit in my mouth.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{it's macaroni and cheese.}
<C>__{leonard}

<A>__{the nurse grabs the tray of food. she removes an untouched apple and places it in leonard's hand.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{i don't like apples.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{so, you can't taste it, right? maybe you'll like the crunch.}
<A>__{the nurse exits. leonard eyes the apple in his hand. a beat. he reluctantly takes a bite. the apple makes a loud crunch. leonard starts chewing. after a few seconds, a smile comes to his face. he likes it.}
