<D>__{four. two on top and two on bottom. he got a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar. nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing the cradle will rock and he'll sleep the whole night through. kris' favorite subject is math. he loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies. he knows how to ride a bike. why? because i taught him. phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall. nicky just likes to flintstone his tricycle. phillip's favorite cartoon is tunenami.}
