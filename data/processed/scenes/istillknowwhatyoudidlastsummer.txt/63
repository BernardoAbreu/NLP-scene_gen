<P>__{(to tyrell)}
<D>__{song number thirty nine.}
<A>__{tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell. she looks at the monitor, then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing no, belt gloria gaynor's "i will survive."}
<C>__{julie }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{first i was afraid...i was petrified...}
<P>__{(continues singing under)}
<A>__{will stands, clapping. tyrell pounds his chest. karla flips up her lighter, swaying like a hard core fan. and julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.}
<C>__{julie }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i will survive...i will survive...}
<B>__{angle on the karaoke monitor}

<C>__{julie }
<P>__{(singing then trailing off)}
<D>__{and i still know...what you did... last summer...}
<A>__{her voice trails. her smile abruptly fades.}
