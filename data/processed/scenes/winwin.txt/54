<D>__{time. switch. and...wrestle!}
<A>__{mike blows his whistle again and kyle goes on the offensive. he gives carlos a quick head fake and before carlos knows what's happened, kyle has grabbed his ankle and tripped him down to the mat. carlos looks shocked. kyle pops back up but stays focused on carlos. mike looks to vigman who raises an eyebrow, impressed. one thing is certain, kyle can wrestle.}
