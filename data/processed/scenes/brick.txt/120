<L>__{exterior runoff tunnel day}
<A>__{brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet. gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are tugger, the pin, five of tugger's flunkies and dode in the middle. everyone looks at brendan. a long silence. brendan clears his throat.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{what'd i miss?}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{dode here says emily kostich is dead.}
<A>__{nobody reacts to that. brendan's face is placid.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{yeah. he says he knows who did it. he says he knows where the body's at.}
<P>__{(beat of silence)}
<D>__{and he says he wants more money than i think the information's worth.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that so, dode?}
<P>__{(to the pin)}
<D>__{so walk. what's the info have to do with you anyways?}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{plenty.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{plenty, he says.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{uh huh. and he wants cash on the nail. he's a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood. why pay for dirt you can't believe?}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{you'll believe this.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{maybe you will.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{you'll believe it, cause it's someone close to you. real close.}
<A>__{the pin looks up at brendan, whose face is loose and nonchalant.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe it's hot, but it's dode, you can't trust it.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{real close.}
<A>__{tugger's eyes are locked on dode, his scar the color of raw liver. brendan laughs and turns away.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'm getting my shoes wet for this. let him milk you if you want.}
<C>__{pin}
<P>__{(to brendan)}
<D>__{stay.}
<P>__{(to dode)}
<D>__{it's still too much.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{no it's not. you won't complain when you hear it.}
<A>__{tugger twists a stick in his hands. brendan watches him, curious.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{so maybe you should.}
<C>__{dode}
<D>__{you had her against the wall with the brick }
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{i know my business. it's still too much.}
<C>__{dode}
<P>__{(with growing confidence)}
<D>__{it's not, cause that's not why she was killed, and it's real important to you, cause the person who killed her's real close, and cause he's got a lot to lose, and he knows if i don't bury him by spilling to you i spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and he's really really scared she had a kid in her and he couldn't stand }
<A>__{tugger springs like a cat. he grabs dode's hair and knees his face. brendan stumbles towards them.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tug, it's alright!}
<A>__{tug has dode on the ground, kicking his stomach and chest.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{tug, stop.}
<A>__{tug backs off. dode raises his head. tug pulls the gun from his jacket. brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water. tug levels the gun at dode's head and fires one shot. the back of dode's skull comes off. the rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind them, and birds fly out. dode remains upright for a moment, then falls limp into the water. the pin's face is stupid, lifeless. tug turns to him, gun in hand.}
<C>__{pin }
<P>__{(thickly)}
<D>__{tug...}
<A>__{tugger fires dirt kicks up, and the pin scrambles back. brendan crawls towards tug, yelling for him to stop. tug fires twice more, both misses, and the pin is away. distant sirens. brendan's vision blurs. he stumbles and falls into the shallow water.}
