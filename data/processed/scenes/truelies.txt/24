<A>__{harry sprints across the snow covered lawn, through the trees. guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing. the snow explodes around him with bullet hits. two dobermans pelt toward harry, leaping at him in perfect unison. he waits... and knocks their heads together in mid leap with a crack like a baseball bat. the dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk. as harry sprints on, another doberman lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat. harry grabs the dog and shot puts him up into a tree without breaking stride. dog fu. the dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement.}
