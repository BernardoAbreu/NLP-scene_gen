<A>__{zedeck reaches the emergency pressure door. through the porthole he sees the hostages getting away. he tries the door hatch. locked. zedeck looks around. crosses to the lower rear galley. he kicks open the panel on the stove. rips out the propane tank. he runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock. he backs off 50 feet, turns and opens fire on the tank. the tank explodes, blowing the door out.}
<B>__{emergency parachute launch platform}
<A>__{the pressure door blows open and an explosion of pressurized air blasts through the platform. the remaining parachutists are blown out the rear. chutes deploying. marshall and serge are knocked down the ramp, tumbling toward oblivion. just as marshall's about to slide off the corner of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut. plummeting death. his grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long serge tumbles by marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly. shepherd and caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as the wind whips around them. the two other air force crew members without chutes also manage to hang on. as the plane depressurizes, it bucks like a wild bronco. marshall looks down into the sky. below his dangling legs, parachutes blossoij. he's straining... he can't hold on forever.}
