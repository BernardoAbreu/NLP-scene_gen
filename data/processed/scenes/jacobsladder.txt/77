<L>__{interior corridors night}
<A>__{jacob begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of corridors. the wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity. the smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. the orderly's feet plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way. the surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. body parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves faster.}

<D>__{where are you taking me? where am i?}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{you know where you are.}
<A>__{jacob, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. he glances to the side and sees mournful creatures being led into dark rooms. no one fights or struggles. we hear muffled screams from behind closed doors. occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from metal cages. dark eyes peer out in horror. in one room a baseboard heater bursts into flame. no one seems concerned. a door opens. a bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and mangled. one of its wheels is still spinning. jacob cries out but it is not his voice we hear. rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. his whole body stiffens. as he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before. jacob screams.}
