<L>__{exterior riverside day}
<A>__{a wide road runs alongside the tyne. it passes below the vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. a carpark lies at the foot of the 'iron bridge'. carter pulls up and parks. he gets out and moves quickly.}
<L>__{exterior the iron bridge day}
<A>__{the bridge is a, massive structure. the traffic lanes are flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. it is here that carter and margaret have arranged to meet.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{how were things between you and frank?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he was all right to me.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{nothing more? just another feller?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{nicer than most.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{but he was just another feller, wasn't he?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{though nicer than most?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{yes. i can't help the way i am.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(ignoring the statement)}
<D>__{why'd you see him so regular?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{once a week?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i call that regular.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he was gentlemanly. i like that.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{once a week you like a gentleman?}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{look, i'm me, right. you're not. we are what we are, like it or not.}
<P>__{(she turns and walks}
<D>__{slowly along the}
<P>__{bridge.)}
<D>__{why all the bloody needle?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{what was bugging frank?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it wouldn't work. dave would have killed us both!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i had to tell frank i couldn't see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday.}
<P>__{(she stops and looks over the bridge.)}
<D>__{he said he'd kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a moment. carter shakes his head. he gently takes the sunglasses from margaret's face and folds them up.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i don't believe you, margaret. frank wasn't like that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm the villain in the family, remember?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<A>__{carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it is. honestly.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{you bloody whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i don't know nothing.}
<A>__{carter holds her arm. she winces like she's been hit before.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{listen, the only reason i came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. and i won't leave until i do. you understand?}
<A>__{behind carter peter's jaguar comes slowly along the bridge. it stops. the passenger side is a gaping hole.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{hello, jack.}
<A>__{carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back to margaret.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you bitch! it was you who told them i was here, wasn't it?}
<A>__{he smacks her hard across the face. margaret cries out. the car draws alongside. a steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. con leans out, his usual cheery self.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{peter's very upset about his car. he's going to shit all over you.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i will catch up with you later, margaret.}
<A>__{and with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof. con jumps out of the jaguar.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(shouts above the revs)}
<D>__{come on, get in.}
<A>__{con does and they race off.}
