<L>__{interior torture room #1 day}
<A>__{sheryl hears mike's screams, but she's in a predicament of her own. sheryl's tied to chair. her hand is secured to table top. she can't move it. fingers separated.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what are they doing to him?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you should concern yourself with what's about to happen to you.}
<A>__{ida opens a sewing box, but instead of needles and yarn, she removes a cleaver. sheryl looks at the cleaver, then... to her hand... the pinky finger separated and immobile.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what are you doing, ida?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you think you're so much smarter than me, don't you?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{yes you do. admit it'cause i can see it in your eyes, darling. with your fancy schools and job and such.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{you think you are better than me.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<A>__{yes she does.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{might surprise you, but i was quite the student back in the day. straight a's. every subject'cept for science. infuriated me how they tried to explain away the lord's creations. our teacher, mr. billings, once said... in the future, humans won't be born with a pinky finger'cause of evolution.}
<P>__{(frustration building)}
<D>__{of all the... i shouted, "no! we are created in the lord's image... not some nonsensical theory by darwind."}
<A>__{sheryl stares at ida, terrified would be an understatement.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i suppose mr. billings and mr. darwind can stand up and cheer, because you, little lady... you're about to evolve.}
