<D>__{which one? 101 robots one of us.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{that is not a satisfactory answer! 101 robots one of us.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{that's helpful.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i could always interview each one individually and cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{how long would that take?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{about three weeks.}
<A>__{they share a look. clearly not an option. then. calvin. gets an idea. turns to spooner...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{or...}
<A>__{...and grabs his gun from his holster. he jumps back.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{we have one hundred robots here that cannot allow a human being to come to harm...}
<A>__{their eyes lock. spooner, getting what she's doing.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and one that can.}
<A>__{she raises the gun to spooner's head. hand, unsteady.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{am i holding this right?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{more or less.}
<A>__{calvin. swallows. looks over at the robots. then cocks the gun... and the robots come thundering towards them. like a row of linebackers. arms straight out. their footsteps deafening. coming closer and closer... when calvin. lowers the gun. the robots. all stop in unison. immediately returning to their resting positions. spooner and calvin stare out. every one of the robots moved. standing right in front of them, like metal statues. spooner. has had enough. takes the gun back from calvin...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{enough game playing.}
<A>__{...and bam! blows the head off of the nearest robot. its body crumples to the ground.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{guess that wasn't it.}
<A>__{calvin. cannot believe what he just did. rushes over to the destroyed robot.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.}

<D>__{are you crazy? those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines!}
<A>__{spooner randomly stops at another robot. raises his gun.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you hear that? you're worth more than i will make in my entire life...}
<A>__{his finger tightening on the trigger when calvin suddenly grabs his arm.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you can't just destroy them!}
<A>__{spooner. looking down at her. when suddenly something catches his eye. a movement. down the line. almost. imperceptible. he jerks his head. locking eyes with a robot. a couple feet away. it's him!}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<A>__{the robot suspect leaps forward. grabbing onto the railing of an overhead catwalk. his movements almost balletic as he swings himself up... spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the robot launches himself through the control booth window with a terrific crash...}
