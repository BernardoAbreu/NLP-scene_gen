<A>__{we are looking at the words 'little bastard' written in black script on silver metal, enamel on unpainted aluminum. we pull back to reveal the entire metal object, which is a 1955 porsche 550 spyder race car. it is small and curvaceous, and is being fussed over by several men in overalls. the number '130' is painted on its hood and doors. the porsche sits on a country road, two lane blacktop, heavily wooded, lit by a series of movie lights. on the hills lining the road a few rough wooden stands have been erected. a blond man vaughan stands near the rear of the porsche, a microphone in his hand. his voice floats eerily out of the woods from speakers mounted on a series of pine trees.}

'don't worry, that guy's gotta see us.' the year, 1955; the day, september thirtieth; the time: now.}
