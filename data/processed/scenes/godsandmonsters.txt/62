<A>__{clay knocks on the bottom of the dutch door as he lifts the latch and walks in. he is wearing a fresh madras shirt.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{the master is dressing. i am to offer you a drink. there is whiskey and there is iced tea.}

<D>__{no. you are a guest now. you go in the living room.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's okay, hanna. i'm more comfortable in here. it is hanna, isn't it?}
<A>__{she eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea. clay notices a bible on the counter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how long you worked for mr. whale?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{long enough. fifteen years.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? movie stars?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. we live simply, mr. jimmy and i. people come to play bridge. and now and then, young men to swim. you have people, boone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean family? all in joplin, missouri.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{your wife?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not married.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. because no girl in her right mind will have me?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{a man who is not married has nothing. he is a man of trouble. you need a woman.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you proposing what i think you're proposing? don't you think i'm a little young for you?}
<A>__{hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that clay bursts out laughing. she realizes that she is being teased.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{men. always pulling legs. everything is comedy.}
<P>__{(mimics an english accent)}
<D>__{"how very amusing. how marvelously droll."}
<A>__{hanna stares at clay until his smile fades. she resumes her chopping in silence.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you ever been married, hanna?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{of course. i am married still.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah? what's your husband do?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{he is dead now, twenty years.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{then you're as single as i am.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. i have children, grandchildren too. i visit when i can. but now that mr. jimmy cannot be left very long, i do not get away much.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{poor mr. jimmy. there is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. very sad.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're sure of that?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{this is what the priests tell me. his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sins of the flesh? everybody has those.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. his is the worse.}
<P>__{(worse)}
<D>__{the unspeakable. the deed no man can name without shame?}
<A>__{she loses patience with clay's blank look.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what is the good english? all i know is bugger. he is a bugger. men who bugger each other.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{a homo?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes! you know?}
<A>__{clay slowly sits up.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{that is why he must go to hell. i do not think it fair. but god's law is not for us to judge.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're telling me mr. whale is a homo.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you did not know?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{well...no, not really }
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you and he are not doing things?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{good. that is what i hope. i did not think you a bugger too. i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt anyone.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes. i trust you.}
<A>__{off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you must go in. quickly. he will not like to think i have had you in the kitchen.}
<A>__{clay gets up slowly, reluctant to leave the room.}
