<L>__{interior mark's mansion den evening}
<A>__{a disheveled mark, unshaven and sloppy looking, sits in a reclining chair, wearing boxers and a bathrobe, drinking a beer. beer cans are littered everywhere. a young gay man in a suit stands before him with a pad and a pen writing down everything mark says.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so then the flying duck flew all the way to alaska where it met up with a polar bear who could talk. and the polar bear's name was martin. and the polar bear was wearing a green cape. and martin and the flying duck both had race cars with their names printed on the side and...}
<A>__{jennifer enters the room, upset.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i just saw three people climbing the fence into your backyard. you really need to think about getting better security.}
<P>__{(noticing beer cans everywhere)}
<D>__{mark, how many of those have you had?}
<A>__{jennifer grabs the beer out of mark's hand.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(continuing; glaring at jennifer)}
<D>__{but then the evil goblin witch came in and stole the flying duck's race car and made the flying duck very angry.}
<P>__{(grabbing at his beer)}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{luckily the polar bear was there to snatch the race car back...}
<P>__{(but he misses)}
<D>__{unfortunately, the witch was a smart witch and the polar bear was powerless.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{is that the end?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{that's a strange ending.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey, don't look at me: it's the man in the sky's story.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{you want me to take this over to lecture films?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah. tell them to shoot that one this week.}
<A>__{the assistant walks away.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{tell them it's for kids!}
<A>__{jennifer glares at mark, disappointed.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you haven't left the house in weeks. every time i come by you're just sitting here writing down stories you get from the man in the sky.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey, he's the boss.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't you think you should go outside sometime? you know there's about five thousand people on our lawn waiting to ask you questions.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, yeah.}
<A>__{jennifer sits down next to him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what's with you? you seem sad.}
<A>__{mark shrugs.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't get it. you're a very successful writer, you've won countless awards and oscars...}
<A>__{jennifer waves towards a shelf full of oscars and various other awards.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you've changed the way people see the world, the way they see death and life. you've made the entire world happy.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not the entire world.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know. not you. the one person who should be happy, the person who has everything...}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{not everything.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what else do you want?}
<A>__{mark sits up in his chair and looks right at jennifer.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd trade it all in for you. all of it.}
<A>__{jennifer sighs and sits down beside him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, you've got me. as a friend.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(not sarcastic)}
<D>__{yeah. that's important.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{but why can't we be together. why can't you be with me?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{because of the whole snub nosed thing. with kids, your genetics. you know, fat, short...}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(stopping her)}
<D>__{yeah. okay. yup.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's almost a shame that being rich and powerful and famous doesn't change your genetics.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it would be great if it changed your genetic material because i really love you but i just don't...}
<A>__{suddenly mark has an idea. he looks right at jennifer.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it does change your genetics.}
<A>__{jennifer lights up.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{does it?}
<A>__{mark stares at her for a short beat. he can't go through with it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. no, it doesn't. our kids would be short and fat with little snub noses.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{right. too bad.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{anyway, i've come to tell you i can't go to the movies with you tonight.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i've got a date.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what? with who?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{rob marlowe.}
<A>__{mark stands up.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you've got to be fucking... rob marlowe?!? he's a complete and total asshole.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{not to me. he's very sweet and kind to me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well of course he is, look at you. i mean, for fuck's sake, a shark would be nice to you...}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it would?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well no, i mean...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{don't go out with him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{why not? he's a great match for me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's he got that i don't?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{we talked about this. if you and i got together it wouldn't be fair to our kids. they have the right to be attractive and have good genes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{if rob and i get married you can move into our mansion with us when we all die.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't want to move into your fucking mansion. and what are you doing thinking about marriage with him already? you haven't even gone on one date.}
<A>__{mark sits down.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's like nothing's changed.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{a lot of things have changed. i wish you could be happy.}
<A>__{there's a knock at the front door.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{that's him. gotta go.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{he's picking you up here?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it was his idea.}
<A>__{mark stands up, in shock and follows jennifer to the front door. she opens the door to find rob looking handsome and arrogant.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what's up? wow, i can't wait to have sex with you.}
<A>__{rob notices mark in his boxers and a bathrobe.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh hey there, mark. you look like trash.}
<P>__{(to jennifer)}
<D>__{come on jennifer, let's go have some fun. and then have some sex.}
<A>__{jennifer turns back to mark, sad that he's upset.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i will call you tomorrow.}
<A>__{the door closes and mark is left standing there alone. greg, dressed in a bathrobe and looking even more slovenly than mark, waddles up behind him.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{who was that?}
