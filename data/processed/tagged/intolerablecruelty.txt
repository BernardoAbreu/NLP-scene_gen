<C>__{first draft}

<A>__{beverly hills street night it is late night, and deserted. engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing. it is a mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano whooshes by with it. we hold as another car approaches. this one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing.}
<B>__{inside the convertible}
<A>__{the middle aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie. he is flushed, a rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead, and he merrily sings "casey jones" along with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.}

<A>__{the convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing.}

<B>__{beach}
<A>__{we are at the malibu guest quarters motel. the singing, squealing mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt. the young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half empty bottle of champagne. the man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{number seven.}
<A>__{she trots away. the man twists his rear view mirror to look at himself. he straightens his bow tie. he puffs his bounding forelock with one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins approvingly, and cocks a pistol finger at his own reflection.}

<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{rex. get away from the door.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{look, marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{we are. and it's winding down.}

<A>__{miles addresses a group of young attorneys at the firm.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. that's the problem with the institution of marriage it's based on compromise. even through its dissolution. one attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. the process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." some say, "life is compromise." but at massey myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.}
<A>__{the receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.}
<C>__{receptionist}

<D>__{now rex.}
<A>__{he leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ tell me your troubles.}
<A>__{rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{jeez. where do i start?}

<C>__{rex}
<D>__{...well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's her job. you have to respect that.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{when i first met marylin well, we were crazy about each other. not emotionally, of course. we just couldn't keep our hands off each other.}

<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{you know what i mean when i say "it."}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{gotcha. no need to get anatomically correct with me, rex.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{seems like there's more of it than ever before }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife. has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock out, sexy woman" you described?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i don't know. i can assume...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not in court you can't. has she retained counsel?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{video.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mmm... and to cut to the chase, forensically speaking is there a pre nup?}
<A>__{rex hangs his head. miles sighs sympathetically.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? what are, for you, the parameters of the possible?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{that's the problem. i can't afford to give her anything.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i know that sounds rough but i'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini malls, and i'm mortgaged up to my ass. if this deal goes south, i'm ruined i will lose millions.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{well is that possible?}
<A>__{miles smiles at him.}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well marylin and rex broke up and...}

<D>__{honey, i don't think this is really relevant to...}
<C>__{doyle}

<C>__{miles}

<A>__{miles flashes marylin a "you are kidding" look, but she assiduously avoids eye contact.}

<A>__{miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{as you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned. i was slandered in court.}

<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{that is true, isn't it miles? your pre nup is the best there is?}
<C>__{miles}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i just want to make sure that you both }
<A>__{he eyes marylin.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ understand what you're asking for here. the massey pre nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. no one can profit from the marriage. the pre nup protects the wealthier party.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well at the moment, that'd be me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and without it, that party is exposed a sitting duck. no wriggle room.}

<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i don't see how we can ever find our way back from...}
<A>__{miles, with his eyes still on marylin, reaches into his suit coat. he withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you know... there's nothing in the massey pre nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed.}
<A>__{he decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name. he pushes the paper across the table toward marylin. gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper. there is a long silence. we hear only the hum of ventilation, and wrigley's quiet snuffling. ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses over marylin's shoulder at the sheet of paper. marylin however, looks only at miles.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{it's the massey pre nup }
<A>__{marylin rips the paper in half.}
<C>__{ruth}

<D>__{no one will ever love me that way.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{not if you're lucky. no.}
<A>__{miles rises slowly to his feet. he puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward. marylin rises slowly to her feet. she leans forward. they kiss.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let's go home.}
<L>__{exterior massey house day}
<A>__{we hear a smashing breaking. gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing but quickly prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one end of the yard to the other.}
<B>__{track through house to}
<L>__{interior massey bedroom}
<A>__{the smashing is becoming louder.}
<B>__{an axe}
<A>__{breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the master suite.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{wait. just wait for one minute. sweet jesus, are you crazy?}
<B>__{construction worker looks up}
<A>__{he's the one wielding the axe. his co worker casts a look in our direction.}
<B>__{miles}
<A>__{reaches under the rubble and removes one box of cohiba especials.}
<C>__{construction worker}

<D>__{what if something happened to you? what would i tell little gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"}
<A>__{miles looks at the box, then at his wife. he tosses the box to the concerned construction worker.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{here, buddy. these are for you.}
<A>__{the construction worker gives him a very hostile look.}
<C>__{construction worker}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{great. now i can die.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well. you'd say "they devoted a whole semester at harvard to your dad. but your mom was the one that ever only nailed his ass."}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{sweet.}
<C>__{miles}
