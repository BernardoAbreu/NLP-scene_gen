<L>__{interior exterior first security bank later}
<A>__{ten minutes later the bank "crime scene" is in full swing. uniform cops are everywhere, trying to get statements from sobbing witnesses. harp, munoz, cole and pappas represent the fbi contingent. cole has one arm strapped to his body in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly. harp is barking orders to everyone in sight. outside (visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of rubberneckers. a minicam crew shows up. harp starts shouting at them. cole, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of handcuff's on utah's wrists with his good hand. johnny has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling into his eyes, but he seems not to notice. not to hear munoz speaking monotonously }
<C>__{munoz}
<D>__{ if you so desire, an attorney will be provided for you free of cost. do you understand these rights i have explained to you? utah?}
<A>__{pappas charges through the crowd, pushing munoz aside.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{he knows his goddamn rights!}
<P>__{(looks at utah)}
<D>__{jesus, kid. i knew you were getting too close to these guys.}
<P>__{(turns to the other agents)}
<D>__{gimme the goddamn key to these things, cole. christ!}
<A>__{he gestures to the cuffs still cutting into johnny's wrists. cole hands him the key. harp storms toward them.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{don't take those off. just leave them on! your partner's an accessory to murder. you realize that?}
<A>__{harp spins johnny by the shoulder to look at paramedics carrying the covered body of the off duty cop. beyond, still on the floor, is grommet, his eyes staring in death. he was right about not making thirty.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{three men dead. one of them a cop. how's that sit in your gut, utah?}
<C>__{utah}
<P>__{(cold and scary)}
<D>__{take your hand off my shoulder right now.}
<A>__{harp pulls back instinctively. utah's eyes burn into him. looks like johnny's not in the fbi anymore.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{look, harp. don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. let me ride him in.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{yeah, sure. why not? you two screw ups deserve each other. that's why i put you together in the first place. christ pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind }
<A>__{pappas steps close to the supervising agent.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{harp, let me tell you something. i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{what that?}
<A>__{angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his 280 pounds behind it. harp's head snaps back, and he flops in a heap.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{respect your elders.}
<P>__{(he takes utah by the arm)}
<D>__{let's go kid.}
<A>__{harp struggles to sit up, rubbing his jaw, as pappas stuffs utah into his car. harp is so shocked he doesn't say a word.}
