<L>__{exterior grounds near topaz ranch house day}
<A>__{tala, on his horse, as seen by arly. over the scene comes arly's voice calling from a distance.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{tala.}
<A>__{tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly different angle.}
<B>__{arly and clint}
<A>__{arly is looking o.s. toward tala. clint is now eyeing his sister up and down quite openly. she turns her head now and catches clint looking her over.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(after a stilted pause)}
<D>__{well }
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(with a perplexed smile)}
<D>__{what is this? }
<A>__{a gesture of his hand indicates the way arly has gotten herself up. that quick, arly's hand goes to the flower in her hair. and, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(bravely nonchalant)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{what do i mean? }
<A>__{before he can explain, tala pulls up in his horse and we hear his voice over the scene.}
<C>__{tala's voice}
<D>__{good morning, arliete.}
<A>__{arly, tala and clint tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{good morning, tala.}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{you have make yourself very pretty today.}
<A>__{arly is jolted by tala's innocent remark, and she can't help giving clint a little side glance in the way of reaction. clint has not missed tala's crack nor arly's glance, and when she gives it to him he says:}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{see what i mean?}
<A>__{he tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, going up the walk toward the house. arly turns to tala.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{have my horse saddled and sent around right away will you?}
<P>__{(then as a casual afterthought)}
<D>__{you can have that rocklin bring it.}
<A>__{she glances over her shoulder toward clint going up the walk. and then, looking back to tala, finds he hasn't moved, but remains smiling down at her.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{tala}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{rocklin is not here.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(breathlessly)}
<D>__{he quit?}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{he has gone to the line camp at table top.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{it was mr. harolday's orders.}
<A>__{arly looks away. her eyes stare blankly into space as she struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment. tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the girl's side.}
<C>__{tala}
<P>__{(in a fatherly manner)}
<D>__{why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him, little one. he is not for you.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{be quiet.}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{he has made the choice, arliete. with your own eyes you saw it yesterday.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{oh }
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{and she, too, has opened her heart to him already she has summoned him to her.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(this turns her around)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{dave of the white beard carries a letter to rocklin it is from her.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{i have just now met dave, and he tell me. so now he rides to table top.}
<A>__{arly is quiet a moment.}
<C>__{tala}
<D>__{little one you }
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(quickly, as she starts for the house)}
<D>__{oh, leave me alone.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{entrance to ranch. entering the driveway from the direction of santa inez, comes harolday, still looking the distinguished citizen. harolday rides up to the porch close to arly and julio}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{good morning, julio morning arly.}
<P>__{(to julio as he dismounts)}
<D>__{fetch my briefcase it's on my desk.}
<A>__{julio exits.}
<B>__{harolday turns his attention to arly who}
<A>__{still smarting under the disappointment about rocklin, seems lost in thought. after regarding her a moment harolday speaks.}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{looks like we're going to get that land we've been wanting along the river bottom.}
<A>__{arly turns her eyes on harolday, who continues.}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{i didn't tell you but i bought the mortgage on the hardman ranch, and it's due today on my way over there now.}
<A>__{arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{did you send that rocklin to table top?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{well, let's get things straight. this place was my mother's now it's mine and clint's it's true you've been helping out but the way things are going we'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe. meanwhile, i'm running this outfit and i expect to give the orders.}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{you generally do.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{why did you send rocklin up to table top?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{it seemed to me a good idea what with all this rustling going on }
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{who'd ever try driving cattle over table top? unless they were crazy.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i don't agree with you. in any case if you must have it i'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman!}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(dangerously)}
<D>__{you take care what you're saying.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(very controlled)}
<D>__{it's you should take care, my dear. i'm afraid there's one man you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want. you've made a fool of yourself over him once. better watch out you don't do it again.}
<A>__{he turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. juan is standing there with the briefcase which harolday takes with a yank, mounts his horse and rides out. the camera moves in close on arly, who stands in furious silence watching harolday ride away.}
