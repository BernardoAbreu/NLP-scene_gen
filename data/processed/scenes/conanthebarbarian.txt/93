<L>__{interior thieves' tavern afternoon}
<A>__{a rundown hall, built beneath the city. wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead. and within the hall, a gathering of thieves and rogues. they're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or even hands, evidence of khalar's cruel justice. they eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, wenches and serving women their cautious eyes following the cimmerian outsider. the one eyed thief takes them to an open table, and immediately three of the serving women descend upon conan, caressing him. tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a cough, even as a serving girl delivers mead to the table. conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women, their breasts practically framing his face.}
