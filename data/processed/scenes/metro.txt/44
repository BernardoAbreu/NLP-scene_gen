<L>__{interior ronnie's house night}
<A>__{roper enters. instantly we see he's at home here. he hangs his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices a photograph on the wall. quite imposing. very unique style.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{that a new picture?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{about 4 months old. i'm working in a new style.}
<A>__{roper gazes at it indifferently. he falls silent. thoughts turned inward. suddenly, troy, (the dog), bounds in. he's ecstatic to see roper. he puts his front paws on the couch and his head in roper's lap.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{hey, troy. how ya doin' boy?}
<P>__{(to ronnie)}
<D>__{he heard my voice.}
<A>__{roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence. his words are light. his tone isn't.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{how's the good dog. i miss you buddy. you miss me?}
<A>__{ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{he misses me.}
<A>__{she nods. a moment's silence.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i won't stay long. i had to talk to someone.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(a bit surprised at his openness)}
<D>__{you don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it was my fault. i was right downstairs. i should have gone up with him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{scott, you can't save everyone.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i've proved that, didn't i?}
<A>__{she's not coming closer. she wants to, but she won't do it. she seems uneasy, glances towards the door. roper rises.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{oh, hell, forget it. this won't work.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(gentle)}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{something i guess i can't have anymore.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{don't try to make me feel guilty. the whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. i can't do it. i can't be more than your friend. because i know what will happen. in a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(surprised, hurt)}
<D>__{you think i didn't need you?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{if you did, you never showed it.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{ronnie...}
<A>__{he reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a knock on the door. ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you expecting someone?}
<A>__{her silence is the answer... a flash of pain from roper.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{this day just keeps getting better.}
<A>__{ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{they're on the table where you always leave them.}
<A>__{he grabs the keys as she opens the door. greg stands outside waiting. he's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{hey, baby, i thought maybe you were...}
<A>__{greg's smile fades as he sees roper.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i was just leaving.}
<A>__{roper strides past greg who remains in the doorway. ronnie makes brief eye contact with greg, but then moves past him to follow roper. she calls after him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{scottie... take care of yourself.}
<A>__{roper doesn't look back. he just goes.}
