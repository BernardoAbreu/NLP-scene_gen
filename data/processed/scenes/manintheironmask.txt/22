<L>__{exterior paris streets day}
<A>__{magnificent public buildings palaces and cathedrals grace the city's skyline, but here in central paris all is squalor. on a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves. but interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon, and one of them, lieutenant andre, announces }
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{here is food, the gift of your loving king, on his birthday! he gives to himself by giving to you, in that he loves you so much!}
<A>__{slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward. as the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs bread, cabbages, tomatoes, eggs those nearest the wagon begin to jostle each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{no need to fight, there is plenty for all!}
<A>__{it's looking like a holiday celebration... until a ruffian breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose.}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{this stuff stinks. it is rotting! the king gives us rotten food!}
<A>__{he hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers. other paupers sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger: they throw food at the soldiers... then a paving stone crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the streets in the direction of the palace. d'artagnan, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner and sees the mob coming. and they see him: the elegant, dashing musketeer on the prancing stallion. and at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction. d'artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic.}
<C>__{panicked soldier}
<D>__{back, toward the palace! we cannot hold them off! we will fire a volley into them!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no! run to the palace and close the gates. but do not fire!}
<A>__{the two new soldiers race away; d'artagnan waits calmly on his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him. the mob, seeing the dashing musketeer wait so confidently for them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on.}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{come on! to the palace!}
<A>__{d'artagnan sits calmly in their way. he doesn't even draw his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his horse. some of the mob recognize him, and murmur...}
<C>__{mob}
<D>__{it's d'artagnan! le generale de musketeers!}
<A>__{the mob hesitates for the name d'artagnan means heroism and patriotism to all of them.}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{one musketeer can't stop us!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{stop you? you are frenchmen, are you not? i am one of you.}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{the king is a frenchman, but he is not one of us!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{citizens of paris! give ear to me!}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{we'll give you their ears!}
<A>__{with that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it to the ear of the young lieutenant who is already bloody from being dragged through the street.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{wait and listen! i beg you!}
<C>__{rioter}
<D>__{they give us garbage, not fit for rats! they think we are garbage!}
<A>__{with that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at d'artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement, he cuts the vegetable from the air. the display of expertise is startling. someone else throws a head of lettuce; d'artagnan slices it in half, and as the pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm on my way to a salad! doesn't anybody have any endive?}
<A>__{the mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of swordsmanship that lies behind it. someone tosses more lettuce, and d'artagnan divides and skewers this one as well. this time the crowd applauds.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{a tomato?}
<A>__{can he do it? someone fires a tomato right at his head, and sure enough d'artagnan spears it. then, with a victorious flourish, he takes a bite of it. his face contorts with the taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you are right. it is rotten. i will speak to the king myself. you have my word.}
<A>__{the mob is completely won over by d'artagnan; the ruffian, angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over the soldiers, but now the point of d'artagnan's sword flicks to the ruffian's neck.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{and you will release those men for they serve france... and you.}
<C>__{rioters}
<D>__{three cheers for d'artagnan! hurrah...!! hurrah...!!}
<A>__{the soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart now stand and look at d'artagnan in gratitude and awe. the mob has forgotten them; they see only d'artagnan as he rakes his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back toward the palace.}
