<A>__{morgan's hound sleeps in the corner while virgil and morgan shoot pool. wyatt looking on.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{...but he says did i actually see it happen and i said, no, when i arrived fred'd already been shot. so the judge said, can't have a murder without a witness case dismissed. can you beat it? after all that. oh hell, who cares, none of my business anyways.}
<A>__{clum enters, frowning and anxious, just as morgan sinks a shot.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{boy, i love this game. when we're finally set we gotta each have a billiard room in our houses.}
<C>__{clum}
<D>__{excuse me, wyatt, just a moment, please, i wanted to try and reason with you. we still haven't found a marshal and }
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{come on mayor, he already told you no.}
<C>__{clum}
<D>__{what about you? you were a lawman.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{i'm busy. we're all busy. sorry, mayor, but you're really barkin' up the wrong tree.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you tell 'em, virge.}
<A>__{clum exits shaking his head. they keep playing. after a beat:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you know, i was thinkin', maybe we ought to open our own place. that's the real money. build it up, milk it for all it's worth, then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings. let's you and me take a walk around town, virge, see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{i can't hardly believe it. it's working out just like you said, wyatt. we're lootin' this burg six ways through sunday.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{pretty fun too, isn't it?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{kinda, actually, yeah. i gotta admit.}
