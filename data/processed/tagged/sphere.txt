<A>__{fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps. apartment buildings line the curb, it is very quiet. in one building, six floors up, a bedroom light is on. we see the silhouette of norman's wife looking out the window.}
<C>__{wife }
<D>__{what kind of a crash was it?}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{you seen my suitcase?}
<C>__{wife }
<D>__{there's nothing on the news about a crash. did he say what airline?}

<C>__{norman }
<D>__{don't be so supportive, honey.}
<C>__{wife }
<D>__{well, i can't imagine five years of unemployment }
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{four. four years }
<C>__{wife }
<D>__{four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{keep watching the news. are you watching the news?}
<C>__{wife }
<D>__{how are you getting to the airport? you need money for the bus?}
<A>__{a tinted window black sedan travels down the street, pulls up in front of the apartment building. a u.s. navy decal is on the door.}

<A>__{norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back. he studies a pamphlet in his hand: "aircrash survival: how to cope". the pilot, in the cockpit, turns to him.}

<D>__{what kinda work you in, dr. johnson?}
<A>__{norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you've heard of me?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what report?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what report?}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{know what?}
<A>__{the pilot glances back at him again.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{must be another johnson then. been flying so many scientists out here can't keep everyone straight.}

<D>__{who's everyone?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{geologists? at a plane crash?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{strange, isn't it? in the middle of the ocean no less.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?}
<A>__{norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the water.}
<L>__{exterior ship deck day}
<A>__{the helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about. a young, female officer holding her hat to her head rushes to greet norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter. she looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{any other bags, dr. johnson?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{just that. careful, it's heavy.}
<A>__{she lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{no other equipment? scientific instruments?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no, they didn't say }
<C>__{officer}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{captain who?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{barnes. he's very eager to meet you. been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{as they march down a hallway, norman looks down at his wrinkled suit, tries to smooth it out.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{by the way sir, i've read your report. i think it's brilliant.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what report?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{you mean they haven't told you yet?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{told me what?}
<A>__{she staightens up, like she might have said too much.}

<L>__{interior barnes' office}
<A>__{captain harold barnes, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on the phone.}

<D>__{how's he look?... well, we can't all be officers, can we?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{they tell me he's brilliant.}
<L>__{exterior barnes' office}
<A>__{norman stands in front of the door. the doorplate reads: project commander captain harold barnes. norman straightens his big knotted tie. deep breath.}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{thank you, colonel.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{captain.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{captain. right, forgive me.}
<A>__{barnes looks at norman, sizing him up. an akward silence.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{well, thanks for the opportuninty here my wife appreciates it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{don't thank me, dr. johnson. you weren't my choice. the pentagon made me take you.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{the pentagon? i didn't know i had friends in washington.}
<A>__{norman tries to laugh as barnes ushers him to the door...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{come with me. the team's already waiting.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what team?}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{barnes leads norman down the corridor, lined with officers and guards.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what have you been told so far?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the usual. plane crash. survivers unknown. routine stuff really.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{nothing else.}
<A>__{a guard unlocks a large, steel door.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{captain barnes. dr. johnson.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway, wondering how the guard knows his name.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you talk to any reporters? any press?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{press? no, i haven't.}
<A>__{the steel door shuts loudly behind them.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{good. security's been our biggest worry. now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{from what? what's with all the security?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{well, we don't have all the facts yet.}
<A>__{another guard opens up another large steel door...}
<L>__{interior tech room}
<A>__{barnes leads norman through the room, crammed with video monitors, screens, and grids. officers talk into radios. technicians work on computers.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we're moving fast considering the storm.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{storm? what storm?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{a cyclone's on it's way in. i thought they would have told you on the phone.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they didn't tell me anything.}
<A>__{norman tries to keep pace...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we've had divers working around the clock. take a look at this...}
<A>__{angle on a large video screen shows a diver walking on the ocean floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{how deep is he?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{a thousand feet.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{a thousand? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water i don't want to sound pessimistic here, but i assume there are no survivors.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{survivors? no, i wouldn't think so.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{then why am i here?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what do you need me for?}
<A>__{on the video screen the diver shines his light on a large, metallic}
<B>__{object.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what crashed wasn't an airplane, dr. johnson. it's a bit larger than that.}
<A>__{barnes walks toward a technician, sitting at a keyboard.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(to technician)}
<D>__{bring up the grid, would you?}
<A>__{angle on the monitor as an image of the craft begins to form.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what is it? a military spacecraft? like a shuttle or satellite?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{something like that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that doesn't surprise you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{not really, no. something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... when did it crash?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{as best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{four hundred? you're kidding, right?}
<A>__{angle on the monitor showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of rock above it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{see this? coral. geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{geologists?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ wait a second }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{ dating the crash at least that old.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{hold on }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{maybe older }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ there's got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft? there's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{extraordinary, isn't it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{i'm afraid it is dr. johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.}
<L>__{interior stairwell}
<A>__{barnes and norman shuffle down the stairs.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{off the record, i don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we think it might. that's why we brought you here. we've assembled your team they're waiting for us now.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what team?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{the one you recommended. in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ulf report? nobody's mentioned that in years. you mean someone actually read it?}
<A>__{as they head down a hallway, barnes pulls the ulf report out from under his arm, hands it to norman. norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{your report's become our bible down here, dr. johnson. we've been carrying out each of your recommendations one by one to the smallest detail.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{but sir, i don't understand. this report these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra terrestrial life.}
<L>__{interior briefing room}
<A>__{on a video screen sonar video of the spacecraft.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{how big is this spacecraft?}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty six hundred feet.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{a half a mile long?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.}
<A>__{the team members sit around the conference table: ted fielding, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here. beth halperin, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron. arthur levine, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet. harry adams, 32, mathamatician, african american, wire glasses, no bullshit.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how much damage?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{to the craft? none. not a scratch.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{right. so you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{i'm not saying anything, harry, i'm just stating the facts.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy resin honeycomb. the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{never invented?}
<A>__{on norman, watching the team...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{in basic english, what does all this mean?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{basic english? there's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.}
<B>__{a loud mechanical whirr}
<L>__{interior testing room later}
<A>__{a large, x ray apparatus moves to the side, revealing norman's face. on beth standing next to him.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{five years. no phone calls. what am i a leper?}
<A>__{norman sits up...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth, look, can i trust you with a little secret?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i love secrets.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that ulf report everybody's patting me on the back about?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i've read it twice, norman. it's brilliant.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's bullshit. the report's a joke.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's quite a secret.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i spent a week reading sagan and watching re runs of the twilight zone. seriously. i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house i had no idea }
<A>__{angle on two navy corpsmen, standing behind glass in the next room, monitoring beth and norman.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{do yourself a favor, norman. are you listening? don't tell anyone what you just told me.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{c'mon, beth that report's like the blind leading the blind.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{because when we get down there }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{wait down where?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{to the spacecraft. to investigate.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{underwater?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what do you expect? for them to bring it up here?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{we can't go down there. we're not prepared. that deep? that takes years of training, beth. we're just scientists. lab scietists. we wear ties and lab coats to work not oxygen tanks.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. in the ocean.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{70 percent of the earth's surface is water, norman. that's first grade geography.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it never occurred to me.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. have you said anything to barnes about this?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the timing has never seemed quite right.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{just keep your mouth shut, alright? this could mean everything to our careers, you know that? don't jeopardize this.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(nervous laughter)}
<D>__{what are you threatening me?}
<L>__{exterior ship late at night}
<A>__{the sky clouds looming on the horizon. angle on arthur levine, leaning against the railing, looking out at the water. on norman, approaching him. arthur never looks at norman, he just stares out at the water.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't know you, but i will be honest with you. i don't like this. i don't like any of this. especially, the water.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{seasick? a marine biologist?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't belong here. none of us belong here. look at that.}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's wrong with oxygen?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{it's a corrosive gas. on earth, it makes a half eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an oldsmobile. at a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile.}
