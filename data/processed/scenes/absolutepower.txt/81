<A>__{luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand, carrying his backpack he slows as he circles the body of christy sullivan, looks sadly down at her, continues on as we move to... the bed table. first, luther opens the drawer and pockets the necklace. tense, he kneels, probes behind the table, reaches farther and then the letter opener! in the plastic bag. luther grabs it. he rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house. he looks out, grimaces.}
