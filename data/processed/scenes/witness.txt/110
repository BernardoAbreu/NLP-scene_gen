<A>__{the barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. it's late afternoon.}
<B>__{angle on book}
<A>__{he hesitates. his face is pale and covered with sweat. the exertion of the day has taken its toll. he's in danger of fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. but he's determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. hochstetler guesses the situation. he moves beside book, claps an arm about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at book. from below, someone tells them to hurry up. hochstetler shouts:}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{we admire our work!}
<A>__{the moment passes for book, and he's okay. hochstetler removes his supporting arm. book looks him in the eye, nods his appreciation almost imperceptibly. hochstetler wants no thanks, and book knows it. hochstetler gives him a resounding slap on the back, and starts climbing down. book follows.}
