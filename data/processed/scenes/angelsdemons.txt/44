<L>__{int a dark space day}
<A>__{in a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of hot water. an elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual suit, no tie, hums softly to himself as he steeps his tea. no idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about mr. gray. the tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of sterno. while mr. gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something to his right. money. a lot of it, in a number of different denominations, neatly segmented in a briefcase. and three passports, all different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it. satisfied, mr. gray clicks the briefcase shut and slides it under the table, tucking it up against the wall. he removes the cup from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag. he walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls. he heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape earlier the kidnapped cardinals. he stops at the last cell, where the man, cardinal lamasse, looks up at him from the wooden bench he's sitting on.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{you have no idea what you're missing.}
<C>__{lamasse}
<D>__{conclave will go on without us. the voice of god will not be silenced.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{i was referring to my tea. last chance, i'd be happy to make you a cup.}
<C>__{lamasse}
<D>__{may god forgive you for what you've done.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{father, if god has issues they won't be with what i've done }
<P>__{(seems genuinely saddened)}
<D>__{ but with what i'm about to do.}
<A>__{a moment later, mr. gray's hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into a fireplace, where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry kindling. he picks up something else and places it in the heart of the flames. a long handled iron rod.}
