<L>__{interior kendall's hospital room day}
<A>__{hardy and osborne reenter, smiling. kendall chuckles.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{something funny, levi?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.}
<A>__{hardy pulls the out microrecorder and hands it to osborne.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why don't you talk to levi off the record for a second?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{good idea.}
<A>__{smiling, she stops the tape. then turns to kendall.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you and dunbar got your stories straight. little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you. you think you're just going to slide out of this? you're an accessory to murder, levi, you're going to jail }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you can't threaten me }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{didn't do anything }
<A>__{osborne laughs.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, levi. we're going to find those bodies and when we do, i'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that's a fantastic idea }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{see, i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission }
<C>__{kendall}
<P>__{(beginning to panic)}
<D>__{it won't work }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it will and you know why?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the united states army; you have no identity, no miranda warning, and no rights. so i'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you i'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!}
<A>__{she finishes, breathing hard. kendall, totally cowed. hardy, trying to suppress a smile. osborne rises for the door.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{enjoy your flight to washington }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{wait }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what.}
<A>__{silence. kendall takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{dunbar's telling the truth.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{wrong answer }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{we did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was because i threatened him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because of what i saw.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who really killed west.}
<A>__{osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{who killed sergeant west?}
<A>__{kendall stares at the recorder. a long pause.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{who, levi }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{childs.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because i was standing next to him.}
<A>__{he pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i was in on the px thing. he and mueller and me, we were making thousands. west found out. childs said we were just gonna scare him use my dad's clout. i had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. we met him in the creek bed but before i said anything...}
