<A>__{donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps ted onto the floor. ted looks around. it's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside. on the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc. most are from press from ted's media heyday, but some are photographs of ted and john out in public that donny clearly took himself.}
