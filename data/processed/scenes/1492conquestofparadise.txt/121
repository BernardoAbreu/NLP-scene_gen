<A>__{they are drinking and smoking cigars. from the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away. giacomo is already dozing in his chair. bartolome sees it, and elbows columbus. they both smile at their younger brother's exhaustion. then columbus gets up and leans on the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle beyond.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{how much gold have we found?}
<C>__{bartolome}
<D>__{not enough to justify a single shipment.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination.}
<C>__{bartolome}
<D>__{then let's hope not...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what will happen if we can't find enough gold?}
<A>__{they begin to hear the sound of a flute a melancholy sound. columbus looks out over the jungle, and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(jokingly)}
<D>__{then i'm governor of the mosquitoes.}
