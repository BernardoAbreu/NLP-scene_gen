<L>__{interior subway tunnel subway car roof day}
<A>__{rocketing underground. the tunnel ceiling whizzes by above fait and daria. intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches from their heads. every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward the edge. fait places a calming hand on top of daria's. the car takes a wide curve. daria's body flips to the side. she loses her grip. screams as she starts to fall off the train. fait reaches for daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off the train. fait can't grab her. the train jerks again. he starts sliding away from her, off the opposite side. fait thrusts out both hands as far as he can. and... just snags her at the last second. grips daria's wrists with all he's got. they're now draped across the curved roof of the train. hands in the middle. if daria slips, or fait lets her go, they both die.}
