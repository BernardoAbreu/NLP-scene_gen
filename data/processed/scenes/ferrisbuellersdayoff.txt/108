<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{would i risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if i didn't love you?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{would i have introduced you as my wife if i didn't love you?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{wait a minute. that was a lie.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{true.}
<A>__{ferris puts his arm around sloane.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{would you want to get married? i mean if i wasn't an asshole.}

<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i will do it, if you will.}
<A>__{cameron suddenly adds his two cents.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you need a blood test.}
<A>__{ferris looks around at him.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{if your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. the state requires a blood test.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so, you can't get married today.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{tomorrow?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{if you get a blood test today.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{i'm not getting married.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i'm with you, babe.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{what do you mean, why not? think about it.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i will give you two. my mother and father.}
<A>__{ferris and sloane look at him curiously.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{they're married and they hate each other.}
<P>__{(to ferris)}
<D>__{you've seen them. am i right?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{you're father's a toad and your mom's always wired out, but so what? they're old. that's natural.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{it makes me puke. seeing people treat each other like that. it's like the car. he loves the car. he hates his wife.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{my parents are divorced. so what? it's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{just because it happens doesn't make it right. are you comfortable with it?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{no. it's not something i can get comfortable with. i've tried. are yours divorced?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{they may as well be.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{do you think they're staying together because of you?}
<A>__{cameron hasn't seen it that way. he shrugs.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{do they like you?}
<A>__{it hasn't occured to cameron that his parents might not like him. that parental love might not be a given.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{yeah. sure.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. he dropped us like a rock. everything was cool at our house. i thought so. we all thought so. then blam! it's over.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{this is all news to me. she keeps a pretty good secret.}
<C>__{sloane}
<P>__{(to cameron)}
<D>__{it was pure selfishness. when i have a kid, i don't care how much i want something, if it's gonna screw up the kid, forget it.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{she's not lying.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you could change.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{yeah. but i'm gonna try not to. i'm gonna think about it. i'm gonna try to prevent it.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{this is optomism. it's a common trait with my age group. adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth. but it's a cool thing and i think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. they wish they had her, too.}
<P>__{(points to sloane)}
<D>__{sorry. she's taken.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{well, you know what? it ain't up to you. it's out of your hands.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so, i in other words, i should just sit back and watch it crumble?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{you're merely an inhabitant in their universe.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{frightening choice of words.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{they call the shots. when you split from them, you call the shots.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so, you're saying i should run away?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{no. she's saying it's time for lunch.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{let's go feed cameron.}
<A>__{they stand up and head out. ferris hangs back a moment. he cups his hands to his mouth. he yells at the top of his voice.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{buy!}
<A>__{and he exits. cool and casual.}
