<D>__{i can't kill myself, marty. you see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. stella randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now. by killing her i took her physical life but saved her life eternal. you see, marty? you see how all things serve the will and the mind of god? you see, you meddling little shit!}
