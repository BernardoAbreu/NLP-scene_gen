<A>__{this is terrain never before seen in this picture. (lake powell location, a few miles northeast of wahweap). the party can be seen on the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast, irregular river of deep blue water. taylor, cornelius and lucius are unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the backs of horses. zira watches them. a 321 closer angle the group zira wanders off, falls to her knees.}
