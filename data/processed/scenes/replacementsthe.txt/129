<A>__{everyone is just about dressed in their uniforms and ready to go. lou pacifico enters in street clothes and starts undressing quickly. he looks worried. shane watches lou for a beat. we see shane shift his upper body and grimace. mcginty enters and pulls shane aside.}
<D>__{mcginty congratulations. it's official. you're staying on after the strike.}
<A>__{shane smiles in spite of the pain.}
<D>__{mcginty it's probably better that you not say anything to the rest of the guys until after the game. okay?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{whatever you say, coach.}
<A>__{mcginty walks into the middle of the locker room and goes into pre game speech mode.}
<D>__{mcginty alright, listen up. the strike is just about history. by tomorrow, you will no longer be redskins. it's important that you leave here, however, with the knowledge that you have made a difference in your own life, in the owner's life or what's left of it and especially the fans'. you have proven to a skeptical america that sports is not about contracts, or agents or shoe deals. sports is about rising to the occasion. we have one more opportunity tonight to do that, one more chance to show what heart is all about. the dallas cowboys are waiting out there to kill you. i expect nothing less than for you to win even in your death throes. we have a powerful weapon on our side tonight: there is no tomorrow for most of you. and that makes you very dangerous people. use it.}
