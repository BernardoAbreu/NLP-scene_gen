<L>__{interior christian house, mr christian's office night}
<A>__{mrs. christian and welles enter. this office has been lived in for a lifetime. giant desk. american flag. walls covered in old b+w photographs and achievements. a large, baked enamel sign nailed up, "christian steel."}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{his inner sanctum.}
<A>__{welles looks up at the oil painting over the fireplace: mr. christian, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming, industrial landscape behind him.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{not many people have been inside this room.}
<A>__{welles examines photos of mr. christian visiting various steel plants, coal mines and ground breaking ceremonies, shaking hands with workmen, with politicians.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{pittsburgh?}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{mostly. that's where he started his empire building.}
<P>__{(looks up at portrait)}
<D>__{he was a good man. notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. he wanted}
<A>__{to be}
<D>__{legendary.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he succeeded.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{we were married forty five years. hard even for me to imagine. we had our troubles. there were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and i to him. i loved him deeply.}
<A>__{welles waits.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{do you carry a gun, mr. welles?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to. other than that, there's never any reason.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{just curious.}
<A>__{mrs. christian crosses to take down a picture, revealing a wall safe. the safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. i knew about it, but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business. not till now, that is.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you hired someone to open it. i will bet the lawyer loved that.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{there was nothing he could do. my husband left everything to me.}
<P>__{(looks at safe)}
<D>__{i prevented anyone from seeing the contents. i felt these were my husband's private things. i didn't... i didn't realize...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{do you want to tell me what you found?}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{cash, stock certificates, and this...}
<A>__{she takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a plastic bag containing a short 8mm film on a plastic reel.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{it's a film... of a girl being murdered.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm afraid i don't...}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{this is a movie showing a girl being murdered. she's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i only watched what i could.}
<A>__{welles picks up the film, looks at it.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i didn't know what to think. i can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. to know that he watched this... this atrocity. but, i can't go to the police...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{mrs. christian... please, will you sit down a moment?}
<P>__{(leads her to a chair)}
<D>__{i want you to listen carefully. what you're talking about is a "snuff film." but, from what i know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. like, red light district folklore. there's no such thing, i can assure you.}
<A>__{mrs. christian shakes her head.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{please, believe me. this is probably a stag film. simulated rape. hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i'm telling you it's not that.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm sure it is.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. more than likely he never even watched it.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{will you watch it and see for yourself?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{of course. but, i'm certain it's nothing to worry about.}
