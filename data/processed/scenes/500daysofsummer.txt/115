<A>__{tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. a punkish pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down to. he's excited. he tucks his shirt into his pants. he ties his tie. he brushes his teeth with aplomb. he looks for, finds, and plucks a grey hair from his head. he makes some faces into the mirror. satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.}
