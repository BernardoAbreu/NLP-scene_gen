<L>__{interior farmhouse otis's room day}
<A>__{mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. sunlight peers through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered remains of rotted curtains. peeling yellowed newspaper serves as wallpaper surrounding the window. mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a big eyed kitten. she stares at it and smiles. a look of horror begins to appear on her face. she begins to scream uncontrollably.}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{shut your fucking mouth!}
<A>__{she is hysterical.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{i said shut your mouth!}
<A>__{zoom back to see mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair, facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. this is otis's art studio. otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint brush and calmly walks over to mary. he spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his hand and leans his nose against hers.}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(slow and sinister)}
<D>__{listen, you malibu barbie middle class piece of shit. i'm trying to work, you got me, work... you ever work?}
<A>__{mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{yeah, i will bet you did. scooping ice cream to your shitheel friends on summer break... well, i ain't talking about white socks with mickey mouse on one side and donald duck on the other... shit, you ain't reading no funny books, mamma.}
<A>__{otis raises his paint covered hand.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{this is blood and guts, suzy q. our bodies come and go, but this blood is forever...}
<P>__{(pulls a small book from his breast pocket)}
<D>__{...let me read you something, listen and learn... you listening?}
<A>__{otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the face with the book. she nods again. he lowers the book.}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(gesturing dramatically)}
<D>__{and the angels, all pallid and wan, uprising, unveiling, affirm that the play is the tragedy "man" and its hero the conqueror worm...}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{...you get that? art is eternal, you get me, mamma?}
<A>__{mary stares dumbfounded.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{now, i'm gonna remove my hand... you make a sound and i swear i will slit you open and make you eat your own fucking intestines... you get me?}
<A>__{she nods again. he slowly removes his hand from her mouth. mary tries to remain calm, but starts to hyperventilate. tears roll down her face.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{why? why are you doing this?}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{doing what? messy up your day? well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!}

<D>__{well, bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... i couldn't have asked for a better specimen. i mean you don't know what a dry spell i've had, total block...}
<P>__{(slaps his forehead)}
<D>__{...total block... but bill he's ok.}
<A>__{mary looks confused, but relieved.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{let's go see.}
<A>__{otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the room towards a curtained off area. whoosh! he pulls her through the curtains. from behind the curtain we hear mary screaming and otis laughing.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(behind curtain)}
<D>__{bill? no, no, no! what have you done? bill!}
