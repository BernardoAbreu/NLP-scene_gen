<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{fuck it!}
<A>__{claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the neighbor's yard: a naked man, 40's, crouches. arms extend from below and pull him downward. his ass pokes up over the weeds.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{honey, you're up.}
<A>__{claude shakes out of his reverie. he walks briskly up to his ball and smacks it. it bullets forward and lands just short of pauline's ball.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{claude, don't just whack it. think about it before you hit.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{pauline knocks her ball into claude's. she holds her ball down with her foot and prepares to swing.}
<C>__{malcolm}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pauline! see, i knew you couldn't... your feet are too small!}
<A>__{margot steps up to take her turn. she regards the house.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you took the awnings down.}
<A>__{claude looks back into the adjacent yard: flashes of skin. a breast. pubic hair. claude crouches to see more clearly the bodies disappear from sight. malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes. he swings his ball rockets past margot's, rolls up over a ridge and onto the cement drive. it quickly sails down into the road and bounces into a ditch. malcolm shakes furiously. he lifts his mallet, turns toward the house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the incline and down to the water. pauline puts her hands on her hips.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach. claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.}

<D>__{honey, you're up.}
<A>__{he approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double wickets.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're going the wrong way.}

<A>__{margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{we're in the middle of it.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{this is why i hate games. i hate what it does to me.}
<A>__{pauline cackles loudly. margot turns around and stares at her. malcolm calls from the stairs:}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{wait, we're not finished!}
