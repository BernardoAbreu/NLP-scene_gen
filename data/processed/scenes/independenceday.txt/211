<L>__{exterior security gate same}
<A>__{four armed guards watch the gate. an armada of trucks and trailers heads right for them. they move into position to block their entrance as a blue pick up skids to a halt before them. steve stands up from the back of the pick up.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{sorry, lt. colonel, i can't open the gates without clearance.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you want to see my clearance?}
<A>__{impatiently steve grabs the guard by the collar, pulling him over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the bundled parachute in the flatbed. steve rips the fabric aside revealing...}
<B>__{the alien creature}
<A>__{still unconscious, the alien stirs. the guard jumps back, shitting in his pants. quickly he signals for the other to open the gate. the armada quickly drives past.}
<B>__{blackness}
<A>__{total darkness. suddenly light pours in as a door is open. we see the faces of okun, david and three technicians all peering at us with inquisitive expressions.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{see the gizmos flashing?}
<A>__{reverse inside alien craft sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing. high tech meets organic organisms. this alien ship looks familiar to our own technology and completely different at the same time.}
<C>__{okun }
<D>__{we've been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap. some stuff we figured out right away.}
<A>__{david climbs in, fascinated. he touches everything. okun points to everything as he describes it.}
<C>__{okun }
<D>__{this thing we're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin, this do hickey over here is connected with the engines, this crap...we have no idea what that stuff is for.}
<A>__{david is transfixed by it. he stares at the small screens with flashing light patterns on them.}
<C>__{okun }
<D>__{but this over here is clearly what they use to navigate and guide the craft.}
<A>__{but david still stares at the small screens.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{someone grab my laptop for me?}
<A>__{one of the technicians rushes off as okun leans close.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{find something interesting?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{the technician hands david his retrieved laptop which he quickly flips open and turns on.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{these patterns here, they're repeating sequentially, just like...}
<A>__{david turns his laptop around for okun to see. the pattern on david's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{...their countdown signal. their using this frequency for computer communications. it's how they co ordinate their ships.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{you know, you're really starting to make us look bad.}
<A>__{the two men exchange a smile. another techy pops his head inside.}
<C>__{techy}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{they got one! they got one, alive!}
