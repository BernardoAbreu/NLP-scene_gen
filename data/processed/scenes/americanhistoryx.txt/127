<C>__{cammeron}
<P>__{(bloody and beaten)}
<D>__{derek, man. what are you doing’?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(teary eyed)}
<D>__{why, cam? why’d you set me up?! because you think of me as a fucking brother?!}
<C>__{cammeron}
<P>__{(slowly, mumbling)}
<D>__{i’m gonna...}
<A>__{derek bangs cam’s face against the mirror once more.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{shut the fuck up! you’re not doing anything.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{do you understand what you put me through, you fucking cunt?! do you!?}
<A>__{derek slams cammeron’s face into the mirror three more times. blood squirts on both of them and the entire bathroom.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{ssell me the shit to re sell... hire a couple of scumbags to steal it back... use me as the fall guy. double your profit. i got great friends, don’t i?!}
<A>__{derek rinses cam’s bloody face off by plunging it into the toilet. he pulls him back up, they turn and face the mirror.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{and seth was drivin’, right? course he was. anybody else would’ve hit me.}
<A>__{derek stares at him in grave silence. cammeron retaliates again. he forcefully backs derek into the wall behind him. he throws two punches at derek – one in the stomach and one to the face that opens his lip. he misses on the third and derek proceeds to kick the living hell out of him. back to the mirror. cammeron is completely pummeled, derek grinds his face into the glass.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{see what shit looks like?}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{your life…is over.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it already was with you in it.}
<A>__{derek throws a bloody cameron through the shower curtain and he slams his head against the wall. he falls in the tub, unconscious. derek looks at him, grabs a small towel for his lip, and exits.}
