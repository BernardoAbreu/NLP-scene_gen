<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{hatsue miyamoto in the witness box. graceful, erect, her porcelain beauty accessible, eager to cooperate. humble.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{hopeful. is the word i would use.}
<A>__{and nels seems slightly surprised.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but carl didn't say yes.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{he didn't say no. that was kabuo's pointerior given how carl's mother felt, carl was still willing to consider selling to us. it was a good sign.}
<A>__{nels considers that.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, in the week that followed, the week before carl's death... did your husband pursue him?}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{no. kabuo did not wish to beg, he respected carl's right to reflect. he was sure carl would do the honorable thing.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{and did he?}
<A>__{she nods. only once. her eyes bright.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{the night of the 15th, kabuo helped carl at sea. with his dead battery.}
<A>__{nels raises his eyebrows. to give the point its weight.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{right there, on the boat, they agreed. $8400 for the seven acres, $800 down. they shook on it. kabuo was so excited when he came home.}
<A>__{nels lets that sit. and sit.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and when did you first learn. that carl had drowned?}
<A>__{the slightest pause. as if hesitant to confess...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{one o'clock, that afternoon, from a clerk at petersen's.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{and alvin hooks rises. perches on the edge of the prosecutor's table. and looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{your husband came home agitated, after his encounter with the deceased?}
<A>__{no impatience across her perfect features. only earnestness will do.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i said 'excited'. not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{happy for him. and relieved.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. yes?}
<P>__{hatsue (calm, respectful)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{really? didn't call your mother, your sisters, about starting a new life. your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated.}
<A>__{hatsue shifts in her chair. smooths her skirt.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we hear how carl...passed away. only a few hours later.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{closer to eight.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so, five hours. plenty of time for a call. he was 'excited', you say. in the sense of being 'overjoyed'.}
<A>__{she nods, he was.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we are...cautious people. you would say conservative. there would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed.}
<A>__{hooks pouts. he allows himself that.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you thought the deceased might... break his promise?}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{of course not. we're just not quick to run and boast. in case something went wrong.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and then, something did. carl heine was found dead. with his head crushed.}
<A>__{she weathers that last part. as if taking no notice.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{yes, and then, what was there to call about? everything was up in the air.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{up in the air? was that your reaction?}
<A>__{and he rises. tastefully indignant.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i would suggest that more happened than a land sale evaporating. a man died , mrs. miyamoto. a husband and father of small children had his skull bashed in!}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{if you mean to imply that we were callous about carl's death, that is wrong and insulting.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i see. well, did you come forward to tell sheriff moran what you knew? the encounter in the fog, the...dead battery, was it?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we discussed that. and decided not to.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she looks at him with the directness we've seen before.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?}
<A>__{her eyes cut to nels. he smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by looking to him for support. her gaze goes down now. and then... ...back up. straight to hooks.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{trials aren't only about truth, mr. hooks. even though they should be. they're about what people believe is true.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so you hid the truth. deliberately.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we were afraid. silence seemed better. to come forward seemed like a mistake.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, it seems to me...}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{objection. mr. hooks can give his view in his summation.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{doesn't it seem to you , mrs. miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{it seems human. to me.}
<A>__{oh. hooks raises his brows.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i suppose that you mean this excuses concealing the truth. then why ahouls any of us believe you now?}
<A>__{and in the silence...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{question withdrawn, you may step down.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you're implying th...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i said. no further questions.}
<A>__{anger flashes across her eyes. her face colors. she draws a breath...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{that's enough, mrs. miyamoto, not another word. step down, please.}
<A>__{she looks to nels in her desperation and regret for making things worse. he chuckles and waves. it's quite all right. she sits for a frozen moment. and as she rises... the boys in the reporter's row are scribbling furiously. all but one.}
