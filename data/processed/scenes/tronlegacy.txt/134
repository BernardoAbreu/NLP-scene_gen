<D>__{flynn! keep moving! this way!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, mega.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i linked with meg. users exist. she instructed me.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{go, meg!}
<A>__{she glances over the new "tronified" rush. despite herself, she's impressed. but there's no time for talk.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{which way to the power supply?!}
<C>__{krod}
<P>__{(scanning)}
<D>__{ummmm... that way!}
