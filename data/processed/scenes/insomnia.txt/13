<L>__{interior will's room night}
<A>__{will's asleep. kay connell's folder open on his chest. it's dark in his room, quiet. suddenly the shade on his window quivers and snaps up, flooding the room with light. will's eyes pop open. he rolls over to look at the clock:}
<L>__{3:15. squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.}
<A>__{we can see the rest of his scar. runs down deep across his sternum. he yanks the shade back down. it bucks, then settles. satisfied, will returns to bed. plumps the pillow, pulls the blanket up around him. closes his eyes. the shade lurches halfway. then snaps back up. light pours in. will's eyes open.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you got to be kidding me.}
