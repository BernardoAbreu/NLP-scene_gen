<L>__{exterior jammed motorway night}
<A>__{james walks back alone, eventually spotting them among the throng of spectators, catherine watching vaughan's scarred face intently, provocatively, as he photographs every aspect of the accident. there is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the heads of the occupants. and now vaughan poses an only slightly reluctant catherine against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she were one of the shaken survivors of the accident. when the roof of the sports sedan is levered up, the hair of the driver, its only passenger, comes off with it as though scalped, stuck to the roofliner with drying blood. but it's soon apparent that it's not hair, but rather a cheap, tangled, platinum blond wig. vaughan makes his way over to the sedan, intrigued by the dangling 'scalp', which is almost phosphorescent in the road rescue work lights. catherine trails obediently behind him, like a harshly disciplined puppy. when the body of the driver is exposed to the lights, the effect is doubly grotesque, for not only is the driver dead and partially crushed, but he is also a cross dresser: seagrave, in jayne mansfield drag. his long, greasy hair is tied up in a knot on his head, he is unshaven, his huge, fake bosom is bloody and askew; his bloated, muscular body strains against the pink 60s skirt and jacket, the blue suede boots with high heels. there is also a dead chihuahua bitch inside the car with seagrave, which vaughan manages to move with his foot until a cop, outraged, shoos him away. the dog is stiff with rigor mortis, obviously dead long before the crash. an excited vaughan has spotted james and now approaches him, breathless.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{it's seagrave. he was worried that we would never do jayne mansfield's crash, now that the police were cracking down. so he did it himself.}
<A>__{vaughan turns back to look at the wreck again, almost reverent. this is seagrave's own solitary work of art.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{the dog god, the dog is brilliant, perfect. i wonder where he got it?}
<A>__{now vaughan turns to james, his face flushed, incandescent with joy.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{come with me, james. i have to document it.}
<A>__{vaughan lopes off toward the seagrave wreck. but james hangs back, watching, as the passengers from the taxi are carried on stretchers to an ambulance. the dead chauffeur of the limousine lies with a blanket over his face, while a doctor and two ambulance men climb into the rear compartment. beyond them, vaughan begins to snap away at every possible aspect of seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead chihuahua.}
