<L>__{interior kicking bird's lodge day}
<A>__{kicking bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but he is preoccupied with something. there is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and ten bears peers in.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<A>__{the little boy races over to the old chief, kicking bird makes a move to pull him back, but ten bears indicates the boy should stay.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{no, no let him sit with me.}
<A>__{there is silence as the two men settle themselves by the fire, the little boy content in ten bears' lap.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{our country seems good this summer, but i have not been out to see it.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{yes... it is good. the grass is rich. the game is plenty and not running away.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{i am glad to hear it. but the buffalo are late. i always worry about the bellies of our children.}
<A>__{a brief silence.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{i was thinking of a dance.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{yes, a dance is always a good idea. it would be good to have a strong sign.}
<A>__{kicking bird seems suddenly uncomfortable. the little boy leaves.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{there's a funny thing about signs. they are always flying in our faces. we know when they are bad or good but sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them. sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign into himself and let it run around for two or three days. if he is still confused he will tell somebody. he might come to you or to me and tell it. a smart man always does that.}
<A>__{ten bears picks up the pipe and puffs away, seemingly without care.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{i have seen such a sign.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{i saw a man, a white man.}
<A>__{ten bears' eyes get big for a moment. then he thinks.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{just one?}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{just one. he was naked.}
<A>__{ten bears thinks some more.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{are you sure it was a man?}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{i saw his sex.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{did you speak to him?}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{ten bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{we will council on this.}
