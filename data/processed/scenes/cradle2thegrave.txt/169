<A>__{the pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from crashing.}
<L>__{exterior airfield}
<A>__{the out of control agusta swings back toward su and the hangar, losing altitude. then smashes into the tarmac, ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle around su before crashing into another chopper and bursting}
<L>__{into flames.}
<A>__{the spilled fuel ignites. a circle of intense fire. with su in the middle. the agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the circle. but ling's only path of escape takes him inside. into the circle. he emerges with the bag of stones. su is waiting.}
<C>__{ling}
<D>__{you were lucky last time. you won't be lucky again.}
<A>__{the final fight begins. the two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire, using everything they can lay their hands on. each the equal of the other. each knowing it's a fight to the death. for a long time, the fight could go either way. until... ling gets an arm around su's neck. like charles, su thrashes and flails. like charles, he can't get away.}
<C>__{ling}
<D>__{i will kill you fast. you won't feel a thing.}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{... i won't. you will}
<A>__{what happens next happens in an instant: su breaks the hold. hooks one of ling's arms. wrenches it. a direction it can't go. ling's arm bones snap, tissues rip. ling screams in pain. just as... su pulls the ceramic capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from ling's pocket. and... slams the capsule deep into ling's open mouth. ling gags, choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. his horror stricken eyes meet su's. su lets him suffer another moment. then, in subtitled chinese }
<C>__{su}
<D>__{this is for our friends.}
<A>__{and su strikes him in the throat. a spearing, open hand blow with his fingertips. hard. hard enough that... inside ling's throat the ceramic capsule shatters. releasing the hot, glowing white sliver of stone into ling's windpipe. the fragment's super high energy radiation instantly beginning to cook ling's body from within. the power of a few thousand microwave ovens turned on all at once. ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...}
<B>__{angle back on ling}
<A>__{as, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, ling flash cooks from the inside out. not simply burned. horribly desiccated. his seared and darkened skin shrink wrapped, mummy like, around his skeleton. human jerky. in a moment, it's finished. ling's dry roasted remains topple over. su has closed a chapter. same scene moments later su and fait meet on the tarmac. su has the stones. fait's holding vanessa, asleep in his arms. sirens approach in b.g. the two men regard each other a moment.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{we got it all.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what happens to the stones?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{they'll be destroyed.}
<A>__{they see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive in b.g.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{looks like i will be doing some jail time.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{jail? man, you just helped save the planet. law's gotta allow for that.}
<A>__{a look between fait and su. su nods.}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{i will do what i can.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{that's good, 'cause i mean, we make a helluva team, y'know?}
<P>__{(to su)}
<D>__{well, not you, 'cause you're law enforcement. but the rest of us look, a white guy comes in handy now and then. y'know, if you're pulling a job in beverly hills or ripping off a country club or whatever... what kind of percentage are we talking?}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{we're not.}
<A>__{fait looks at vanessa again. finding a new purpose in her eyes. beat.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{time i got real.}
<A>__{he regards the others.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{time we all did.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{get real? what's that mean?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{... means we're through with that life.}
