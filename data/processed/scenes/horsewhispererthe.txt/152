<A>__{joe, hat tipped low, is riding his horse, leading some young horses, exercising them in the morning pasture. he sees grace, walking with her cane, coming across the pasture.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{hi...}
<A>__{she stops. after a beat;}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{would you let me ride your horse?}

<A>__{she nods. he hesitates.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{are you going to give me a hand or aren't you?}
<A>__{he gets off his horse and holds it. she puts down her cane, then puts her hand on the saddle horn. she puts her prosthetic leg into a stirrup. frightened, she starts to shake;}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{angry, determined, grace tries to swing her leg onto the horse. she can't do it. tears of frustration on her face. she tries again. she manages to pull herself halfway on, her prosthetic leg buckles and she falls. frightened, joe runs to her.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she gasps to catch her breath. he reaches to help her up. she pulls her hand away. embarrassed, she "runs" off. joe remains still. he hears a little voices. he turns and sees the twins having been watching the whole thing from a small hill. as they run off, he yells, threateningly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you better not say anything!!!}
