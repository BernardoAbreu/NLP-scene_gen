<B>__{after a moment of darkness}
<A>__{after a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the loud crashing of fireworks outside the window. sarah sits up, eyes closed. her face feels the warmth coming from the window and she tilts her head toward it. the light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her face. she inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. she goes for the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. she gets to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the sink. she begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully. she dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them in the mirror. a little red, but otherwise fine. she goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and grabs the new champagne bottle. she shakes it violently. juancho wakes. he turns his head to her. his eyes are still closed.}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{are you watching tv?}
<A>__{the champagne bottle explodes. she pours herself a glass.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yep. if you wanna watch too, you have to go wash your face.}
<A>__{juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. he slams into the wall, hard.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{be careful...}
<A>__{juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more cautious. sarah pours herself another glass. she downs the glass and shudders. she smells the bad smell again. only now she really smells it. she smells her feet. nothing. she smells the champagne. nothing. juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. sarah grabs his foot and smells it. she drops his foot. juancho stares blankly at her. sarah looks down at the mattress. she smells the mattress. juancho looks at her as if she's drunk. sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. she takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks toward the mattress. juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back. sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see what is underneath it. juancho screams. sarah is too stunned to scream. stuffed into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse.}
