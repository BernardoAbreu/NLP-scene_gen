<L>__{interior the roof}
<A>__{rose pulls the axe back and swings, and the momentum of the swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery icy roof she falls and starts to slide. just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, charlie climbs down the roof. he stands over her. she's about to slip. her hands are losing strength. her fingers are slipping. the rain is falling harder and harder. charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for life. he leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips. she is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder and harder. charlie now is nowhere near her. he then gets down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the side of the drainpipe to get her. rose looks up helplessly at him. not really asking for his help. not denying it. she's accepted her fate. policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in bunches as charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself hanging on for dear life. he just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. charlie, then with all his strength his "where has this strength been my whole life" strength pulls her up to the roof next to him. several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over to where charlie is detaining rose. the police take her, handcuff her and cart her away. from the corner of the roof appears tony.}

<D>__{thank god. i'm sorry i doubted you, but i thought you were the killer, but you were acting pretty strange?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i thought you were going to leave me, like the others. thank god they were just murdered. i thought they were always leaving me.}
<A>__{below, rose is put into a police car and taken off. the sirens disappear. so do the crowds.}
