<L>__{interior dyson house day}
<A>__{miles dyson sits at the huge desk in his study. he is deep in thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal. next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear. on a sunday morning, when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, dyson is hard at work. in a profile closeup we see him in deep concentration, his mind prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor. a woman's face enters frame soundlessly behind him. he doesn't hear her. his wife, tarissa, extends her tongue and traces it down the back of his neck. he smiles and turns to kiss her good morning. she's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee. he's been up for hours. he turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is standing there. she watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen. we see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box of his world.}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{you going to work all day?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{i'm sorry, baby. this thing is just kicking my ass. i thought we had it with this one...}
<A>__{he points to a metal box on his desk, about two feet long. as assembly of small cubes. it looks like a dinosaur version of terminator's cpu.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{... but the output went to shit after three seconds. i'm thinking now it's the way i'm matrixing the command hierarchies...}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{you need a break. you'll see it clear when you come back.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{i can't}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{miles, it's sunday. you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{oh. i can't, honey. i'm on a roll here.}
<A>__{he takes her hands. we see a childlike excitement in his face. he wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery, the satisfaction of creation.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. it's a neural net process }
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{i know. you told me. it's a neural net processor. it thinks and learns like we do. it's superconducting at room temperature. other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.}
<P>__{(she pulls away from him)}
<D>__{but why is that so goddamn important, miles? i really need to know, 'cause i feel like i'm going crazy here, sometimes.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{i'm sorry, honey, it's just that i'm thiiis close.}
<A>__{he holds up his thumb and index finger... a fraction of an inch apart. she picks up the prototype. it doesn't look like much.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.}
<P>__{(he taps the prototype)}
<D>__{meet the pilot.}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{why did you marry me, miles? why did we have these two children? you don't need us. your heart and your mind are in here.}
<P>__{(she stares at the metal box in her hands)}
<D>__{but it doesn't love you like we do.}
<A>__{he takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down. then he puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently. she acquiesces to his kiss.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{tarissa glances over his shoulder. she nods her head toward the doorway to the study. dyson turns and sees their two kids standing there. danny (6) and blythe (4) look rumpled and adorable in their pjs. dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions.}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{how about spending some time with your other babies?}
<A>__{dyson grins. the forces of darkness have lost this round. he holds out his hands and his kids run to him, cheering.}
