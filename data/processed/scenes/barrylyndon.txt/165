<D>__{ah, roderick, it's a blessing to see that my darling boy has attained a position i always knew was his due, and for which i pinched myself to educate him. little patrick is a darling boy, and you live in great splendor, but how long will it last? your lady wife knows she has a treasure she couldn't have had, had she taken a duke to marry her, but if, one day, she should tire of my wild roderick and his old fashioned irish ways, or if she should die, what future would there be for my son and grandson?}
