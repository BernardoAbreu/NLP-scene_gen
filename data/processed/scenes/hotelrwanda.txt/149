<L>__{exterior hotel pool terrace. day}
<A>__{the pool patio is deserted except for general bizimungu and three soldiers who lounge at a table. gregoire and his girlfriend sun on reclining deck chairs like movie stars. paul and a waiter with a tray of drinks join the general.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{i am glad you are well.}
<A>__{paul hands the scotch to bizimungu.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm sorry it is not glenmorangie.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{as long as it is scotch.}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{your white friends have abandoned you, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the united nations are still here.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<P>__{(laughs) the united nations. madmen are}
<D>__{on the streets, paul. but i will take care of you. (chugs his drink) your cellar is well stocked, right?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, general. i am glad you came by. i overheard something that i think you should know about.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{what did you overhear?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{a discussion between an american embassy official and a un colonel.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{what did they say?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{watch everything? how? they are gone.}
<A>__{paul points surreptitiously to the sky. the general looks up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{satellites.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{satellites?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.}
<C>__{eneral bizimungu}
<D>__{and what will they do with these satellites?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the american said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{the high command? our high command?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. lock them all away forever. no political risk, and big publicity.' that's what he said. (a beat) i thought i'd better tell you.}
<A>__{the general looks again to the sky then.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{the americans! who are they to put us on trial. let us imagine paul when their president kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders `we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.' what do you think would have happened? no different.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{indeed, general. excuse me momentarily.}
