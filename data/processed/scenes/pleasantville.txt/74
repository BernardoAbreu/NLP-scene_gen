<L>__{interior parker kitchen. day.}
<A>__{the women's bridge club has assembled in the parker kitchen like it does every wednesday afternoon. four women are seated around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix between them. betty is sifting next to marge jenkins, the woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(dealing the cards)}
<D>__{... he said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well that makes sense.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{except it's spread to her lips now too. oh, i don't know.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a third woman)}
<D>__{and you say it's just "red?"}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{well like red, only ... "redder."}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hunh. i know what you mean. that's like the front of bill johnson's shop. i was going by it the other day and it looked green only "greener."}
<B>__{shot. betty.}
<A>__{she looks up quickly then grabs some bridge mix.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(lowering her voice)}
<D>__{have you seen him lately? the man doesn't look like himself. i was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. wasn't looking at anything in particular just staring off into space.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that is strange.}
<A>__{betty reaches out and grabs her cards. she fans them out in front of her, when her eyes go wide.}
<B>__{her pov. bridge hand.}
<A>__{they are all hearts and all bright red. it looks like a fistfful of valentines.}
<B>__{close up. betty.}
<A>__{she puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath. betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before lifting them up and taking another look.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{betty, it's your bid.}
<A>__{she swallows trying to keep her composure.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{uh ... seven hearts.}
<A>__{they murmur at the strength of the hand.}
