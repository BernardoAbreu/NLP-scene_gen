<C>__{doolittle}
<D>__{we'll take off late this afternoon. i will hit tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary bombs. you'll come after me at night, guided by the fires. then it's on to china, where you'll arrive at dawn, guided to their airfields by the homing beacons the chinese are going to switch on for us. that's if everything is perfect like every other military mission i've ever been involved with.}
