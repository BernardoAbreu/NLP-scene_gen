<L>__{exterior proximo's school compound night}
<A>__{maximus and juba are being observed. proximo stands in the shadows of the compound and watches intently.}
<L>__{exterior slave wagon provincial streets day}
<A>__{blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back. but the blood is too rich, too red. the oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the crowded streets of the town. hanging above the street is dyed wool drying in the sun. vermilion and crimson dyes drip down and splash across the oxen and splash across the gladiators. maximus, juba, the formidable vibius are chained in the back of the wagon. also the frightened scribe. proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon. proximo has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping dyes. they pass a banner honoring vibius, the star of proximo's stable. meanwhile, the terrified scribe is almost weeping, chattering nervously to vibius, chained next to him:}
<C>__{scribe}
<D>__{i know nothing of armaments and warfare! i'm a scribe i write down words! i can write down seven languages }
<C>__{vibius}
<D>__{be still.}
<C>__{scribe}
<D>__{i don't how do you hold the sword?! i've never held a sword!}
<C>__{vibius}
<D>__{you point the sharp end at your opponent and you shove it in his guts.}
<C>__{scribe}
<D>__{i can't i }
<A>__{he suddenly vomits.}
<C>__{vibius}
<P>__{(calling to proximo)}
<D>__{proximo! you insult me with this carrion! chain him to someone else!}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{don't worry, noble vibius, he won't be bothering you for long.}
<A>__{the scribe begins to weep. the crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators. occasionally throwing trash at them. a pack of children run alongside the wagon, chanting:}
<C>__{children}
<D>__{dead guts! dead guts! dead guts!}
<A>__{maximus watches the children for a moment and then another sight draws his attention. over some buildings he can see vultures circling in the distance.}
