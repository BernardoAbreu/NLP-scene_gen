<L>__{exterior bus depot. day.}
<A>__{row after row of parked buses. truman and marlon exit an administration office. instead of heading for the exit, truman begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the number painted on the rear of each one.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<P>__{(gesturing to the office)}
<D>__{the man told you there's no such bus.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{he's lying. two, four, oh, six was definitely the number.}
<A>__{marlon stops walking. truman continues his inspection. seeing there is no reasoning with him, marlon hurries to catch him up.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i never believed he was dead.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(trying to be patient)}
<D>__{c'mon, truman, a lotta times they don't find a body. you know what the currents are like in that water.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(shudders, a memory flashing in his head)}
<D>__{you had to see his face when that wave hit. he wasn't scared marion. it was like he was expecting it, waiting for it. he knew it was coming.}
<C>__{marlon}
<D>__{why would he fake it?}
<P>__{(trying to make light)}
<D>__{he's not elvis presley.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(ignoring the joke, pondering the morning's events)}
<D>__{you know what was really strange about today? an old woman with a little dog and a businessman, walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork. they force him onto a bus against his will, a bus that doesn't normally stop outside my building. and when i'm giving chase, the bus never makes another stop and i get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure i never catch up with it.}
<C>__{marlon}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars? what are you saying, the entire population of lower manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person? oh yeah, that makes sense.}
<A>__{truman has no answer. we see an aerial shot of truman and marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of buses, marlon still marveling at truman's obstinance. they have come to the last bus in the final row. truman hangs his head. the offending bus is not amongst them. he makes towards the exit without comment and marlon follows. unseen by the pair, we focus on the id number on one of the buses they have previously checked "2400". a single drip of black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.}
