<D>__{i worked for mr. marsh for six years. he was a good man until she came along.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what changed?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{he did. look, i know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough and well...}
<A>__{joanne stops as emotion fills her. her eyes well with tears.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about miss lawson, do you?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i don't know. it's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be rebecca.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i take it you don't like miss lawson very much?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i really don't know her that well. we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house, but that was about it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{if you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that to have the kind of sex they had.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{how do you know what kind of sex they had?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. i'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew. i'd find their little toys all over the place.}

<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{is something wrong.}
<A>__{a beat. dulaney looks at her slowly.}
<C>__{dulaney}
