<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{fans swarm johnny. he signs autographs, poses for pictures. then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch limo. a tinted window rolls down. victor's face emerges.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{need a ride, johnny?}
<L>__{exterior interior limo night}
<A>__{johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous models.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{a few fans. hope you don't mind.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{gotta take care of the fans, right?}
<A>__{he smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{look, i built my business knowing what people want. and right now, the people want you.}
<A>__{johnny eyes the models, all lusting.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{and we don't want to let the people down now, do we?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{no we don't. which is why we need to strike while the iron's hot. i'm talking action figures, videogames, sponsors }
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{videogames? you serious?}
<A>__{victor nods, knowing he has johnny on the hook.}
<C>__{johnny }
<D>__{you talk to reed and sue about this?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{johnny. let's be honest here. ben, reed, sue. good people, all. but stars?}
<P>__{(shaking his head, a beat)}
<D>__{i don't want to break up the band, but you're the one they want. don't you think it's time to go solo...?}
<A>__{victor subtly nods to the models. they envelop johnny.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{take the car for a spin. think about it. is this the life you want? or would you rather live in reed's lab...?}
<A>__{the car stops. victor gets out. he stands on the pavement. as he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto johnny. the door shuts, and... whhhmmmpf! the windows all suddenly steam up!}
