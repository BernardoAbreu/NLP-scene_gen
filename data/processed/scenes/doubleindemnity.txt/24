<A>__{b 47 parking space adjoining glendale station night the station is visible about sixty yards away. there is no parking attendant. ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally, not crowded. the train is not in yet, but there is activity around the station. passengers and their friends, redcaps and baggage men, news vendors, etc. the dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past camera and parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line, several spaces from the next car, facing away from the camera. both front doors are open. phyllis gets out and from the other side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, and apparently dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. while he is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, phyllis has taken out dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. she walks around the car and rolls up the right front window. she closes and locks the car door. she tries the right rear door and takes a last look into the dim interior of the car. then she and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the station platform and along it toward the station building, phyllis walks several steps ahead of the man. b 48 phyllis & the man walking camera following them, a little to one side, so that phyllis is clearly seen but the man's face is not.}
