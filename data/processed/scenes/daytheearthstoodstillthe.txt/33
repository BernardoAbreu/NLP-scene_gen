<A>__{we are at the actual location now, not looking at tv. we see the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. some distance away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by police. prominent in the scene are newsreel and television cameras. our camera moves in to med. shot. as it does so, we see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of the ship. one, which is an oddly designed coil of wire, slides up and revolves slowly. the other is a section of vented pipe with a convex cap on it.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of activity from the ship. they shift uneasily, gripping their rifles more firmly. med. shot the ship after a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. there is an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. he looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. this is klaatu. he is completely human in appearance. the only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. he wears a tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time thoroughly comfortable and practical. on his head is a metal helmet that obscures most of his face. (it would be impossible to identify him later.) the design of this helmet gives the impression that it is more a formal headdress than for protection. klaatu is above all an impressive man a man of tremendous dignity and presence. he has the tolerant superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.}

<A>__{of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. the newsreel and tv men are busy at their cameras. med. close shot klaatu after an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the universal gesture of neutrality. then he speaks, in perfect english, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{we have come to visit you in peace and with good will.}
<A>__{klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. as he does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking object, longish and tubular. it might be a a telescope or it might be some strange kind of weapon.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{shooting from the side, showing klaatu advancing slowly toward the line of soldiers. he holds out the mysterious object in front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering but could be misinterpreted as menacing. there is a growing, uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as klaatu advances. they are clearly frightened of what he may do. close shot platoon leader a young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. as klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader raises his carbine to his shoulder.}
<B>__{med. close shot}
<A>__{of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. he is watching klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and he has drawn his pistol. convinced that the lieutenant is in jeopardy, the tank commander aims at klaatu and fires.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as klaatu falls to the ground wounded. the object he was holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. the soldiers start to gather around klaatu excitedly when suddenly there appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. there is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw back at sight of him. the robot is ten feet tall, is made in the almost perfect image of a man. he is to be played by an actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. his eyes flash as though lighted internally. his perfectly fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. this is gort. there are cries of amazement as gort walks slowly ponderously, down the ramp to the ground. as he does so, the ramp closes behind him. gort's face is, and always remains, utterly expressionless. he stops to look at klaatu, lying on the ground. then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and guns. all the guns have been traversing to follow him. close shot gort from inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as though power were being generated within him. his eyes flash toward the tank from which klaatu was shot. med. close shot tank there is a great metallic clatter and the sherman tank is suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely disintegrated. only a piece of tank track and twisted gun barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what had been there. the tank's crew has remained unharmed. close shot gort the crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in a semicircle taking in all the troops. med. shot the troops shooting from behind gort, with the back of his head in f.g., camera pans to follow gort's sweeping gaze. in a growing crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is destroyed. the two machine guns are little heaps of junk. the 75's are larger heaps. the second tank, like the first, is a three foot pile of scrap. rifles have dropped from the soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of wood and metal. none of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced. another angle the troops as they react to the full shock of what has happened. most of them stand rooted to the ground. several laugh hysterically. a few break and run wildly. med. shot crowd of civilians sudden pandemonium breaks out. utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape. med. close shot gort he is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on klaatu. standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. the robot starts to reach out to grab him. close shot klaatu lying on the ground. he speaks to gort sharply, in a strange language.}

<D>__{gort! deglet ovrosco!}
<A>__{med. close shot gort he pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank commander. dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains that way. med. close shot klaatu he has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. the two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. they are uncertain as to what they should do. the platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to klaatu. with great dignity, klaatu picks up the broken object, which we see well for the first time. it is a delicately made tubular telescope, badly smashed. on it are indications of small electronic gadgets.}

<P>__{(glances at the broken object ruefully)}
<D>__{with this he could have studied life on other planets.}
<A>__{klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. the two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. then klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding his wounded shoulder. as he does so, a colonel and a captain come into scene.}
