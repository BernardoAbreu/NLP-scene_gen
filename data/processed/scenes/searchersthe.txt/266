<A>__{p.o.v. scar he looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. he has a scalping knife in his hand. scar whips his arm back. behind him we see the other comanche the one from the horse herd.}
<L>__{interior tepee full shot}
<A>__{martin spins and his gun is out. he fans the trigger hammer twice and both slugs hit scar. as the other comanche leaps in, martin's gun speaks again. and then he is on his feet, catching debbie by the arm unresisting now and pulling her after him through the camp. shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp.}
