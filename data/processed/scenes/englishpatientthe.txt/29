<L>__{exterior pottery hill. day.}
<B>__{the base of a hill seems composed entirely of pottery jars.}
<A>__{d'agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading madox and almasy. the other members of the team are already there bermann, a german photographer and fouad, egyptologist from cairo.}
<C>__{madox}
<P>__{(to almasy, astonished)}
<D>__{my god, look at this!}
<A>__{they bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, piled on top of each other. bermann approaches them, carrying his tripod.}
<C>__{bermann}
<D>__{incredible, hmm? quite incredible.}
<C>__{d'agostino}
<D>__{i've never seen anything like it. there would have been enough water here to serve an army.}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(gloomily)}
<D>__{which means we're in the wrong place.}
<A>__{almasy speaks with a slight but unmistakable european accent.}
<C>__{d'agostino}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{would you stockpile water near to an oasis? there can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.}
<C>__{fouad}
<D>__{or they didn't know of one.}
<C>__{bermann}
<D>__{so, it may not be zerzura, still incredible.}

<P>__{(nodding, delighted)}

<D>__{a wild goose chase.}
<C>__{madox}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{almasy gives him a look. but madox will have none of it.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{no. now we look in the other places. we're eliminating.}
<A>__{the unmistakable buzz of an aeroplane distracts them.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{good, and here comes reinforcements.}
