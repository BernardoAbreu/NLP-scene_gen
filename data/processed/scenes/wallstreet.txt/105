<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{marv}
<P>__{(looking in the same direction)}
<D>__{lynch is giving him the boot... he's not pulling his quota.}
<A>__{bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look. his pov closer on the glass... dan steeples pleading for his job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them before... just one more chance, mr. lynch... lynch shaking his head...}
<C>__{marv}
<P>__{(reminding him)}
<D>__{...we're all just one trade away from humility, buddy...}
<A>__{dan steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to tears but trying to maintain face... buddy's eyes dart away, not wanting to deal with it. dan steeples walks by his as lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{new research report on gm and a conference call on defense stocks at my office at 11. no rsvp required, just be there. and on an inspiring note i'm pleased to announce the new office record for a single month's gross commission goes to bud fox. who more than doubled the old mark. way to go bud. super job! come on up here.}
