<D>__{you shittin' me? course you pay. dime a piece, two cents for the kids. and inside the tent there's this mouse city made out of boxes and toilet paper rolls...}

<A>__{del tosses the spool extra hard it takes a bad bounce off the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the mile. the mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice: his old enemy percy.}

<D>__{percy, no!}
<A>__{percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on mr. jingles. there's a soft snap as the mouse's back breaks. del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing the mouse's name. percy looks to brutal and paul, smiles.}

<D>__{knew i'd get him sooner or later. just a matter of time, really.}
<A>__{he turns and strolls up the mile, leaving mr. jingles dying in a tiny pool of blood. up at the duty desk, dean and harry get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious. percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. del is still screaming, all his pent up terror and grief pouring out at the dying mouse. and then comes a soft, urgent voice:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{give'm to me.}
<A>__{they turn. coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one massive hand spread open.}
<C>__{coffey}

<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{paul doesn't answer, just lays mr. jingles into coffey's hand. coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. all we see now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh, dear jesus. the tail. look at the tail.}
<A>__{they do. the tail is no longer weak and dying. it's snapping briskly back and forth, as if ready to play. coffey makes that retching gagging sound...and again exhales a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth. the men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and disappear. coffey bends down, opens his hand. mr. jingles bounds off his fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. they turn to see del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying. dean turns back to coffey with a stunned whisper:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what did you do?}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no game. see for yourself.}
<A>__{beat. percy stalks past them, heads out onto the mile. paul and brutal just wait, saying nothing. brutal picks up the rag left by percy, resumes polishing chores on old sparky. paul stretches, cracks his neck. the silence heavy... ...until percy reappears.}

<D>__{no such place. that's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet. just thought you should know, faggot.}
<A>__{the stricken look in del's eyes tells us a part of him had known all along. paul and brutal would both like to deck percy right about now, and he knows it he gives them a "what are you gonna do about it" smile. nothing they can do. paul nods to harry, who takes the black mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over del's head, leaving the top of his shaved head exposed.}
<B>__{percy}
<A>__{takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine. the other don't see it, but we do: percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it. it never touches the water. he straightens up and places the sponge atop delacroix's head, hiding it with his hands. the cap is lowered. paul and the others haven't yet realized what's happened. thunder booms and lightning crashes as percy hides a smile, steps back to address the condemned:}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's dry!}
<A>__{delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs pistoning up and down in his restraints. there's a muffled pop from under the cap, like a pine knot exploding in a hot fire. smoke starts coming through the fabric of the mask, puffing upward. del is being cooked alive. paul spins to the partition, hollering }
