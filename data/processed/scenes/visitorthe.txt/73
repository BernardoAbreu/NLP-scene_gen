<A>__{they pick up the pace. walter puts down his drum to take out his metrocard. tarek quickly picks it up.}
<C>__{tarek }
<D>__{i got your drum. my card is empty. can you swipe me?}
<A>__{walter swipes his card for tarek to pass through and then he swipes his own turnstile. walter passes through. tarek struggles a bit with both drums. he gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks. he's stuck.}
<C>__{tarek }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hey. you paid for the drum and not me. here take this.}
<A>__{walter takes tarek's drum and tarek quickly ducks under the turn style that walter just paid for.}
<C>__{tarek }
<P>__{(re: the train)}
<D>__{i think we missed it. zainab is not going to be happy if...}
<A>__{suddenly a man takes tarek by the arm.}

<A>__{tarek reacts by pulling his arm away.}
<C>__{tarek}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{nypd. could you please step over here?}

<P>__{(to tarek)}
<D>__{can i see some id.}
<A>__{tarek takes out his wallet. he shows them an id card. walter steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. cop #2 stands between him and the action. walter can barely make out what is being said.}

<C>__{tarek}
<D>__{no. cop #1 where are you from?}
<C>__{tarek}
<D>__{syria. why?}
