<L>__{interior grand ballroom, plaza hotel night}
<A>__{a spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the metropolitan museum of art attended by five hundred guests from high society dressed only in black and white. a large band plays everything from waltzes to jazz to swing. chandeliers glisten. guests, sitting in ornate boxes, look down on the marble dance floor where a waltz is in progress. find wills and charlotte, dancing together. charlotte looks sophisticated and beautiful beyond measure, wearing a sleeveless black sheath with a fake fur wrap, and, of course, her hat.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{nonsense. you're very good. where did you learn?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{from ella. the woman whose memorial you crashed.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so you did see me there.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh huh. and the next time i saw you, you were on the cover of new york magazine. and i had to pick a place for my birthday. so...}
<A>__{it takes a few beats for wills to put it together. he smiles, realizing that her presence at elysium wasn't a coincidence. she smiles back, sweetly, coyly. on the perimeter, find two rich women, 40's, too thin, too lifted, watching wills and charlotte waltz. they stand with lisa, 23, unassuming, fair haired, simply dressed.}
<D>__{rich woman #1 of course he moved back. i mean, he'd already seduced every a and b list actress in town. what was left for him?}
<A>__{pause. lisa looks at her, feigning naivety.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{the c list? rich woman #2 exactly. rich woman #1 but if what i hear is true and he's shopping for a bride, i can tell you one thing he's barking up the wrong tree there.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why do you say that? rich woman #1}
<P>__{(with an icy smile)}
<D>__{good wives are rarely found up cherry trees.}
<A>__{the women share a laugh. lisa, slightly discomposed, looks back at wills and charlotte.}
