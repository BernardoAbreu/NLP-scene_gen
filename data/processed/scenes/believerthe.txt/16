<L>__{40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. her name is lina moebius.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{...the day he graduated high school, he'd go see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest's brother in the shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he'd be making $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on sundays in columbus park, and when he died, the whole town'd get drunk and cry over him....}
<A>__{the crowd nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers, unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off duty cops listens quietly. during this, a young woman (carla) appears from the rear of the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and a history book. she glances into the living room.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{...today, when that kid walks down the street it's full of trash and half the faces are black. the shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at burger king. so he drinks, smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his mother. the boy's father won't find out he's dead till six months later.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the soul of this country is being destroyed, and all the government can offer is free trade, mutual funds and ipos.}
<C>__{guy danielsen}
<D>__{you sound like a leftist.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i used to be one.... no, seriously, i called myself an anarchist. i stood up for the oppressed. i opposed state power.}
<C>__{an old coot}
<D>__{don't you still?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i oppose the present state because it's weak. it has been ever since the left emasculated it over vietnam. but i think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the loss of community or real leadership, the personal emptiness he simply cannot fill on his own....}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{that's why i'm a fascist. it's the only form of government that addresses our deepest needs.}
<A>__{silence. danny who has spotted carla begins to clap, a few others join in. danny raises his hand; curtis nods to him....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what do you think the fascism of the twenty first century will look like?}
<A>__{everyone including carla turns to see who asked that.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{more cultural than political.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. we'll see antiabortion, anti immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....}
<A>__{the crowd seems impressed, but restless and bored.}
<C>__{old coot}
<D>__{what about race?}
<A>__{a stirring: many share the concern. lina watches closely.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{this isn't the time for that.}
<A>__{murmurs of surprise, disappointment.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i disagree.}
<P>__{(glances at carla)}
<D>__{i think race is central to everything we're talking about.}
<P>__{(murmurs of agreement)}
<D>__{spiritual life comes from race. from the blood. without that, we're no better than the jews....}
<A>__{the magic word. the whole room comes alive. zampf grimaces.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what's wrong with the jews?}
<C>__{mrs. moebius}
<D>__{carla...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{have you read toynbee? spengler?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{nobody reads that stuff anymore.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{too difficult?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{too christian. you know jameson? paul virilio?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the point is, the modern world is a jewish disease.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{disease? what disease?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{abstraction. they're obsessed with abstraction.}
<A>__{that stops the conversation. but carla is intrigued; here is someone whose mind moves in strange and interesting realms.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{what would you propose?}
<A>__{the questioner is a young man (guy danielsen), better spoken than the others. danny feels all eyes on him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{killing jews.}
<A>__{a tremor of fear and excitement ripples through the room. zampf glances at mrs. moebius; she is watching danny intently.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{that would be a catastrophic mistake.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{people hate jews. do you agree?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{they used to. today it's not an issue.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. the very word makes their skin crawl.}
<P>__{(around the room people nod)}
<D>__{it isn't even hate, really. it's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. we want to step on it. crush it. we don't even know why. it's a physical reaction. everyone feels it.}
<C>__{guy danielsen}
<D>__{which ones would you kill?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{prominent jews. who are either symbols in themselves or who represent aspects of the jewish character people despise.}
<C>__{guy danielsen}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{old coot}
<D>__{barbra streisand.}
<A>__{mutterings: "who's she?" "yeah, her..." but danny says:}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{too obvious.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{kissinger...dershowitz...roseanne...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yes. and larry king...}
<C>__{old coot}
<D>__{is he jewish?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{...leona helmsley, michael eisner, bob dylan, phillip roth, ruth bader ginsberg, steven spielberg, winona ryder, beverly sills, alvin toffler, katherine graham. all of them. but not yet. we don't want celebrity obscuring the issue.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{which is what?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{at first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{you wouldn't announce it?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'd say nothing. after two or three, people will try to find a pattern. a reason.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{but when it comes out, the public will be outraged. it will look like germany all over again.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{isn't that what we want? germany all over again? only done right this time...}
<A>__{the crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill. zampf glances at mrs. moebius....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{without speeches or political parties. a movement without leaders so that no one can stop it...}
<A>__{the room is stunned to silence. mrs. moebius signals curtis.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{okay, let's break this up for now....}
<P>__{(to danny)}
<D>__{could you wait a minute...?}
