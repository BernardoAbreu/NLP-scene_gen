<A>__{a close shot of a yellow legal tablet. a young hand comes into frame, holding a pencil. for a few moments, we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written in a series of dissolves. the hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way. and then the sound of an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we now hear alvin and the chipmunks' "christmas song."}
