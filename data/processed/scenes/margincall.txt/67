<L>__{interior will emerson's convertible day}
<A>__{will and seth are driving slowly towards downtown manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield. there is a long silence, and finally.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so, am i getting fired?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{very long pause, then he looks over at seth and decides whether to tell the truth.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{probably...yes...almost definitely.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{this clearly hits seth but he recovers quickly.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{it's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. nothing i say is gonna make you feel any better.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i get it.}
<A>__{seth looks over at will and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city.}
<D>__{seth (cont'd) (cont'd) when did you know this is what you wanted to do?}
<A>__{he thinks that through.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{the first time i made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{it was a perfect trade...i saw it coming from three days away. i took my time. i was in, i was out...pish posh...and it was beautiful.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how did you learn to do that?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow.}
<A>__{will looks out again at the city then to seth.}
<D>__{will emerson (cont'd) (cont'd) look man i'm sorry about this.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{don't be, you're not doing it to me.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i know...but i'm still sorry. at least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{only if we can get this done, right?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{we'll get it done.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i'm trying to figure that out right now.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{there aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i'm trying to think of every last one of them i can and then i will make them willing.}
<A>__{this line sits there for a minute and will looks out onto the city.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you ok with that?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i'm about to completely fuck guys i've been doing business with for fifteen years so no i'm not exactly ok with it. but look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i guess. and what about everyone else?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{everyone else?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{normal people.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{what are you a socialist? fuck me seth.}
<A>__{will looks over at seth, sizing him up, looking to see if he has what it takes.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{look, if you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary. and you are. if people want to live like this...with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for. then you are necessary. the only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in their favor. and if i were to take my finger off...}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{then the whole world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly. and no one wants that, they say they do...but they don't. they want what we're giving them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it. and that's more hypocrisy than i can swallow. so fuck em.}
<A>__{long look out at the city ahead.}
<C>__{will emerson }
<D>__{and tomorrow if this all goes south they'll crucify us for being reckless, but if we are wrong and everything get's back on track. they'll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that god ever let through the door.}
<A>__{he is trying to convince himself as much as seth. they both look out the windows.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are we gonna be wrong on this one?}
<A>__{will looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above them.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no...they're all gonna get fucked.}
