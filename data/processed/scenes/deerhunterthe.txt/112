<L>__{exterior narrow street after rocket explosion night}
<A>__{a nearby building is burning fiercely. the street is deserted except for the sprawled corpses of the street urchins which lie this way and that, like broken dolls. nick walks out past the corpses. the street is littered with fragments of broken ceramic gleaming, pure white, like chunks of snow.}
<L>__{exterior deserted street saigon night}
<A>__{the sky is alight with fires. now and then huge explosions rock the night and sirens wail. a lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street. as the figure approaches we see that it is nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(toneless, over and over)}
<D>__{hey, hey, the wind does blow. hey, hey, the snow does snow. hey, hey, the rain does rain...}
<A>__{nick swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion. then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{hey, hey, the wind does blow. hey, hey, the snow does snow...}
<A>__{nick takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the photograph of linda and peers at it with a kind of ferocious determination, as if this link were the last, as if by staring at it hard he could make it hold.}
<C>__{nick }
<P>__{(his voice thin, cracking)}
<D>__{hey, hey, the wind does blow. hey, hey, the snow does snow }
<A>__{there is the sharp report of a pistol shot and then, as nick spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the unmistakable sound of applause. nick stares at the building for a long moment, then he crosses toward it.}
