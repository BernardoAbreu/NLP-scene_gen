<A>__{hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes. whale hands a glass of red wine to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{they both take a sip of wine.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{smells lovely, hanna.}
<A>__{hanna nods, steals a glance at clay as she leaves.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{saw your movie the other night. watched it with some friends.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did you now?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i liked it. we all did.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did anyone laugh?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{pity. people are so earnest nowadays.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why? was it supposed to be funny?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i had to make it interesting for myself, you see. a comedy about death. the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.}
<P>__{(a sip of wine)}
<D>__{but the monster never receives any of my gibes. he is noble. noble and misunderstood.}
<A>__{whale gazes pointedly at clay, who eats with his elbows on the table, quickly bolting the hot omelette.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in korea, mr. boone?}
<A>__{clay looks up.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did you kill anyone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't like to talk about that.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. that's something to be proud of.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{proud? any jerk with a gun can kill someone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{quite true. hand to hand combat is the true test. did you ever slay anyone hand to hand?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{no. i could have, though.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, i believe you could.}
<P>__{(a sip of wine)}
<D>__{how free is your schedule this afternoon?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{full up. i got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by la cienega.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what is we say phooey to the hedges? could you spare an hour after lunch? to sit for me?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can't today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i will pay our going rate. plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sorry. i don't feel like sitting still today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{all righty. i understand.}
<A>__{whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at clay.}
