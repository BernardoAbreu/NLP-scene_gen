<ACTION>__{The world turns below us, vast and slow. A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the shadow. We cast the shadow. Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world. No trace of civilization. The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow. They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white. Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black. Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge. They are ENGINEERS. Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design. The third is naked. One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material. The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness. It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament. BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite. Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.}
<TRANS>__{FLASH ON:}

<ACTION>__{...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless. The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a felled tree. Engulfed. The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively. Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky. As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing. Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FOREST - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance. A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain. A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep. Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON THE WOMAN}

<ACTION>__{Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape. An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work. The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat. Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches: we're not in space at all, but deep underwater. The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars" are plankton shining in the floodlights.}

She brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away loose silt and stones. The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps. Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears. In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall. Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:}

The machinery opens like a grotesque biomechanical flower. Releases him. The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed. The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining eyes. The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body. He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates. The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe. The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible. Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room. Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves. Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom. Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him. But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones. DAVID steps forward. Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers. The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation. DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads. The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy. The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -}
<DIAL>__{- and tears DAVID's head off.}
<ACTION>__{A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck. The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off. DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's hiding place. Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder. She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it. The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid. But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms. The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's armored shoulders and head. The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.}

Obscure devices clutched in his fists. Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns. Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god. It seems time slows down. The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes. The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied in the fabric of space itself. The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect. Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later. Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed. Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber. The door begins to close.

But a tiny rattle of metal from the quivering saw brings it back. Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment. The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws. The monster screams and recoils. Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw. The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground, injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury. Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground. Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips. The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her faceplate. Its hideous jaws open. With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt. Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth. The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw. She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade. IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL. A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet. The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw still growling. Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast. With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off as it crumples and melts. She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks around with tearing eyes. In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
