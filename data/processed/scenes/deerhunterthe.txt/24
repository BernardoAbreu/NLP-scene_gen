<L>__{interior nick's trailer day}
<A>__{the place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. a deer head is mounted above the sink and nick, who is half into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy boots. merle smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(indicates the waterproofing)}
<D>__{you should have put that on last night.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{that way it sets.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i just wait. you know?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i just wait. for this... it's what i wait for... i wait all year.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so do i.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{nick grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil off it.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{you think about it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{so do i.}
<P>__{(watches nick for a minute)}
<D>__{i want to be ready... you have to be ready... it has to be there, in your mind.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the shot?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{fucking a.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't think about the shot that much.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{you have to think about the shot. it's the shot. the shot's it.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(uncertain)}
<D>__{yeah... i guess.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(studies him)}
<D>__{what do you think about?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know... i guess i think about the deer... being out, maybe. i don't know. i think about it all. hell, i like the trees, you know? i like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(with a glance to the window)}
<D>__{i will tell you something, nick. i wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. i won't hunt with a yo yo.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yo yo! who's a yo yo?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{who's a yo yo...? who do you think's a yo yo! they're all yo yo's. i mean they're all great guys, for christ's sake, but... the point is, nick, without you i'd hunt alone. seriously. i would. that's what i'd do.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you're a fucking nut. you know that, merle? you're a fucking maniac!}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{when it comes to hunting, that's true.}
<A>__{cursing and banging from outside. nick opens the door. john and albert, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are pounding on the trunk of the cadillac, trying to get it open. nick and merle go out.}
