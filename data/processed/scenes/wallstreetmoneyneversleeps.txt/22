<L>__{exterior 112th street moments later}
<A>__{as gordon and jacob leave the campus and take to the street.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{keller, zabel? then you have my apologies.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{stock's in a free fall. my guess is that it just lost its bar mitzvah...}
<A>__{jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and checks to see gordon's right... kzi... $12.54.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{by the end of the day it might not even be potty trained.}
<A>__{and jacob looks at him.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{i might not be allowed to trade, jake, but i still love to watch from home.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{andrew zabel took me under his wing when i was in high school. he basically got me my scholarship to yale then hired me right out of business school.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{andrew's smart, he beats the benchmarks consistently. he'll land on his feet.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<A>__{and gordon stops walking and regards jacob. who confirms...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{he killed himself this morning.}
<A>__{as that registers...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he was a father to me.}
<B>__{.}
<A>__{and jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{i love your daughter very much and i would be honored if...}
<A>__{and realizing what this is... gordon starts to laugh... which throws jacob off.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{... you would bless i really don't understand what you find so funny.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{my daughter hasn't spoken to me for eleven years and you know it. she blames me for her brother's overdose and every other disaster that's fallen upon the world since the mid nineties.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and by the way, isn't it strange that winnie would date a guy from the street?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{she hates me. and she hates wall street and everything it represents... so don't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you?}
<A>__{and that slams into jacob... who's frozen for a beat. jacob finally snaps out of it then joins gordon.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{so you want my blessing?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i guess i should know a little about you first. where did you grow up?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{matinecock.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i'm impressed.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it wasn't like that. i mean we didn't have much money. my mother was a tailor.}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{and your father... what did he do?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{disappear.}
<A>__{and gordon regards jacob for a long moment, taking him in, until...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{clever.}
<A>__{jacob looks down the street.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{what are you looking for?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{your town car.}
<A>__{with a laugh...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{well, pal...}
<A>__{as gordon pats jacob on the back...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{... then you're going to be looking for quite awhile.}
<A>__{... and heads for the subway.}
