<L>__{interior subway repair car later}
<A>__{we now see the car is 50's vintage. a poster of mickey mantle above an empty worktable. peter sits before susan. she's trembling, understandably shaken from her previous experience. blood pours from a cut on her forehead. peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just keep holding it. can you do that for me?}
<P>__{(no reponse.)}
<D>__{susan?}
<A>__{susan nods silently. her hand weakly presses the compress.}
<C>__{manny }
<D>__{doctor tyler?}
<A>__{he turns to manny, who sits solicitously next to leonard. his wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. he begins to stir. peter gets up, but susan's hand is closed tightly around his, like the jaws of the mimic. he kisses her gently, then slowly manages to release his hand. he walks to leonard, inspects his wound. touches the sole of his foot.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you feel anything?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yeah, i feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{leonard, listen. i need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.}
<P>__{(no response.)}
<D>__{look, i'm trying to help you here...}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm sorry. but i don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.}
<A>__{peter touches his foot again. leonard finally nods. manny gazes at the mimic carcass at the end of the car.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{where the hell'd that thing come from?}
<A>__{peter looks at susan. she remains silent.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{a mistake.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{"mistake"? what's that supposed to...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, all right? it's dead.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{how you know that? shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it doesn't have a heart.}
<A>__{peter looks up at her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{just inner chambers...}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{but it look like a man. it... i saw it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{she gets up, finally moving.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that's what it wanted you to see.}
