<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{the frame is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age. they have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing. they are city cops; they don't have that old fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature the fact is they love their work, which is criminals. there is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious. these are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men. moretti is an old line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the fbi, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. right now they are looking at the sky. we hear a heavy helicopter track. we feature sheldon, the silver haired fbi agent in charge, who looks like an accountant, and moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of warner brothers movies of the forties. in spite of sheldon's age, moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages. the three hang around him. they approach moretti who looks at them without moving.}

<P>__{(to no one)}
<D>__{here comes the fbi.}
<P>__{(to sheldon)}
<D>__{you men lookin' for protection? we got all the police right here.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?}
<A>__{moretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{i made an error in judgment. i thought the sons of bitches would be overwhelmed with remorse at the sight of a police officer. and you know somethin'? nobody has said hostage yet. unnastan?}
<A>__{they are moving past cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank. we now sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not yet knowing what's going on.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{from down the street come a group of odd looking men in suits, carrying all kinds of electric junk: the new reporters. they run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke... they run up to moretti and sheldon, who walk along, trying not to catch an eye. moving shot moretti and sheldon among newsmen.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{how many in the bank? have they got hostages? any shots exchanged?}
<P>__{(etc., ad lib)}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{no, we don't know that yet. this young fella without the hat is fbi. i'm detective sergeant eugene moretti ... m o r e double t i. eugene. i don't give a shit, but my wife cries if you spell it wrong.}
<A>__{they have arrived at the barber shop where moretti fights his way inside.}
