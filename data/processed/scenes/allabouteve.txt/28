<L>__{interior margo's living room night}
<A>__{it's many martinis later. most of the guests have gone. the party has reached that static state everyone's assumed more or less permanent places. birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. camera follows her to the piano where margo sits on the bench beside the pianist. he is just finishing "liebestraum" and she stares moodily into a martini. birdie halts beside her with the coffee. margo looks up. birdie holds out the coffee. margo takes the onion out of the martini, drops it into the coffee and waves birdie away. birdie goes. "liebestraum" comes to an end. the pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated rhythm. margo stops him.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{"liebestraum."}
<C>__{pianist}
<D>__{i just played it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{play it again.}
<C>__{pianist}
<D>__{but that was the fourth straight time.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{then this will be five. i suppose you think i'm too drunk to count.}
<C>__{pianist}
<D>__{no. you're just crazy about "liebestraum."}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{"liebestraum."}
<C>__{pianist}
<D>__{look, miss channing... it's kind of depressing. if you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{my dear horowitz. in the first place, i'm paying you union scale. second, it's my piano. third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "liebestraum."}
<A>__{unhappily, he plays "liebestraum." margo sips her martini, stares down into it again. bill tiptoes up.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. where has it been laid out?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(somberly)}
<D>__{it hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. as a matter of fact, you're looking at it. the remains of margo channing. sitting up. it is my last wish to be buried sitting up.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(trying to kid her out of it)}
<D>__{wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the shall we say, happier side?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{if my guests do not like it here, i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i'm sure you will all feel more at home.}
<A>__{bill is about to get mad when max bustles up.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{margo. you by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{poor max. heartburn?}
<P>__{(max nods)}
<D>__{it's that miss caswell. i don't know why she doesn't give addison heartburn.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no heart to burn.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{everybody has a heart except some people.}
<P>__{(she finishes her drink, stands up)}
<D>__{of course i've got bicarb. there's a box in the pantry. we'll put your name on it. max fabian. it'll say there. always. just for you.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. it's friends that count. and i got friends.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i love you, max. i really mean it. i love you. come to the pantry.}
<A>__{she takes off. max waits to set bill straight.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{she loves me like a father. also, she's loaded.}
<A>__{he starts off after margo. as the camera pans with bill we see margo going into the pantry with max following her. bill joins addison and miss caswell on the stairs.}
