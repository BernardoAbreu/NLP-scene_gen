<L>__{exterior tatooine desert wasteland day}
<A>__{a death white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. the tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, luke skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. his shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize winning smile. a light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. he is aided by a beatup tread robot with six claw arms. the little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. a bright sparkle in the morning sky catches luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. he stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired landspeeder (an auto like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field). he motions for the tiny robot to follow him.}

<D>__{hurry up! come with me! what are you waiting for?! get in gear!}
<A>__{the robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every jointerior luke throws his arms up in disgust. exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.}
