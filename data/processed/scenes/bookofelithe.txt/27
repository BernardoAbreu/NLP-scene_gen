<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom day}
<A>__{carnegie has claudia pinned against the wall, his pants bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at her. not making love. this is mechanical, loveless sex. claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as carnegie thrusts into her again and again. deeply uninterested, just waiting for it to be over. suddenly, we hear a crash o.s. carnegie stops and listens.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{did you hear that? what was that?}
<A>__{claudia sees an opening to get out of this.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{maybe you should go check.}
<A>__{beat. carnegie keeps listening. then comes another crash.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what in the hell is going on?}
<A>__{he pulls up his pants, grabbing a rifle propped by the door as he rushes out. claudia just stands there for a moment, then reaches down and pulls up her panties. she moves from the wall and makes her way across the room, feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness. only now do we finally realize that she is blind.}
