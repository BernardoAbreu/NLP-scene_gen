<P>__{(buster grins)}

<D>__{happy to be alive, under any circumstances is that your point?}
<A>__{buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. he is up on the road again in a few seconds.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{happy to be alive... i guess so.}
<A>__{they are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. the fast car is driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the army air corps a young officer. from the passenger seat, a beautiful young woman smiles at them, rendering them speechless.}
