<L>__{interior city auditorium, atlanta ali + quarry night}
<A>__{we've entered mid fight in the second round. we're very close. quarry has ali against the ropes. ali pushes him off. quarry comes in again. ali dances, feints and catches quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going backwards!}
<B>__{quarry}
<A>__{shakes it off. reorganizes. throws two jabs, a right to the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook. ali ties him up. the ref separates them. quarry comes in again. ali throws a left cross over quarry's right, which ali leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the same spot. and ali opens a cut. the bell sounds, ending round two.}
<B>__{crowd}
<A>__{goes nuts, that part that's pro ali: atlanta's black elite and scattered whites. and the thunderous noise becomes one sound, one momentum, cheering their warrior saint, their defiant champion's return. and their roar becomes thunder...a momentum unto its own, driving... ali's corner: ali can't wait for the bell to ring. he sucks in a huge breath through his nose and blows it out. angelo applies vaseline.}
<C>__{bundini}
<D>__{you the man! you superman! ain't no kryptonite in this ring tonight!}
<A>__{the bell sounds round three.}
