<L>__{interior the nelson kitchen evening}
<A>__{not a hair above middle class. home sweet home nonetheless. dinner in progress. mom, dad, ted, younger brother, jimmy. a mutt named corky curled under the table. a storm brews. lightning in the distance. thunder rumbles. ted's mom observes her son with unmistakable mom radar. she slides a slab of rotten timing! meat loaf onto his plate with an unpleasant thud. ted shudders...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if i never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon.}
<A>__{ted's mom frowns. jimmy explains matter of factly.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{mom, dad. meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. he's what you'd call clinically bummed.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil? i mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!}
<A>__{ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. his dad gently explains...}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we heard about christy, son.}
<A>__{jimmy tries to stifle a grin.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what is this? does everybody know everything i'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{no cursing in this house, young man. use the strong vocabulary god gave you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we understand your disappointment, teddy. christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...}
<P>__{(catches himself)}
<D>__{we...uh...we understand your disappointment.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's my private business! mine!}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{can the tantrum, sweet pea. we're the good guys, remember?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{mom, dad. don't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow. ted's just experiencing some post adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole "small town dynamic."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i hate xenia! i hate my life!}
<A>__{ted charges for the front door...}
<D>__{ted (v.o.) (cont'd) and until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years. and then it happened. three, two, one...}
