<A>__{camera shoots towards the closed door of susan's room. hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door. he begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly preparing to go to bed. as an after thought, he comes back to the door, addresses it:}

<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{susie?}
<P>__{(getting no answer)}
<D>__{are you in bed...?}
<A>__{camera moves closer. it is at a low level, still emphasizing the man's dignity. he strolls for a few paces.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i don't have to tell you, of course, that i cleared your boyfriend's name; i didn't let you down...}
<A>__{camera has now moved so that we are shooting past hunsecker onto susan's door. he gets no answer except silence.}

<D>__{...i was saving this news for breakfast, but i think i will jump the gun! i'm gonna give you and dallas the biggest wedding this town has ever seen!}
<A>__{still no answer from inside the bedroom. hunsecker's forced expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face. he calls out:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{susie...?}
