<A>__{boom! a firework explodes into the night sky high above hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. tilt down: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party goers 144 hobbits, feasting and drinking carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff... bilbo is greeting visitors. frodo and sam sit at a table drinking ale...frodo notices sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty hobbit, rosie cotton, sitting some distance away.}

<D>__{go on, sam, ask rosie for a dance.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{i think i will just have myself another ale.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{oh, no you don't. go on.}
<A>__{sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. angle on: sam's horrified face as he is swept away. frodo laughs and finishes sam's beer.}
