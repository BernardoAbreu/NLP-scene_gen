<L>__{interior state theater night}
<A>__{a ring set up on stage. men hang out on the side. where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the theatre to the bar. rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced. everyone in here is black except for glenn and white boy bob who sit at a table in the front row while maurice in a dude black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along the apron of the stage.}
