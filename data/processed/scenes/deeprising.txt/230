<A>__{canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked eyes watch a tentacle slowly squirm across the hood toward him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. canton backs away from it as far as he can. another tentacle squirms up next to him. canton crawls away from that one. its feelers and suckers unsheathe, dripping mucus. canton's eyes widen, horrified. then another tentacle squirms up. canton crawls to the center of the hood. and another tentacle. canton has nowhere to go. the tentacles close in on him.}
