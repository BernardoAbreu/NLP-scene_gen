<L>__{98 full shot on the p.b.r.}
<A>__{the p.b.r. along the river shallows the chief and crew waiting and yelling.}
<L>__{99 med. view on willard and lance}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{are you finished surfing?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{yeah... thanks.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{want to say goodbye to the colonel?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{nah.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{then let's get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{they break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance. our view tracks with them. they are cheered by the crew suddenly, willard sees some thing and stops... lance continuing. in a pile of equipment that the hueys have left are two surfboards willard looks at them.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{no no, captain.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{which one's the colonel's?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{the yater the clear one with the thin stringer.}
<A>__{willard glances over to it with determination. there is still mortar fire coming in between him and the board. suddenly, willard makes a run for it.}
<C>__{chief }
<D>__{incoming ! incoming son of a bitch.}
<A>__{the rounds bracket the p.b.r. and line up the beach toward willard. he stands there and doesn't move, the surfboard under his arm. the shells kick up sand. lance has dropped. fragments whistle by, one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{this one , lance?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{yeah, jesus christ !}
<A>__{once again, willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm. lance follows toward the boat, through the water. willard hands the board up to mr. clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and relieved.}
<C>__{clean}
<D>__{what'd you that for?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{when i was a kid i, never had a yater spoon.}
<A>__{mr. clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 cal. mount. the boat turns engines running hard and roars off toward the deeper water of the river the board clearly visible on the stern.}
