<L>__{interior damaskino's lair bathhouse day}
<A>__{we are in a previously unseen portion of damaskino's vast bedroom. an elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned off by a series of latticed screens. in the counterpoint to this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the world cnn, msnbc, c span, etc. damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes flicking over the monitors tracking current events, market fluctuations. we get the sense that the man is a true polymath. that he owes his five thousand plus years of existence to resourcefulness rather than luck. stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.}

<D>__{yes?}

<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{they've made contact with the reapers.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{any casualties?}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{two so far.}
<A>__{unconcerned, damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<P>__{(reverting to english)}
<D>__{an inevitability, i suppose. nyssa was not among them, i trust.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{no. this is a dangerous game, you're playing, damaskinos.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{any game worthy of being played is. one must be patient. in this way, i have outlived my enemies. all of them.}
<A>__{damaskinos steps beyond the screens now, into the pool area and although we can't see the water from this angle, we can see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls. stevens follows, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{blade's too volatile. you're not going to be able to keep manipulating him }
<A>__{damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid, which we now see is blood. his robe spreads out, floating on the surface.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{you worry too much, stevens. i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{as scripted? you've already lost two of your own. how many more are you willing to sacrifice?}
<A>__{damaskinos sinks until he's waist deep in the crimson fluid.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{as many as it takes.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{do you see that jar over there?}
<A>__{stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal coptic jar rests. a human heart floats within.}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<D>__{it contains my human heart }
<P>__{(touching a pale scar on his chest)}
<D>__{something i relinquished a long time ago. only a fool would appeal to it now.}
