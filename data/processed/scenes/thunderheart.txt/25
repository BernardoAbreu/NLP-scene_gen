<L>__{exterior badlands day}
<A>__{a motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. we've seen the ancient bike before. ray walks past it, looking at it. he pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks down into the moonscape. walter crow horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel tracking", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them. he doesn't even look up at the sound of the fbi agent's footsteps.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ray little weasel. fbi. i like the way ya sneaked up on me. must be indian.}
<A>__{the wind whistles and moans through the badlands as crow horse continues feel tracking.}

<D>__{hey, you, listen up }
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ leo wasn't killed here. he was dumped here. out of a vehicle. bald tread. muffler held on with baling wire.}
<A>__{crow horse checks out another track.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{the man you want... stepped outta the car, dragged leo out, laid him down. then walked over here and made a circle in the earth with a stick. i can't find the stick. he stuck an eagle plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see. he got in his car and went hell bent for holy sunday outta here. he ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat, in the little bear river, it floated down to thundershield gap. the car hit paved road, and was outta here.}
<A>__{crow horse rises, points down the road.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{the killin' was done where leo's mother lives. but he was driven here into these badlands.}
<A>__{ray is frowning at the big indian, trying to get a fix on this}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{big sonuvabuck. based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... i'd say he goes two ten, two fifteen }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ well, maybe two seventeen.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{no. not just a track. you gotta listen to the trees, man. to the leaves. to this sand, you fbi's kicked all up. you gotta listen to the earth.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is that right? well, listen to this: drag your ass. this is a restricted area.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{no, this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dog fucker who killed leo. whether you get him or i get him, i just want him. shit's been goin' on too long.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you've got no jurisdiction.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you got no know how. about indian way. or about jack shit for that matter.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{maybe you're not aware of this, crow horse, but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, dna fingerprinting; i don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. leo was killed right here.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{go back to the m.e., take a look inside leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. trust me, there ain't chickens in the badlands. his mother's place is }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ his mother never lived here. she was from up in north dakota.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i'm talkin' his spiritual mother. maisy blue legs.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{his spiritual mother...}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{to us indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. i've got seven mothers on this reservation. sisters. brothers. you ain't one of them.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{thank god. now listen to me, asshole. i'm giving you a break. but if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{easy. easy... i'm goin'.}
<A>__{crow horse walks back up toward the road. ray lets him leave then crouches where crow horse was, begins looking at tracks.}
<C>__{crow horse }
<D>__{hey, little weasel.}
<A>__{ray turns, and sees crow horse perched on a high bank the one ray came down and he's in a tracking stance.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you weigh one sixty three, yeah? not a beer drinker. you're one of these tofu and pilaf characters. pack your gun, under your coat left shoulder. but you got backup; a little .32, .38 maybe, in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag, shoes are too tight at the toe but, man, they look cool. and that's what counts.}
<A>__{ray just stands frozen, blown away. crow horse rises, dusting off his hands, and heading to his vehicle.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{crow horse.}
<A>__{the indian turns. the wind moans. ray scrutinizes him, deliberating.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{crow horse grins and waves, and ambles away. down in}
<B>__{the badlands}
<A>__{ray stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if he's amazed or pissed off.}
