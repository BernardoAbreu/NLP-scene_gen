<A>__{the sign bearing the name of the town reads: "pottersville." george looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. as he goes, camera moves with him. the character of the place has completely changed. where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. we see a series of shots of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz music issuing from the majority of them. the motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on.}
