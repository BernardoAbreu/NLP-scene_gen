<A>__{danny has taken off his coat (revealing a black t shirt with a red swastika), and is going through a number of cardboard boxes marked "d," pulling out comic books, baseball gloves, martial arts gear, drawings of voluptuous women, morbid gothic figures, gun magazines, books about hitler, nazis...and finally a .22 automatic stuffed in a blue sock.}

<A>__{he removes the clip, checks the slide, while nodding to the music coming through his earphones. he looks up, sees linda at the foot of the stairs, pulls off the headset.}

<D>__{i knocked, you didn't answer.}
<A>__{it's too late to conceal the gun; he places it beside him. she does her best to ignore the swastika shirt....}

<D>__{he doesn't want me around.}
<A>__{she looks down as if that were not true, or the way in which it is too complicated to go into.}
