<A>__{alight clicks on revealing an old, '20's built bathroom. the toilet is beside the bathtub shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat. tod puts the lid down and unsnaps his jeans. as he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, camera moves to the curtains... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. camera follows the wind as it continues into the room, rippling across shower curtains. as the breeze passes tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. he moves to close the window, however, camera continues as the air makes its way to the door. the door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.}
