<A>__{anna and mary, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs. anna holds a business card.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it is impossible not to like this guy. i'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside eddie's, and then he tells me he's married. you'd think i'd be pissed, but i literally could not stop myself from liking him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but he's married.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i realize that. i keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off. what is my problem?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ok. there was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business. married for fifteen years to a nice lady. and then he meets this woman at some church event. and he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before. i mean, he had finally met the love of his life. so, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy. i mean, what if you meet the love of your life but you already married someone else? are you supposed to pass them by?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're right. i'm calling him.}
<A>__{anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a private corner, and dials her cell phone.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{hey, ben. this is anna marks.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{hey, anna. what's up?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, i was just taking you up on your offer. you said you might know someone who could help me out and i thought we could discuss it over coffee?}
<A>__{anna waits for a response. on the other end she hears some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{look, i just...i can't anna. you seem great. it's just i don't know. i should go. take care.}
<A>__{anna takes this in stunned. she hangs up. her eyes sting. she can't face mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and holds back the tears. finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again.}
