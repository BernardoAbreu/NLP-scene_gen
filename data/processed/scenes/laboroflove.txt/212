<L>__{interior caldwell kitchen night}
<A>__{the caldwell family dinner... all twelve of them. ten children talk and reach for food. maurice sits at the end talking, enjoying and sharing. isaac sits next to him proudly. maurice has blended in as another member of this family.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior caldwell guest bedroom night}
<A>__{an inviting room. the kind prepared for visiting grandmothers and grandfathers to stay in. maurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowed pajamas fit nicely. he moves to the window and stares at the moon lit landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing. the rocking chair creaks as maurice melts into it. he rubs his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face. his head leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep. the sound of tiny footsteps stirs him. he looks to the doorway to find isaac standing quietly at the door in his baseball p.j.s.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i thought you were asleep.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{you know what... i remembered you were here and i woke up.}
<A>__{isaac walks silently to maurice... tip toeing all the way.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{your parents would want you to be in bed.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{you tell stories?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{oh no... i'm not good at that. very bad in fact...}
<A>__{too late. isaac climbs up into maurice's lap with great effort. maurice looks down at isaac who waits patiently for him to begin.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i would be exceedingly boring.}
<A>__{isaac waits.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i don't do these type of things.}
<A>__{isaac still waiting.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{see there are two kinds of people in this world.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... just a short one okay?}
<A>__{isaac gets in position, cradled in maurice's arms. maurice searches for something to say.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself waiting... he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{you know what... maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{who's telling this story?}
<A>__{isaac points to maurice.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{good, now the team had this great big player big billy. he was the best. he had them in the world super bowl championship of little kids baseball. but right before the game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store... when that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison where he belongs.}
<A>__{isaac didn't understand that last part.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{anyway, big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'who can play baseball?' and there was a little voice that yelled out, 'me, i can play.' everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.}
<C>__{isaac}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{right. but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed... but not big billy. he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. it came to the end of the game. it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{nine.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{okay nine. big billy's team was losing and he was on base. that's when isaac came up. he could barely hold the bat... big billy winked at isaac... the ball was pitched isaac hit the ball hard. it soared up and out over the stadium. everyone cheered. isaac hit a home run and won the game. after the game, isaac asked big billy why he let he play. big billy smiled and said, i wasn't always big billy, i was little billy first... isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. the end.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{you know what that was a really good story... tell it again.}
<A>__{maurice has to smile as isaac looks up anxiously.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{there was a boy named isaac who liked to play baseball...}
<A>__{we back out as maurice rocks back and forth in his chair. isaac falling asleep in his arms.}
