<L>__{exterior estate road day}
<A>__{annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. thirty yards behind her a golf cart drives off a meadow and lands on the road. sebastian is driving. annette looks back and scowls. sebastian catches up to her.}

<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.}

<D>__{i said i was sorry.}
<A>__{she continues her jog. sebastian follows alongside.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{have a nice sleep last night?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{it was fine.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i wish i could say the same for myself. i was up thinking about you all night.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yes, well unfortunately i can't just switch the "on" button to "off." the sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.}
<A>__{annette stops running and turns to him.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{and that's a bad thing?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i'm not here to be your savior.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{well try this one on for size. i think i'm falling in love with you.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{you don't even know me.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't you believe in love at first sight?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{yes, but only when it's mutual. and this is far from mutual.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{ouch. do you think we could spend some time together this morning?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i can't. i'm seeing a friend.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{that's none of your business.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how about tonight?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i'm busy.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{that's also none of your business.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{tell me what to do, annette. how can i win your heart. i will do anything. i can't get you out of my mind.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{you truly want to do something to make me happy?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{and you promise to abide by it?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{without question.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{if that's a problem, then i will make arrangements to stay with some friends.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i will leave this afternoon. happy?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{it's not about being happy. you and i can't }
