<B>__{next morning}
<A>__{roy and sara. barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear. a pop tart grows cold on sara's lap. then, finally.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i can take the school bus. tomorrow.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{school bus? that's the other oz, dorothy. patterson kids ride the city metro. or walk.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{well, i know how to do both.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{not around here you don't. not until you get the hang of things.}
<A>__{sara looks out the window at a full fledged ghetto. it's all to obvious, the hang of things. roy glances over at her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i called about your transcripts. you're all set. patterson's got a pretty good humanities program. no ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school }
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{ i don't think i will have time. i have to study, i will be busy.}
<A>__{roy can hear the lie behind her words. the pain too. he lights a cigarette, cracks the window. he wants to say the right thing.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{good idea. take a break. not too long a break though. you're a dancer. you should dance. stay on top of your art.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{like you stay on top of yours?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{maybe i ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but i'm playing.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{i didn't mean it like that.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{s'alright. hell, i wish i had half the time i wasted gettin' wasted. but those days are over. you'll see. i got my life on track.}
