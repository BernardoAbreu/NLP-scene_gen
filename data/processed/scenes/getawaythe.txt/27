<B>__{they enter the bedroom and sit side by side on the double}
<A>__{bed. they both sit rigidly. doc's eyes are on carol, she stares vacantly expectant. doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness... carol pulls her shoulders back helping doc drop the garment down to her waist. doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her hair... he kisses her... doc gently eases himself away from carol.}

<D>__{oh christ...}
<A>__{he again moves close... doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as carol places both of her arms around him, holding him tightly... doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains unyielding... he closes his eyes for a second... the pressure of the moment is again too intense for doc. once more he pulls gently away from her. carol looks at him, her eyes very reassuring.}

<C>__{doc}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{carol}
