<L>__{exterior dead end night}
<A>__{valjean and cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses. they follow it round a corner to find a dead end. a high wall before them. they're trapped. valjean looks round. no way out. then he sees a nearby lamp bracket. hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower the oil lamp for lighting. he tears off the rope and ties one end round cosette, beneath her armpits. then holding the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to brace himself as he rises. once on the top, he hauls cosette up by the rope. only then does he turn to look down onto the other side. a cloister. a building in the middle, windows glowing. grave stones black against the white snow. the sound of women's voices, singing a psalm.}

<A>__{valjean lowers cosette down into the garden, and drops down after her. javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.}
