<A>__{a grunge dude blasts his car stereo as he enters the tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him. he slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead. closer, he sees dean waving him down. he slows more. bad move. brill opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his pistol at the grunge dude's face. dean leaps in front.}
