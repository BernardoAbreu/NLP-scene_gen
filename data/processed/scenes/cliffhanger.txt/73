<A>__{gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up this'd be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except }
<B>__{the chimney}
<A>__{ there's nowhere to pull back to. there's about two inches of clearance between gabe's chest and the rock, and about the same between his back and the rock. to the right, there is no light. at all. to the left, there's no light. even above, there is no light, because the crack isn't straight nature isn't that obliging it zig zags up. gabe is well within the mountain rock. nothing could be closer to being buried alive gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up he takes out his penlight and turns it on gabe's pov inside the crack around him even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right gabe's face is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that he's made a big mistake.}

<D>__{i didn't need to see that. i really didn't.}
<A>__{gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark.}
