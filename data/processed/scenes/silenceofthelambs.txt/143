<L>__{interior courthouse ground floor lobby night}
<A>__{the bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then indicates a stop there, at the top floor.}
<B>__{favoring sgt. tate}
<A>__{at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. another cop, jacobs, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in the lobby.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<D>__{what is this shit...? did somebody go up to five?}
<P>__{(jacobs shakes his head)}
<D>__{call pembry, ask him what }
<A>__{a gunshot, and then, moments later, two more quick ones, echo down the nearby stairwell. sgt. tate jumps to his feet, grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and noisy.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{cp, shots fired on five! repeat, shots fires on five! outside posts look sharp, we've got a... ho ly shit.}
<B>__{the bronze arrow}

<B>__{back on sgt. tate}
<A>__{as he reacts. the other cops, behind him, are now in a full uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}

<D>__{it stopped!}
<B>__{the bronze arrow}
<A>__{has, indeed, frozen at 3. sgt. tate lifts the microphone again.}
<C>__{sgt. tate}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{seal off a ten block radius. get me the swat team and an ambulance, double quick. we're going up.}
