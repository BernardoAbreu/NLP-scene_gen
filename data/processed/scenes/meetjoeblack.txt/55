<L>__{interior board room, parrish communications day}
<A>__{parrish and joe enter, the entire board is assembled, includ ing drew, quince and sloane.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{an odd mixture of responses, the board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for parrish, a prob lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, bill?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't think so. do you?}
<A>__{drew gets the message, at the same time joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{to get to the point, we have re ceived new information from john bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you.}
<A>__{a moment as parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{bontecou wants a quick response and }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{the answer is no, quick enough for you?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't you want to hear the details?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm not interested in the details. and i'm not interested in the big picture either. what i am inter ersted in is how my board got conven ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and i am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. no, thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so i am to understand from your re sponse that you do not want to hear the details of bontecou's offer?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, you are to understand that, and now may i ask you a question?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{certainly, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{are you running this board or am i?}
<A>__{sloane leans in.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{we're not getting anywhere here. why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{bontecou wants a speedier response than that.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{he'll wait }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{doesn't need to. today, tomorrow, a week from now 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now the answer is going to be the same a loud, unmistakable, all inclusive, airtight 'no'.}
<A>__{a buzz amongst the board, they finally rustle into silence under parrish's withering glance.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{that's it? i've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind. shall we adjourn?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the board would like a response to, a far simpler one.}
<A>__{parrish waits.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{who is the man sitting to the right of you?}
<A>__{everybody's eyes are on joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i've already introduced mr. black to you all.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{but who is he? what are his creden tials? what is his relationship to you?}
<A>__{no response from parrish.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the feeling of the board is this: we fear mr. black is not only influenc ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you.}
<A>__{quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as parrish regards drew, but still does not answer.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the lack of response, bill, is not appropriate. we are your board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you.}
<A>__{parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{okay, one more time.}
<A>__{drew regards joe.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{who is joe black?}
<A>__{parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as quince's head sinks into his hands.}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{a motion has been brought before the board to invoke article 19 of the corporate charter.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{in english, please.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{mandatory retirement upon our chairman's sixty fifth birthday.}
<A>__{parrish is expressionless.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{at which time, the chairman will be named emeritus, he will be welcome to attend all meetings, and will serve as international spokesman for the corporation plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground.}
<A>__{drew pauses.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{please indicate your vote by a "yes" or "no".}
<A>__{a "yes" is heard, now another "yes", now more "yes"es, all reluctant, "no" from sloane, "no" from quince who realizes he is the instrument of parrish's dismissal.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the motion is passed. we will of course delay the announcement, out of respect for our former chairman, until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you for allowing me to save face, drew.}
<A>__{joe's eyes are riveted on drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{the other motion before us is the acceptance of john bontecou's offer to merge this corporation with bontecou international }
<A>__{parrish stands, drew stops speaking.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe?}
<A>__{silence, then joe rises.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{who i am, and my relationship to bill, will be divulged in our own good time.}
<A>__{joe follows parrish out of the room.}
