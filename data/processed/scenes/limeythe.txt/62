<A>__{valentine mingling, all smiles and movement.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{at the foot of the stairs. watches him, all stillness and intensity.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{catches wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double take, then moves on.}
<L>__{interior valentine's house. upstairs hallway. afternoon.}
<A>__{adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads for the stairwell.}
<L>__{interior valentine's house. downstairs. afternoon.}
<A>__{adhara descends the stairs.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{turning to see her as she comes down.}
<B>__{adhara}

<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{hey, i thought you weren't a buffet person.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i'm a gracious host.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{watching them, when }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{wilson looks at him. reluctantly.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{don't you work with ian?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{ian?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{sorry. wasn't me.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{unless i'm not who i think i am.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that's too bad. ian's got a good thing going over there.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{turned that place completely around. degrees.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what i like about ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what i'm saying?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{right. chain of respect. that's good, that.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yeah. i really admire the guy. well. good to meet you.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah. cheers, mate.}
<A>__{the guy leaves. wilson sees that adhara is now on the other side of the room, separated from valentine. he heads for her.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his attention. he notices:}
<B>__{wilson and adhara}
<A>__{talking in a corner. she seems attentive.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{in a series of cuts, still being the gracious host, still keeping his eyes on:}
<B>__{wilson and adhara}
<A>__{who, in a series of cuts, continue to talk. finally, they separate, wilson heading outside onto a deck.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her.}
<B>__{adhara}
<A>__{valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low. after a few moments of conversation, they both look toward:}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{on the deck outside. joining ed, who's taken refuge out here with a plate of food. what wilson can't belleve when he sees it is that behind valentine's house, which is on top of a high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon. on the other side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.}
<C>__{wilson }
<P>__{(jumps back with only slightly affected vertigo)}
<D>__{flipping heck.}
<A>__{ed, a little more accustomed to l.a. architecture, nods in agreement.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{if you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this.}
<A>__{wilson edges forward to the rail again.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{what are we standing on?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{faith.}
<A>__{they stand there looking out. quite a view once you get used to it. breeze.}
<C>__{ed }
<P>__{(nods to the hazy distance)}
<D>__{you could see the sea from here if you could see it.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{could you?}
<A>__{but now ed gives wilson a nudge seeing that valentine inside the house is making his way out here.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage. look about for a toolbox while you're at it.}
<A>__{ed considers. his is not to reason why.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{ed moves off. valentine steps up, smile fully loaded.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{hi. terry valentine.}
<A>__{he extends his hand. wilson shakes it.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{pleasure.}
<C>__{valentine}

<D>__{you must know ian.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{great bloke. really turned things around there. 180 degrees.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{oh, i think a shake up was in order. definitely. otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? forgetful. start thinking they can get away with things. gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.}
<A>__{wilson looks at him. valentine looks back. something about those eyes ...}
<C>__{excited guy}
<D>__{terry, terry ...}
