<A>__{the space is larger than the switchroom. the walls and ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency. manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits. something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half light. a rustling behind him. manny turns around.}
<C>__{manny}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{nino...}
<A>__{he swings the light onto chuy, sitting on the floor before the remains of a rusty column. that beautiful, emotionless smile on his pale face.}

<C>__{manny}
<D>__{nino, please...}
<A>__{manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture of "come to me". in the darkness, something that looks like a palm frond floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see saw gestures as it falls through the air. manny shines his flashlight on the floor. it's not a palm frond. it's a wing. manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls. the place is covered with mimics. they are in the middle of a vicious mating ritual. the males tear savagely at the females wings as they proceed to mount them. a chaotic clusterfuck. manny is sickened. chuy giggles. manny shines his light ahead. manny's face falls.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{dios mio...}
<A>__{the white pillar behind chuy is moving... ...unfolding... ...at last revealing... an albino mimic! another leap for evolution... its form is different from the other mimics. sleeker, more supple, almost beautiful. and while its movements are still not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to them that at the very least entrance us. the thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny boy. it stands over him like a king over his court fool. chuy giggles happily. it's all a game to him. the albino clicks in response a long, leisurely sound, as if trying to communicate with the boy. chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a perfect imitation of the sound. manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with huge, expressionless 'eyes'. he turns to chuy }
