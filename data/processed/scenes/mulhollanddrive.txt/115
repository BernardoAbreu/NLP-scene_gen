<A>__{back to scene diane finishes pouring rita's cup and smiles at betty.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you're welcome. will that be all? you want your check?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just the coffee. rita, you want something?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(still staring at the nameplate thinking)}
<D>__{no. just the coffee.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we'll take our check.}
<A>__{diane searches through her many checks to find betty and rita's. the manager of denny's, standing with a woman in a blue dress, calls diane's name. diane turns and looks to the manager and the woman. a fleeting fear goes through her eyes. she surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes out a mont blanc fountain pen which she puts under betty's check as she places it on their table. she does this very quickly but betty notices this and diane notices betty noticing. diane walks quickly over to the manager and the woman in the blue dress. betty turns and watches a heated conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then leaving. the manager says something to diane and diane turns her pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the manager showing him her innocence. he waves her off and she goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. betty stops watching and turns her attention to rita, who is tense and lost in a thought.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{what is it rita?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(without moving a muscle)}
<D>__{shhhh.}
<A>__{at that moment diane the waitress reappears at their table. diane looks betty in the eye and while looking at betty her left hand slides the mont blanc out from under the check and back into her pocket.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{thank you. come in again.}
<A>__{betty holds her gaze.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're welcome. we will.}
<A>__{relieved diane leaves and goes about her business. betty looks over at rita waiting for her to tell her something. rita slowly turns and focuses on betty.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i remember something... i remember something!}
