<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{we tilt up from the road to reveal edward and karl walking out of ashton. each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{there were two roads out of ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't. people didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.}
<A>__{edward and karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. the old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{since i had no intention of ever returning to ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.}
<A>__{karl looks at the dirt road, wary.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{you know anyone's who's taken it?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{that poet, norther winslow did. he was going to paris, france. he must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell you what. you take the other way and i will cut through here. meet you on the far side.}
<A>__{a little paranoid...}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{you're not trying to run away?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{just to be sure, you can take my pack.}
<A>__{karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.}
