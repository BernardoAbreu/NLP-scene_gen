<L>__{interior doc heller's barn lab later}
<A>__{our heroes and monica pow wow, sobered by what they have seen.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what could have made such a horrible noise?}
<C>__{heller}
<P>__{(after a moment, gravely)}
<D>__{he's got the psychostridulator.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{ten years ago the kremlin's top secret psychiatric warfare division developed a prototype for a weapon that emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a violent psychotic reaction in any mammal within hearing distance. but when the old soviet union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor, doctor kopov, disappeared.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{this kopov, what happened to him?}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{not him... her.}
<A>__{they react to that piece of news, and then the bowler opens up the newspaper.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{did she look like that?}
<A>__{close on a photo of anabel and casanova, announcing their wedding engagement.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{silence; this is bad.}
<C>__{spleen}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{maybe it won't work.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{it works.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{a village in siberia was wiped out when a cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.}
<A>__{another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is. for the first time, they're really scared.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{we've got to warn the city.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{no one will believe us.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{they'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.}
<A>__{camera cuts between them as they look at each other their frightened faces, their sad, faded costuznes. even the sphinx looks scared.}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(after a moment, grimly)}
<D>__{we know what we gotta do.}
<A>__{they look at him.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{we're outnumbered twenty to one.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{it's suicide.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{maybe. but this isn't about living or dying. it's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... maybe we look a little funny...}
<B>__{on the spleen...}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{and smell a little funny. we're not bulletproof and we can't fly. but we're superheroes and that means doing what's right even when it's impossible... this is our city these are our friends, our famlies and if we don't save them, nobody will! so i say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that psycho whatchamabob and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!}
<C>__{sphinx}
<D>__{now you're talking.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{sounds good to me.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{and we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!}
<A>__{they're all with him. monica steps forward.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i just want you guys to know i may not be a superhero, but i'm with you and i want to help!}
<C>__{all}
<P>__{oh that's great... thanks, monica... (etc.)}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{we could really use some coffee }
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{and some sandwiches }
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{with mustard!}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(her feelings a little hurt)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{a few minutes later, monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes plan...}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{but that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is }
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{or even what it looks like.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{and he must have it well hidden.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{we'll just have to get lucky.}
<A>__{on monica as she gets an idea. a moment later she slips a canned tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each other in a group huddle embrace.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{go do what you gotta do. we'll meet back here at sunset... do or die.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{do or die.}
<C>__{sphinx}
<D>__{victoria o morte.}
<A>__{heroic music as...}
