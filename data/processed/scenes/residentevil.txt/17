<A>__{deep in the heart of the mist... the hummer bounces over non roads and stops fifty yards from... ...a pair of iron gates, each wrought with the letter "a". beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of... a mansion. huge. like xandau. the troopers, amazed, climb out and approach the gates.}

<D>__{our orders are to secure the area.}
<C>__{disimone}
<D>__{from what? this area's been 'secure' since the french and indian war!}
<A>__{a deep, animal snarl comes from the woods. the troopers raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush. the fog keeps sunlight from penetrating. the forest is a maze of dark shadows. leaves flutter. limbs snap. then... dark shapes can be seen moving, circling. a half dozen of them. maybe more. jill whips out a transmitter and quickly types an access code.}

<P>__{(into radio) this is valentine,}
<D>__{bravo team. we, er... we might be in trouble, here.}
<A>__{kritch! something leaps out of the brush. automatic weapons spit reflexively. kritch kritch kritch...more lunging shaes appear. the troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all sides. jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her transmitter.}

<D>__{we are in trouble!}
