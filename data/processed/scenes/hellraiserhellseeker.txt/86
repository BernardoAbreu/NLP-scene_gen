<A>__{trevor's nose has been bleeding. his eye is black and blue his lip cut. trevor looks out the window. the streets are deserted, foreign. trevor looks at the rear view mirror. the cop staring back at him averts his gaze. trevor thinks he sees something crawl into the cop's eye. lange sits next to the cop, staring back at trevor. he takes out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose.}
