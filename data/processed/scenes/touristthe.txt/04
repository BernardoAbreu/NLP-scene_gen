<A>__{her eyes scan the platform.}
<D>__{alexander's voice (v.o.) (cont'd) have faith cara. i will be with you soon.}
<A>__{cara's pov men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "the orient express." she pauses only long enough to assess and discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight... her gaze comes to rest on a well dressed french man. medium height, medium build. standing alone. examining his ticket. cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train. adjusts her hair and dress. satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the well dressed french man like a cat stalking prey. the camera admiringly follows her silky approach. the french man hears the click of her heels and looks up. his mouth falls open... his wife arrives and shuts it for him.}

<D>__{what are you doing vincent? our train car is over here!}
<A>__{with a regretful backward glance at cara, he allows himself to be dragged away. frustrated, cara turns and casts about for another possibility. she spots a tousle haired man seated on a bench.}

<D>__{all aboard! all aboard the 4:25 is departing!}
<A>__{tousle hair gathers his bags to get on the train. encouraged, cara moves to cut him off. as tousle hair stands up reveal... he's six foot seven. cara stops short, irritated. the man behind her boarding the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't notice. bam he walks straight into her.}

<D>__{sorry! excuse me. pardone moi.}
<A>__{frank taylor (30's, amiable) is a cheerful american tourist. open face, completely lacking in guile. frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around cara and boards the train. cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. frank is a man of average size, average build... she peers over her glasses at him. and her expression slowly changes. she follows him onto the train.}

<A>__{a good looking englishman loitering further down the platform, reading the herald tribune. or rather, not reading it. he's been watching cara. he lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.}
