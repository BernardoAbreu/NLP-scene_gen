<L>__{interior ronnie's kitchen night}
<A>__{she turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the oven. she puts it down on the counter and cross to the refrigerator. she opens the door and looks inside. the refrigerator door obscures half the frame... she digs around for something... we're sure that when she closes the door, he's going to be behind it... she takes out a head of lettuce and... closes the door... still no one there. she turns... clarence is standing there. dripping wet. ronnie shrieks... the knife flashes forward... she grabs the lid from the sauce pan and clang... fends off the blade. she bolts for the hallway. clarence grabs her by the blouse... rip! she pulls away.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{she races down the hall. clarence lunges into frame. she goes down... he goes down... the knife goes skidding down the hallway... ronnie scrambles to get it... clarence has her by the ankle... she claws for the knife... just out of reach.}
