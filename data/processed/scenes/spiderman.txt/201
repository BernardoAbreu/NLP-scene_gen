<L>__{exterior the bottom of the building night}
<A>__{spider man falls through the air. he shoots up a web and thwips, it sticks to the rocky bottom of the foundation. ock appears in the hole. he sees spidey's dilemma, hanging on a thread of web. a half broken waldo snakes down and clips the web. but the web sticks to the waldo! ock shakes it, but he can't get loose. spider man shoots out another web at the rock bottom and, with the leverage, he pulls ock out. ock swings down in a wide arc and his waldos catch on the rock upside down. he holds on fiercely. ock scrambles out to the side of the center and begins looking for an entry. spider man is right on his tail. the building pitches sideways! ock turns to face spider man, his broken waldos out for battle. spidey grabs an exposed pipe and breaks it off, brandishing it like a broad sword.}
<D>__{spider man let's have it, old boy! a bizarre duel takes place. the center pitches this way and that. spidey and ock move from foothold to foothold, from window to ledge to parapet.}
<A>__{now the center pitches to a 45 degree angle. they duel upside down! a window grate crashes open and liz comes flying out, holding onto the grate for dear life!}
<D>__{spider man liz!! ock seizes the opportunity to whack spidey across the head. spidey loses his footing but the building now lurches back and liz goes flying back inside. spidey ducks inside too and pulls the grate.}
<A>__{spider man uses his great strength to move a huge piece of scientific machinery in front of the grate.}
<D>__{spider man come on.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{where's peter? he must be here somewhere. spider man}
<P>__{(pulling her ahead)}
<D>__{he's around, don't worry... we'll find him.}
