<L>__{interior courtroom witness stand later}
<A>__{venkman himself is on the stand and louis is questioning him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you didn't really mean to do anything bad and you really love the city and won't ever do anything like this again, right?}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{objection, your honor. he's leading the witness.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the witness is leading him. sustained.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{okay, let me rephrase that question.}
<P>__{(to venkman)}
<D>__{didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{yes, i did. we were city champs.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{objection. irrelevant and immaterial.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained. mr. tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(to venkman)}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{no, i think you've helped them enough already.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{no, i guess not.}
<P>__{(to the prosecutor)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{the prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{so, dr. venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{seventy seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.}
<A>__{the gallery laughs and the judge gavels for order.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{keep that up, mister, and i will find you in contempt.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{sorry, your honor, but when somebody sets me up like that i can't resist.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{i will ask you again, dr. venkman. why were you digging the hole? and please remember that you're under oath.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but i'm going to tell you the truth. there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. that's where we come in.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{so what are you saying? that the world of the supernatural is your special province?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{no, i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.}
<A>__{the spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.}
