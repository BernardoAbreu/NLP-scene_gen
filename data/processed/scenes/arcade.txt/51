<L>__{exterior slip stream, inc. day}
<A>__{the slip stream compound comprises a cluster of mirrored, antiseptic looking buildings. carefully maintained greens surround the compound, dotted with perfectly positioned trees. the whole effect, greenery included, seems prefabricated and sterile. we move with the camera, sweeping in and dropping low, across the main concourse and up the stone steps to the main lobby...}
<L>__{interior slip stream lobby day}
<A>__{alex and nick are moving across the lobby. nick is still carrying his skateboard. the two of them look extremely out of place, being that the rest of the people bustling around them are "dressed for success".}
<B>__{their p.o.v.}
<A>__{as they approach a prefab receptionist sitting behind and enormous desk. the guy's smile is so perfect he must've had it tattooed on. he wears one of those obnoxious phone headsets.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we need to see mr. difford.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{i see. and do you have an appointment?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, but it's important and if you'd...}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment, i won't be able to help you. if you'd like, you can call his office from our courtesy phone outside and schedule one ...}
<A>__{nick reaches across the desk and snags the receptionist by his shirt, jerking him forward.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(menacing)}
<D>__{if difford's not out here it one minute we're calling the news and informing them that your fucking games are whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. i'm talking public relations nightmare here, buddy. satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit.}
<A>__{the receptionist glances at alex who puts on a stern face and nods. nick releases his grip. the receptionist smooths out his shirt and smiles.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{one moment please...}
<P>__{(punches in extension)}
<D>__{rachel, would you be kind enough to tell mr. difford that we have a situation in the lobby which requires his immediate attention?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the receptionist clasps his hands together and looks back up.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{mr. difford will be right with you.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why thank you.}
<A>__{alex and nick move away from the reception desk, having caused quite a scene. the rest of the visitors watch them with curiosity.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{virgin sacrifices?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{drives 'em crazy every time.}
<A>__{nick casts his eyes over the walls where graphics from various slip stream games are displayed. he stops on one display in particular, a triptych of sorts featuring the haunting face of arcade. bing! alex and nick turn at the sound, just in time to see difford exiting an elevator and briskly making his way towards them.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{nick, alex, how are we today?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how'd you know it was us?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{security camera.}
<P>__{(points to one)}
<D>__{pulled your files before i came down. be careful what you say, kids ... i know where you live.}
<A>__{difford laughs and claps nick on the back.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now what seems to be the problem?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's the game, arcade.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{you don't like it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's gotta be the understatement of the century. it's killing people.}
<A>__{beat. difford looks from alex to nick, and back again. his smile fades from his face.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{if this is a joke, i'm not laughing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{neither are we. something's wrong with the game, mr. difford.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{why don't we take this into my office.}
