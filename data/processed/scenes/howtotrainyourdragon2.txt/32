<L>__{exterior dragon mountain moments later}
<A>__{(scene 1900 surprise guests) valka rushes out to find... drago's armada in the lagoon below and his forces of thousands now landed upon the beach. they launch catapults and ballistas into the icy spires, gaining entrance into the mountain's tunnels. hiccup, stoick, and gobber catch up to valka.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{valka tries to hurry off, fuming. stoick stops her.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{val! it's all right, it's all right. we're a team now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now what do you want to do?}
<A>__{she glances from hiccup to stoick.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{we have to save the dragons.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{aye. you got it!}
<A>__{he throws an arm around hiccup.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{come on, son.}
<B>__{on the battlefield}
<A>__{valka's dragons swoop down to engage the attackers, picking up soldiers and carrying them off while drago stands in the line of fire, unflinching. the catapults continue to bring down the icy defenses of dragon mountain. drago's men pour into the tunnels.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! we need to draw the alpha out.}
<A>__{drago's armored dragon army takes wing, clashing with valka's dragons in the skies.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{ready the traps!}
<A>__{iron jaws are opened like bear traps, revealing screeching `bait' dragons within. valka's dragons swoop down to rescue them, only to be snapped up in the fearsome jaws. a second set of traps are cocked open, but instead of dragon cries, zippleback gas seeps out... followed by an explosion. the twins rocket out of the trap, riding barf and belch.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{surprise! yeah!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{they're joined by astrid and the rest of the gang, bursting out of the traps atop meatlug and hookfang. eret comes flying out last, wailing aboard stormfly. he struggles to hold on, as she rejoins astrid (riding meatlug, along with fishlegs). he gives them a sheepish shrug.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you really are full of surprises.}
<A>__{she leaps onto stormfly, steadying them.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{together they rocket across the sky...}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{dragon riders coming through!}
<A>__{and dive bomb the traps, setting them aflame. the yokes and leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.}
<C>__{drago}
