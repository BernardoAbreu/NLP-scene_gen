<A>__{bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her footsteps.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{die, bitch!}
<A>__{he fires, finger pumping, bullets erupting through the floor around her feet. screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall. his shoulders oozing blood, bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as she sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall. beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed. she flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the wall is perforated with bullets.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck! god damn bitch! what are you doing? i don't believe this is happening!}
<A>__{she can hear him coming, his voice echoing through the hollow building. she looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're dead! you're fucking dead! i'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this!}
<A>__{bain fires up at the ceiling, the bullet tearing through the floor, whizzing past electra's head. if she moves he'll know her position. he fires another. electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. another shot. she fires back. bain closes, as they both start firing, silenced weapons, flashing, pumping lead at unseen targets. her gun empties first. he laughs hearing the click.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{game over, bitch!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{bain!}
<A>__{rath's scream echoes up through the building. before bain can target him, rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost. he scans the hotel's courtyard. the last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream like grid resembling a chess board. electra sees her chance. she leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. the two men watch the gun clatter to the floor as she races back to the room.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck no!}
<A>__{rath grabs the gun tracking bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor. rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{bain reaches the top of the stairs before electra gets to the end of the hall. rath sees it all happening.}
<C>__{rath}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{electra!}
<A>__{time becomes syrup.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{down! get down!}
<A>__{bain fires. electra dives. the blackened door jamb splinter bursts in front of her. she bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room. bain hurries down the hall after her as rath bolts for the stairs. seeing rath exposed on the stairs, bain whips around and fires, the wall shredding behind rath as he dives back down into the shadows. ripping open bain's duffel bag electra grabs bain's .22. bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door. inside the room electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out the door. it spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open. a gun clip skitters across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard. rath and bain both see it. staying hidden, rath immediately circles towards it. bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door. something's got to give. unsure what to do electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door. bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502. rath sees that bain is going after electra. he takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows bolting into the open, rath is focused wholly on the clip, the ground a blur beneath him bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after rath. two more steps and rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as the rifle spits rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.}

<A>__{the scope glides up zeroing the back of rath's head.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{game }
<A>__{bain squeezes the trigger click the rifle is empty. bain screams in disbelief. rolling over, rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but bain is gone. electra searches the room for a way out. keeping the gun trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole that bain fell through. grimacing, rath struggles to his feet.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{electra!}
<A>__{bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying. electra spins to shoot but the floor suddenly cracks open, swallowing her. limping, lurching up the stairs, rath hears the crash. jarred by the fall, electra drags herself away from the open ceiling.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the gun! he needs the gun! get rid of it! throw it!}
<A>__{she looks up for bain but he has again disappeared. she looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands. his leg soaked with blood, rath rumbles down the hall. black with soot, bain descends soundless, serpent like to the fourth level through another burned opening. electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner. she is almost there when we see bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. lumbering, rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. hearing bain, electra turns. in one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist. the gun falls. rath hears her scream. electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. she gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. bain grabs the gun. rath whips into the room blasting bullets chasing bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. rath goes to electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. from within the labyrinth, rath hears bain begin to laugh.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{hey! tell me something, bobby boy.}
<A>__{electra comes to, her eyes blinking open.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{are you still thinking that you're going to take me?}
<A>__{electra is trying to focus, as rath listens to the voice, searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from everywhere.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{no, i don't think you are. you know what i think?}
<A>__{the voice is closer. rath wipes the stinging sweat from his eyes.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{i think you're thinking what i'm thinking.}
<A>__{still dizzy, electra taps her fist against rath's chest.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{you know what i'm thinking, bobby boy?!}
<A>__{it seems as though bain is in the room.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{you know what i'm thinking?!}
<A>__{electra opens her fist and inside rath sees the handful of bullets from the other gun. bain whirls into view, his gun whipping around to rath who turns too slow. bain pumps the trigger. one click. another. and another. the gun is empty.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah, i know what you're thinking.}
<A>__{he levels his gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{game over.}
<A>__{rath fires, over and over, emptying the gun into bain's head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony railing and falls, twisting through lightless space, slamming to the stone floor dead.}
