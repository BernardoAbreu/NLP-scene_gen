<A>__{gil wanders. eventually he is at a lovely spot. perhaps by the river, the bridge or somewhere else but he's just wandering lost. finally he looks at his watch. either by his watch or a nearby building clock, the hands move to exactly midnight. perhaps midnight chimes somewhere. at precisely that moment a car happens to pull up along side him. inside are two men and two woman elegant they have champagne and glasses and they pour from the open bottle and drink happily.}
