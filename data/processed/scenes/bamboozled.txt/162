<D>__{our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, mantan. thanks for coming in.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{tavis, thank you for having me.}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{before we begin, i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview. you could have chosen mike wallace, barbara walters, jane pauley, whatnot but you're here.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{i'm more comfortable around my people.}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{let's jump right into it. your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. how do you see all of this?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{yo, tavis, check it out. this is the two one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. like my man mase says, "it's all about the benjamins."}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{money and nothing else?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{money makes the world go round. it ain't no joke being poor. i know whati'mtalkin''bout. y'knowwhati'msayin'? i've lived on the street. i've been homeless. i've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{is it inevitable that the game plays you?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{no if you go with the flow, tavis. that's what a lot of negroes don't understand. protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. if people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. or better yet write your own show. do it better.}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{i don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. mantan the new millennium minstrel show is universal. it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem. this is america. our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. i'm not gonna box myself in. this show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.}
<C>__{tavis smiley}
<D>__{i admit, that's a very hard thing to do. quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, da bomb. 125% pure pleasure malt liquor. it makes you wanna get ya freak on and timmi hillnigger. 125% authentic git toe gear when you want to be git toed fabulous.}

<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{that's our opinion.}
<C>__{big black }
<D>__{you're a traitor to the race. a tool for the caucasoids.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{why? because i'm successful? because i don't use "causcasoids" as an excuse for not fulfilling my dreams?}
<C>__{big black }
<D>__{i ain't hearing all dat noise. you getting played and you don't even know it.}
