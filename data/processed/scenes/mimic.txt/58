<L>__{interior subway tracks dusk}
<A>__{a train blurs by. a flashlight beam over dirty gravel. tilt with the beam to see ernest walking his beat past tracks and girders. hulking out of service subway cars surround him. he shines his light on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls. a sound catches his attention. a rustling. he notices something off to a corner, walks over to it. a shiny brown lump in the corner, covered in garbage. he touches the lump with his shoe. it stirs slightly. he touches it again... ...and a pair of legs suddenly lash out, kicking at him reflexively. ernest jumps back. another set of legs emerges... oddly enough, ernest relaxes.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{chrissakes...}
<A>__{he grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it. we see that it was just a shiny brown tarp. underneath, a group of three homeless people emaciated, toothless sleeping intertwined for warmth. in the dim light, they almost seem like a single organism.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{guys, c'mon.}
<A>__{the homeless people stare back at him mutely. ernest starts getting annoyed.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i told you to stick by the maintenance area.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{nah... it's private property now.}
<A>__{ernest looks at her, confused.}
<C>__{skeletal bum}
<D>__{he eats down there.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{homeless man}
<D>__{the stickman.}
<C>__{bag lady}
<D>__{long john.}
<A>__{the homeless man points. ernest turns his light. another silhouette of the overcoat man drawn on the wall. an arrow below it points east.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{graffiti artist, uh?}
<P>__{(to homeless people)}
<D>__{look guys, just get off my beat, you hear? get moving.}
<A>__{ernest hustles them out. the homeless people glare at him, pick up their things and head into the gloom. ernest watches them go. he turns back to the graffiti painting of the stickman.}
