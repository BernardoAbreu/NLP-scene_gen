<L>__{interior spa mud room day}
<A>__{mrs. windham vandermark, late 40s, brunette, east coast hoity toity — lies on a table like a corpse, stiff with mud, cucumbers over her eyes. elle and emmett poke their heads in.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{mrs. windham vandermark?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{we're here from austen, platt, jaret & donovan}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{so, you found me.}
<A>__{emmett looks at elle.}
<C>__{emmett}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{she's naked.}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{i ' m covered in very expensive egyptian mud ••— hardly naked.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(to emmett)}
<D>__{i will cover her — parts.}
<A>__{elle settles on three washcloths, strategically placed.}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{so, i hear the tart from california shot heyworth.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. do you have any reason to believe it did?}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{i never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun—}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(interrupting her)}
<D>__{she's not!}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth's relationship?}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? she said they humped like gorillas . chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{i ' m sure that was very awkward for chutney.}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{but i guess it wasn't enough for brooke.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{mrs . windham vandermark}
<D>__{haven't you seen the cabana boy?}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mrs. windham vandermark}
<D>__{like i said, i've never met brooke, but i have seen her from a distance. when i ' d come over to pick up the alimony check that heyworth forgot to mail every month, she'd be out by the pool, with mr. hot pants hovering over her with some pink drink.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{hovering?}
<C>__{mrs . windham vandermark}
<D>__{i didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but i ' d bet my next check that that ' s where he was about to put it}
