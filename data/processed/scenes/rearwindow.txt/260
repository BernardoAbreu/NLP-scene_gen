<L>__{interior jeff's apartment night medium shot}
<A>__{he lowers the lens.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{he must have gone somewhere to the right.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back as lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. as she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. she seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. jeff turns around to face the room.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{all day long i've tried to keep my mind on work.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{thinking about thorwald?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(nods yes)}
<D>__{and you, and you friend doyle }
<P>__{(stops, to jeff)}
<D>__{did you hear from him again since he left?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{not a word. he was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. he must be still on it.}
<A>__{as he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. he starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. we see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. jeff watches her.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{something on your mind, lisa?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it doesn't make sense to me.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what doesn't?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{women aren't that unpredictable.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(losing a little patience)}
<D>__{lisa i can't guess what you're thinking.}
<A>__{the camera closes in, lisa stops, faces him. her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a woman has a favorite handbag it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. why?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{because she didn't know she was going on a trip and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.}
<A>__{the camera eases back.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but only her husband would know that.}
<P>__{(starts to pace again)}
<D>__{and the jewelry! women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{do they hide it in their husband's clothes?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{they do not! and they don't leave it behind them. a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{inside stuff?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{basic equipment. you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i'm with you, sweetie, but detective thomas j. doyle has a pat answer for that.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{that mrs. thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's what the witnesses told him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well, i have a pat rebuttal for mr. doyle that couldn't be mrs. thorwald or i don't know women.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{still those witnesses.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{we'll agree they saw a woman but she wasn't mrs. thorwald. that is, yet.}
<A>__{she comes over to jeff. he reaches up, takes her hand.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{he pulls her into his lap. she puts her arms around him. she is very happy, and kisses jeff's cheek.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. he doesn't sound like much of a detective.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't be too hard on him. he's a steady worker. i wish he'd get there, though.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(nuzzling jeff)}
<D>__{don't rush me. we have all night.}
<A>__{there's a pause. then jeff moves back a little to look her straight in the eye.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{we have all what?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{night. i'm going to stay with you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you'll have to clear that through my landlord }
<A>__{she cuts him off with a kiss. when she pulls back}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i have the whole weekend off.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well that's fine, but i only have one bed, and }
<A>__{lisa smothers him with another kiss. she lets up.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{say anything else, and i will stay tomorrow night too.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{lisa, i won't be able to give you any }
<A>__{she smothers him with still another kiss. then moves back.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{ pajamas.}
<A>__{she laughs, gets up. goes to the large handbag on the table. is is a mark cross ladies 'attache' case.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you said i'd have to live out of one suitcase}
<P>__{(picks up case)}
<D>__{i will bet yours isn't this small?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's a suitcase?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(starting to open it)}
<D>__{a mark cross overnight case, anyway. compact, but ample enough.}
<A>__{she has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay. she comes to jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the inside of the case}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i will trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(gives in smiling)}
<D>__{i'd be no better than thorwald, to refuse.}
<A>__{the sound from the party in the song writer's apartment becomes more noticeable as his party grows. and at this point he begins playing the song he has been composing for the past few days.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{there's that song again.}
<A>__{she gets up from jeff's lap, and puts the overnight case on the table. open. she goes to the window, and looks toward the song writers' apartment. jeff turns with her.}
