<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{key inserted into door lock night a door is pushed open. rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. starts to shut the door when two men appear from the shadows. the first is short, well dressed. his name is vic. the second is large, heavy set, shaved head. his name is cutless supreme. cutless supreme is not a man to be messed with.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{keepin' some late hours.}
<A>__{rodriguez looks at cutless supreme.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{what the hell you doin'? what're my neighbors gonna think?}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i apologize. i understand your concerns. but you must understand that, unlike a bank, i cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. i am forced to employ the likes of mr. cutless supreme, whom i might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. i am the real loser here. and i am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty seven thousand, nine hundred forty two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{i can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what i can do.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{look at me. do i have a wife and three kids? do i have a good job at ibm? am i a handsome guy? no, no and no. i loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then i am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that i have needs, too. the point of which is, i already have a fuckin' miserable life. so don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.}
<A>__{rodriguez steps toward vic, but cutless supreme slides in between them. rodriguez isn't going to win this one.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{all i'm askin' is that you be responsible. is that unreasonable?}
<A>__{rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. there aren't any. he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{four thousand is all i got.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i am proportionally reassured. you purchased yourself an extension.}
<A>__{vic takes the money, heads for the street. rodriguez watches vic walk away. cutless supreme watches rodriguez.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{cutless supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that?}
<C>__{cutless supreme}
<D>__{it was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. i was born in the back seat.}
<A>__{rodriguez glares at cutless supreme, then he shuts the door.}
