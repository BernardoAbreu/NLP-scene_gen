<L>__{exterior the edwards house med. shot aaron late afternoon}
<A>__{the ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross timbered roof, deep windows. a small gallery or porch extends across the front. aaron edwards comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out curious but not at all apprehensive. aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down swept mustache; a gentler looking man than ethan and possibly a few years older. as he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, lucy, comes out to stand behind him. lucy is from 16 to 18 a pleasant, feminine girl. she is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. in the next instant martha edwards follows the daughter onto the porch. martha is a still lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. those hands will never be idle when martha is on scene... and now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that lucy has forgotten her task and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.}
