<L>__{interior viktor's car day}
<A>__{the sunglasses clad simone is a mannequin, seated in the driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel. seat fully reclined on the passenger side, viktor drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road ahead. he speaks on a phone through the simone synthesizer.}
<D>__{simone viktor i'd love to stop somewhere but i'm late. i'm on my way to see viktor now.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no, i understand. that's what i want to talk about. i don't know if you know this, simone, but viktor and i were married once. simone viktor i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go. i owe viktor everything.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i think he owes more to you. but that's not important now. i know what's going on between you two. simone viktor i want to reassure you, elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(rueful smile)}
<D>__{you don't have to protect my feelings, simone. i don't blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world. simone viktor}
<P>__{(breaking character)}
<D>__{i'm not }
<P>__{(correcting himself)}
<D>__{he's not.}
<A>__{viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across his lane, almost striking elaine's car swerving back at the last second.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{my god, are you alright, simone? simone viktor damn }
<P>__{(struggling to stay in her his lane)}
<D>__{yes i }
<P>__{(regaining control)}
<D>__{ i'm just a little tired. listen, elaine, viktor and i it's strictly a working relationship. we could never be anything else. we're just so... different.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{exactly. you're a household name now. you're moving in entirely different worlds. that's why i hope you're not toying with viktor. simone viktor it sounds like you still have feelings for him.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{we have a daughter together. i just don't want to see viktor get hurt. simone viktor i don't know how many times i have to say this, elaine, but viktor and i are not in love.}
<P>__{(joking weakly)}
<D>__{i only make love to the camera.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{simone, i recognize the shirt you're wearing. i gave it to viktor on his birthday.}
<A>__{over correcting his steering, viktor drifts into the next lane, dangerously close to a pick up truck that has to swerve to avoid him.}
<D>__{simone viktor christ }
<P>__{(still struggling to stay on the road)}
<D>__{elaine, i know how it looks but...}
<P>__{(blurting it out)}
<D>__{... it would mean a lot to viktor if you'd go with him to the oscars. if you won't do it for him, please do it for me.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(reluctant, frightened by simone's erratic driving)}
<D>__{okay for you. simone viktor}
<P>__{(sigh of relief)}
<D>__{thanks. this is my exit so, i }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'm glad we talked. simone viktor good bye.}
<A>__{viktor's car swerves to the right. elaine looks back in her rearview mirror, concerned. elaine just misses the sight of viktor's car rear ending the truck in front of him.}
