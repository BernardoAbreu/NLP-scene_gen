<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{until you officially take over the office of national drug control policy, under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or having someone in the room. there are a lot of interests in this town and, right now, they're all scared of you. the reason they're scared of you...technically, you have veto power over their budgets. so think about that: fbi, cia, dea, customs, treasury, atf, defense, irs, radio shack and the dmv, they're all gonna want to speak to you. and that's the good news... you'll also be meeting senators and congressman, each with a specially prepared question. their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart. if you lecture them, they won't think you respect them. if you respond with utter humility, they will. remember, this is about your respect for them, and the president's respect for them. speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from russia and china, we'll get you in there for some face time, let the two of you catch up.}
