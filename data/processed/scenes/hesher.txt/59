<A>__{tj and dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12. eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them adults and a few kids. some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam cups. the tone is sombre. dad and tj look unsure of themselves. the chairperson of the meeting is meryl, a 42 year old grief counsellor.}
<C>__{meryl}
<D>__{ok, so welcome everyone to the transformational grief group. my name is meryl. we should start off by going around the circle and introducing ourselves and briefly explaining why we are here. hi miss, would you please start us off?}

<C>__{coleen}
<D>__{we are the bolder family. i am coleen and this is my husband jack. our daughter cynthia was murdered last year.}
<P>__{(she chokes a bit)}
<D>__{she was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick.}
<A>__{she can't go on. her husband jack sets his hand on her shoulder. she is able to hold back the tears.}

<A>__{dad finishes mid sentence, then brief silence.}
