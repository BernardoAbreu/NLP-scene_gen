<L>__{interior diagnostics room}
<A>__{orderly arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots: an umbrella bot flips open and overextends. the orderly arms struggle to close it. a defibrillator bot shocks a crash test dummy. it bursts into flames. eve is awoken from "sleep" mode. a series of tests begin. eve is annoyed but calm. it's all routine. an orderly arm easily detaches her gun arm.}
<B>__{out in the repair ward}
<A>__{wall e stares at the frosted glass doors. can only make out eve's silhouette. to him, her arm is being ripped off.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah!}
<B>__{back inside with eve}
<A>__{the orderly arm tests eve's circuitry. her insides light up. it tickles.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<A>__{next to her the umbrella bot's mechanism screeches. outside with wall e wall e watches in horror. it looks as if eve is being tortured. mistakes the screeching for her screams. wall e struggles to free himself.}
<B>__{inside with eve}
<A>__{she is washed and scrubbed. a circular buffer cleans between her head and body. it feels good. back on wall e it looks as if eve is being beheaded. he needs to stop the torture. wall e fires his cutting laser at his pen's force field. the barrier shorts out. wall e tumbles to the floor. lands on his "play" button. poysc blares across the ward. the rejects all stop and stare.}
<D>__{wall e eeeeeevaaaahh!!}
<A>__{wall e races to the diagnostics room. crashes right through the glass doors. finds eve surrounded by orderly arms. grabs eve's separated gun arm. points it at the orderly arms.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(angry beeps)}
<D>__{[let her go, or i will shoot!]}
<A>__{his hands tremble, don knotts style. doesn't realize... ...he's holding the gun backwards. eve slowly reaches for the weapon.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{("put the gun down...")}
<D>__{wall e...}
<A>__{an orderly lunges at him. wall e panics. shoots! the gun fires backwards. it blasts through the repair ward. blows up the repair ward control panel. wall e shrinks. he knows he's in trouble.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{the smoking remains of the control panel short circuit. ...all orderly arms go limp... ...the repair ward doors open up... ...and all force fields disappear... the rejects look at each other for a beat. then cheer wildly. we're free! the mob of robots all rush wall e. lift him on their shoulders. carry their hero out of the ward. wall e still holding on to eve's gun arm. eve watches in astonishment. this day just gets worse and worse. she flies off after them.}
