<A>__{gittes and evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. he sees evelyn first.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{hello there, i'm mr. palmer. can i help you folks?}
<A>__{then he gets a clear look at gittes, bruised, trousers torn, etc.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yes, i sure hope so. it's dad.}
<P>__{(indicating his disheveled appearance)}
<D>__{i just can't handle him anymore, can i, sweetheart?}
<A>__{evelyn shakes her head.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{oh my goodness.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{nothing to do with dad. it's me, actually.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{they just don't get along very well. dad's a lamb with anyone else.}
<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(not so sure)}
<D>__{oh, well, i don't know.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{naturally, i want the best for him, money is no object.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{perhaps if we could meet your father.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{there's just one question.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{do you accept anyone of the jewish persuasion?}
<A>__{evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question.}
<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(very embarrassed)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we don't.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{don't be sorry, neither does dad. wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?}
<A>__{evelyn stares back at gittes, amused and appalled. she manages to nod.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{just to be certain, i wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?}
<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(polite but pointed)}
<D>__{we don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. i know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.}
<A>__{gittes locks eyes with palmer.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{that's exactly what we wanted to hear.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{oh, good.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{i don't think so. be happy to show you.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. it's nearly bedtime.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{we understand, c'mon, sweetheart.}
<A>__{he takes evelyn.}
