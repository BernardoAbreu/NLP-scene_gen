<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior med lab annex}
<A>__{the door dimples with a clanging impact, separating slightly from its frame. another crash, the squeal of tortured steel. newt grabs ripley by the hand and tugs her across the room.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{come on! this way.}
<A>__{she leads ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open. newt starts inside but ripley pulls her back.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{stay behind me.}
<A>__{ripley trades her rifle for gorman's flamethrower before he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a tight fit. newt scrambles in behind, followed by hicks, gorman and vasquez on rearguard. glancing back fearfully newt pushes on ripley's butt as they crawl rapidly through the shaft.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{come on. crawl faster.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{do you know how to get to the landing field from here?}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{sure. go left.}
<A>__{ripley turns into a larger main duct where there is enough room to crab walk in a low crouch. she runs, scraping her back on the ceiling. the troopers' armor clatters in the confined space. they approach an intersection. she fires the flamethrower around the corner, the looks. clear.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{go right.}
<A>__{they sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze becoming a blur. ripley fires the flamethrower periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or lower levels.}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(into headset)}
<D>__{bishop, you read me? come in, over.}
<A>__{there is a long pause then bishop's voice, almost unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.}
<C>__{bishop}
<P>__{(voice over; static)}
<D>__{yes, i read you. not very well...}
