<DIAL>__{Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?}

There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes a run for it as well. Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight train, frothing like white water. Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof of the Outpost. The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything and everyone in its way. Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling under the onslaught. Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a stop. Then it's all quiet. Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.

They punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. Charles bridge. On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from the river. Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake. Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.

The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact. Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab starts to DIVE.}

At first they see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges. The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, walking up the boat ramp. His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't seen before. The Phoenix has risen. Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.}
