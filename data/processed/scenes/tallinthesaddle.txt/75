<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{she looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say something sarcastic. then, repressing herself, she wheels her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. rocklin throws an amused glance, at juan, who has been watching with an enigmatic expression. he returns rocklin's look with a stern, menacing frown. then, with a gentle flick of the rein, he urges his horse after arly. completely baffled, rocklin scratches his head for a second, then follows.}
