<L>__{exterior carolina mall day}
<A>__{ronnie stands in front of a cadillac with a boot on one of his tires. a local news camera crew comes up to ronnie and the female reporter starts asking questions.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i can't answer anything.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{we heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women. do you care to comment?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm not allowed to comment on that situation.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{so you admit there is a situation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now? get real, lady.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<P>__{(to her camera crew)}
<D>__{we're wasting our time here. let's go find some police to interview.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good luck.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it just means you won't find any police.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{are you telling me the police haven't even been called!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{ewww, alert the media.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you?}
<A>__{ronnie smiles like he knows a secret.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{yeah, right. why would they leave you in charge?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{first of all, if there was a situation to be handled, i don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that i would be in charge.}
<A>__{the reporter waves for her crew to start filming.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<P>__{(setting a trap)}
<D>__{look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well for your information, i'm in charge of this whole fucking operation.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{i don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, ms. hot fuckin' shit news lady. i'm the first line of defense against this pervert. as the law's right hand, i'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. i'm the defender of this war zone. just me and my goddamn flashlight.}
<A>__{just then, saddamn, an angry middle easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him, comes running up to ronnie.}
<C>__{saddamn}
<D>__{you motherfucker, you put a boot on my car!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(cop voice)}
<D>__{i warned you about parking in the fire lane, saddamn!}
<C>__{saddamn}
<D>__{fuck you, ronnie! take that goddamn boot off of my car.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(going into cop voice)}
<D>__{step away now!}
<C>__{saddamn}
<D>__{i pay good money to this mall. don't tell me where to park!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{sir, i will be forced to take action if you do not step back!}
<C>__{saddamn}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill you!}
<A>__{ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots saddamn. saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching. he is fucking out of it! ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{as i was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak. for all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away.}
<C>__{saddamn}
<P>__{(still fucked up)}
<D>__{i can't believe you tased me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to the man)}
<D>__{that's right and i've got another one waiting right here for you.}
