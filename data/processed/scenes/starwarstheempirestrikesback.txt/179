<A>__{vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships. the avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction. no one on that ship or on vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the avenger, is the pirateship, the millennium falcon.}

<D>__{captain solo, this time you have gone too far.}
<P>__{(chewie growls)}
<D>__{no, i will not be quiet, chewbacca. why doesn't anyone listen to me?}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(to chewie)}
<D>__{the fleet is beginning to break up. go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.}
<A>__{chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i really don't see how that is going to help. surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. the empire may be gracious enough...}
<A>__{leia reaches over and shuts off threepio, mid sentence.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{what did you have in mind for your next move?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, if they follow standard imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed, then we just float away.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{with the rest of the garbage. then what?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. got any ideas?}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{no. where are we?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{the anoat system.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{anoat system. there's not much there.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{no. well, wait. this is interesting. lando.}
<A>__{he points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel. leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot. small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{lando system?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{lando's not a system, he's a man. lando calrissian. he's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. you'd like him.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{bespin. it's pretty far, but i think we can make it.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(reading from the computer)}
<D>__{a mining colony?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, a tibanna gas mine. lando conned somebody out of it. we go back a long way, lando and me.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{can you trust him?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{no. but he has no love for the empire, i can tell you that.}
<A>__{chewie barks over the intercom. han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{here we go, chewie. stand by. detach!}
<A>__{han leans back in his chair and gives leia an invisible smile. she thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{you do have your moments. not many, but you have them.}
