<A>__{morris emerges from the office. he glances at jesse, then shrugs on his coat and leaves... jesse looks back at the office doorway. follow jesse in...}
<L>__{interior lucian adam's office}
<A>__{...past kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable room, we finally see lucian adams. jesse is not invited to sit.}
<C>__{lucian}
<P>__{(to kiersey)}
<D>__{give us a minute.}
<A>__{kiersey walks out and shuts the door...}
<B>__{on lucian}
<A>__{he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{you have a son now, right?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{as he removes the shirt he's wearing, reveal tattoos: black sun on his back. german runes, ss bolts, hrungnir's heart. and around his stomach, a belt of norse gods with the words, "invisible empire." prison tats, dark and aged.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{what'd you name him?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i named him ray.}
<A>__{lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens cuff links.}
<C>__{lucian}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{heard the cops smacked you around inside.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{'wasn't too bad.}
<A>__{lucian checks his hair.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{you've been a busy man, jesse. more ways than one.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{looks like you done just fine without me. business rollin' through the door.}
<A>__{and lucian finally turns; looks at jesse, eyes measuring...}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{last i saw you, you asked for time. time to raise a family. time to straighten things out.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i gave you that time... then safe jobs start poppin' up. lafayette. new orleans. clinton. baton rouge. all over. the boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet. but they all professional. burn jobs. hot weld oxygen. laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.}
<P>__{(locked on jesse)}
<D>__{i knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this.}
<A>__{jesse smiles slightly. they know each other well... ...when lucian's smile suddenly drops. there's a flash of controlled anger across his face; and we feel a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{jesse... with all the work you been doin': diamonds. emeralds. a dozen safe jobs, behind my back...}
<P>__{(predatory)}
<D>__{where's the tribute to the greater cause?}
<A>__{jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. sets it on the desk... he pours the contents into lucian's palm: diamonds and}
<B>__{emeralds.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{like i said, i just needed time.}
<A>__{lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: diamonds and emeralds... a slow smile spreads across his face.}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{well, even prophets stumble once in a while.}
<A>__{lucian embraces jesse. tight. then, softly in his ear:}
<C>__{lucian}
<D>__{it's a shame about your brother.}
<A>__{as they part, their eyes meet. something passes between them... i e. jesse's truck, traveling back road night jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. lynn in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. they're driving under the cover of darkness...}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i don't understand. why do we have to leave the state? you're not tellin' me something. you're not tellin' me a lot.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it ain't safe here no more. you wanted out? this is out.}
