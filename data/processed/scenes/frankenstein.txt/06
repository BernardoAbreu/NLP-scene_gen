<A>__{the nevsky in the distance. the dogs come howling across the ice toward us. the men trail substantially behind. boom down to the icy boulders f.g. a massive hand comes briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal surgical scars marring the wrist. a huge dark figure wipes frame, fleeing into the rocks. the dogs come bounding past in pursuit, snarling and slavering. the running men hear an inhuman howl rise amidst those of the dogs. a vicious free for all echoes from the rocks. barking gives way to shrill squeals. an object is launched from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc. some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground with tremendous impact before them... ...and they find themselves staring in horror at the sight of the lead dog. silence now. those who have fallen, rise. walton cocks his rifle. the group proceeds, picks and axes held ready, slowly skirting the rocks... ...and the massacre is revealed. blood stained ice. dead, mangled animals strewn about. one twitching survivor crawls toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its entrails in a red smear.}

<A>__{they follow his gaze. bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, ascending the rocks. most are smeared and vague... but one is clearly a bare human footprinterior several men cross themselves. walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the surviving dog. blam! a single bullet to the brain ends its misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. the shot echoes for miles.}
