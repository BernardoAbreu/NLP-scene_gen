<L>__{interior outer radio station night}
<A>__{humble pie. "thirty days in the hole." russell and band enter the radio station, passing through the now empty front office. as always, russell sets the tone. he's feeling good. stillwater takes over they feel mighty, like the beetles, as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold records and head down the small hallway to the control room interview. rolling with the flow are william and penny in her green coat. he tries to distance himself from her still a little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff but she will have none of it. she privately shares every great passing moment with him. he tries not to succumb to these charms. it's hard. music segues to stillwater's own "fever dog."}
