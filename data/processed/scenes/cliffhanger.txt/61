<L>__{interior the cave a little later close on gabe}
<A>__{gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass properly skinned and butchered off his knife blade. we can see from flickering shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave we pull back to see}
<B>__{the fire}
<A>__{which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills. it's safe to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and the fire's dying down. gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on the flame. gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat leg, and chews unhappily.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{mmm. just like chicken.}
<A>__{gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of jack daniel. it's going to have to last him. he has an entire rat to get through.}
