<D>__{okay, shorty ... see you in the morning...i'm going to have a little word with willie.}
<A>__{indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal instincts. he buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and grabs his leather jacket. as he puts on his jacket he walks past the life sized paintings of armed gaurds standing in silent vigil. suddenly we see something frightening behind him: one of the wall paintings sees to come to life! a large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and lifts a silk cord the figure wraps the cord suddenly around indiana's neck! the huge assassin stands behind indy, twisting the cord even tighter around his neck. as indy attempts to break free he sees the assassin's face is a mirror and a strange yellow light glowing in the killer's eyes.}
