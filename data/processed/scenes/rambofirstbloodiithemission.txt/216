<L>__{exterior prison camp vietnam afternoon}
<A>__{sgt. tay is sitting on the steps of the guard barracks, looking a bit like a lost soul. the sound of a rotor gets louder. a shadow falls upon him. he looks up squinting. a shape, an outline... in the glare of the sun. tay has a moment of apprehension. then...}
<L>__{exterior rambo's huey}
<A>__{rambo unleashes the minigun. the left guard tower vanishes in a cloud of falling splinters as thunder rolls across the valley. the huey pivots nimbly. the minigun roars again. an orange lightning bolt vaporizes the right tower.}
<B>__{various angles in camp}
<A>__{as the thunder fades. tay starts to run. the prisoners dive for cover. three off duty guards in the guards barracks go for their rifles. they don't make it. from rambo's pov the guards barracks seems to disintegrate as the minigun sweeps across it... a shock wave of destruction behind which only flying kindling remains. he pivots a last time and annihilates the sentry post with a one second burst. three guards have managed to take cover behind a truck by the main gate. they begin firing. low angle on the huey, a roaring silhouette in the metallic mist. the minigun speaks. the truck is ripped open like aluminum foil, shrapnel flying. the guards cease to exist. a spray of red mist and tattered scraps of uniforms settles to the ground. it is all over in seconds. the huey settles to earth in the center of the compound. tay, crouching, squints against the rotor blast. wild eyed, capt. vinh steps from his partially collapsed office and raises his side arm pistol. tay snatches it from him with a terrified cry and an expression which says: are you out of your fucking mind? the sgt. flings the pistol away and turns toward the huey. out of the boiling, blasting dust and smoke a figure}
<B>__{emerges.}
<A>__{to tay, rambo is death incarnate. he is encrusted with dried mud, dried blood, streaked with rivulets of sweat. his eyes burn. rambo has detached the door gun from its sling and, with the feed belt over one shoulder, carries it like a rifle. he motions with the muzzle. tay and vinh flop forward, face to the earth, hands laced behind their heads. rambo moves past them, eyeing the wreckage of the camp warily.}
