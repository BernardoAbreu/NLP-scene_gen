<L>__{exterior crawford's street later}
<A>__{jennifer drives her mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late afternoon light. she goes up the driveway of the crawfords' stark mordern home. across the street, mr. gifford is playing catch with his grandson. he waves to jennifer. she waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the front door.}
<L>__{interior crawford house living room continuous}
<A>__{cold. elegant. metal planters with bamboo trees. glass doors out to a back garden. a fire in the fireplace. in a corner is another of crawford's rube goldbergs this one the size of a refrigerator. on a coffee table in the center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball bearings. jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and freezes, startled. crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer "disarray", he is calm and focused.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you're home early.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i just felt a sudden urge.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{are you...okay?}
<A>__{crawford shrugs, smiling strangely. he looks pained.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i could use a hug.}
<A>__{jennifer submits guiltily. crawford embraces her, tight. she waits it out, until:}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{have you been drinking?}
<A>__{he lets go and she steps back. studying him. scared.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i've been watching you sleep. at night.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{that's creepy.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{sometimes when i'm at work, i will start thinking about you and i will just get just overwhelmed.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{tommy }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's a dense, crushing geophysical force. like i'm pinned. at the core where things change.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you ever get that way about me, jen?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm trying to describe my feelings.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{those don't sound like feelings.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's the sound of one feeling...in a forest?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you think you're so much smarter than i am. that must make you feel very powerful.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{helpless, actually.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{okay. maybe it's time to really talk.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{he shakes his head. frayed and worn, she sighs.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{fine. whatever. i will make you some dinner.}
<A>__{he watches her turn and head for the kitchen. to her back:}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i know. everything.}
<A>__{she stops, exhales. looking down. afraid. grateful it's happening at last.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{don't be. knowledge is pain. i'm used to that.}
<A>__{jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy. preparing herself to turn and end it, to grow, to move on.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's not like i don't let little pleasures, in return for the pain.}
<A>__{she frowns and turns and her eyes go big with fear. crawford is holding a semi automatic pistol, aimed at her face. very still. the gunshot explodes out of the muzzle bright, harsh, loud.}
