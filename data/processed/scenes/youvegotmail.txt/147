<D>__{soon we'll just be a memory. in fact, someone, some foolish person will probably think it's a tribute to this city, the way it keeps changing on you, the way you can never count on it, or something. i know, because that's the sort of thing i'm always saying. but the truth is, i'm heartbroken. i feel as if part of me has died, and my mother has died all over again, and no one can ever make it right.}
