<L>__{exterior moors by the sea fog day}
<A>__{it is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare. arthur with perceval at his side rides through the fog, searching. perceval takes up a challenge against the king. he unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance. he returns to the king's side.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{there are too many on mordred's side. we cannot hold out much longer.}
<A>__{kay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog. kay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath. he is amazed by what he sees. a knight, in old, battle scarred armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts. he fights without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his right. kay moves away in search of arthur. arthur and perceval watch the lone knight meting out death with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he can be no other.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{lancelot?... it is lancelot!}
<A>__{he spurs his horse forward to join him, but perceval is quick to stop him.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{no, my lord. we seek mordred.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i will join him.}
<A>__{kay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away.}
