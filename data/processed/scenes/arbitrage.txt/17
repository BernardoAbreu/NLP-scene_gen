<A>__{julie cote (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the exquisite space. it's the modern mirror of robert's mansion, the lines carried through fully this time. and julie is the modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home. she's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack of invitations for the "julie cote gallery paintings by victor rodriguez april 10th" as she downs the last of a white wine. she's got a seating chart out that she's working on. the intercom rings. julie heads over, sees robert's face on the video monitor. she holds a beat.}
