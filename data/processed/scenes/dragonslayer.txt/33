<A>__{dragon country day clouds scud low over the lifeless region. the dragon's lair now has a newer, bigger entrance. vapors drift upward from it. down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock to rock: it's valerian with a wicker basket on her arm, searching for dragon scales. the basket is already more than half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of the cavern. she's about to turn back when she spies a particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards further on. as she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss! she jerks her hand back and freezes. there in the shadows is a baby dragon, a basilisk, all coppery bronze with stubby winglets. as she backs away, she sees two more come up to join the first. they watch her retreat through wicked little green eyes.}
