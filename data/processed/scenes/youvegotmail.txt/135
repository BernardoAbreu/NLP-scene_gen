<L>__{interior joe's apartment later}
<A>__{the e mail from kathleen continues as joe reads.}
<C>__{kathleen }
<D>__{i was cruel, and i'm never cruel. and even though i can hardly believe what i said mattered to this man to him, i'm just a bug to be crushed but what if it did? no matter what he's done to me, there's no excuse for my behavior. anyway, you are my dear friend, and i so wanted to talk to you. i hope you have a good reason for not being there last night, but if you don't, and if we never really connect again, i just want to tell you how much it has meant to me to know you were there.}
<A>__{joe sits there a second. a moment of intense ambivalence. then he hits the menu key and signs off.}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{joe stands and leaves the room. the computer sits there. hold on the computer. we hear him open the refrigerator door. we hear him close the refrigerator door. he passes the den without even looking into it. a moment later he comes back into the room, stares at the computer. he starts for the bedroom, changes his mind. circles the computer. he's going to go cold turkey if it kills him. fuck it. he sits down. sign on. starts to type.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i am in vancouver.}
<A>__{he stops... hits the delete button and erases the message. he starts typing again:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i was stuck in a meeting, which i couldn't get out of it, and there was no phone.}
<A>__{he backspaces to erase "there was no phone." screen now reads: i was stuck in a meeting, which i couldn't get out of it. joe sits there thinking for a moment. then he starts typing.}
<P>__{joe (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{the electricity went out in the building and we were trapped on the 18th floor and the telephone system blew too.}
<A>__{he stops and looks at it. then he types:}
<P>__{joe (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{amazingly enough.}
<A>__{he sits looking at it. then he deletes the whole thing. sits looking at the blank screen.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{he clicks the yes box. then he starts to type again.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{dear friend: i cannot tell you what happened to me last night, but i beg you from the bottom of my heart to forgive me for not being there.}
<A>__{he deletes "for not being there." then types again, after "to forgive me".}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ for what happened. i feel terrible that you found yourself in a situation that caused you additional pain. but i'm absolutely sure that whatever you said last night was provoked, even deserved. and everyone says things they regret when they're worried or stressed. you were expecting to see someone you trusted and met the enemy instead. the fault is mine.}
