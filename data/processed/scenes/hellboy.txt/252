<A>__{hellboy painfully takes liz's limp body in his arms. myers stands by his side. he kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps. myers steps on something. he looks under his foot: a smashed glass eye. then... out of the silence, a whisper.}

<D>__{look what you've done }
<A>__{he looks up. in his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift lazily.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{you've killed me an insignificant man... but you have brought forth a god.}
<A>__{he uncovers his abdomen. long, fleshy pseudopods spill out of the wound, like intestines. a large entity erupts from grigory's torso and claws the air.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{behold, my master, behemoth. guardian of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.}
<A>__{covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi tentacled shape baby behemoth lands on the stone slab. the squirming flesh surges up like greasy pink foam. growing exponentially by the second. ilsa kneels and embraces grigory's corpse. kisses him on the mouth. a gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.}

<D>__{hell will hold no surprises for us.}
<A>__{a tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.}
