<L>__{exterior max's apartment dusk}
<A>__{max marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by devi's boyfriend, farrouhk. farrouhk is a little guy with a big sadistic smile. he grabs max by the collar and slams him against the wall. his fist butts up against max's chin.}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{there you go, dork. been thinking about my girlfriend. haven't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{wha...}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{you want to fuck her, don't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, no..}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{you calling my girlfriend ugly!? why don't you want to fuck her? you think she's ugly?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, no, i just. it's that she's your girl...}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{so you do want to fuck her. you think about fucking her in the mouth, don't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, no, sir, please. i've never touched devi...i never will.}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{give the fucking genius a mars bar. stay away, or i will slice off your balls.}
<A>__{farrouhk tosses max against the wall. max whimpers off to his apartment. farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be gives max a small slap on the butt. inside his apartment max bolts the front door. at his desk he rips open the envelope lenny meyer gave him. he pulls out a black disk and eyes it expectantly. next door, he hears farrouhk and devi talking.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{damn dork.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{he's just a bit unique.}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{unique?! unique?! he's a dork!}
<A>__{then, max carefully slips the disk into euclid's drive. hebrew characters pop onto euclid's screen. max pounds in several strings of code lightning fast. the hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts. max toggles between hebrew and numbers a few timesimpressed. max nods. then there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{max peeks through the peephole. two well dressed large men, brad and abe the babe, wait for the signal. max knocks and the suits leave. then max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the black attache case in front of his door donning a surgical mask and latex gloves, max opens the black attache case. sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip. max studies it with awe.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{friday, september fifth? lots of work to be done. but i'm close, so close. today is the day might have cost me my soul, but down the line i will work it out. just keep them in the dark, let them beg. a damn ming mecca chip. it's like giving a desperate junkie a syringe filled with junk. defense uses them to nun nuclear sub reactors. me? i'm going to dissect the market.}
<A>__{max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner euclid. he welds it into euclid's waiting wires.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{happy birthday, euclid.}
<A>__{then he lifts his hand to slap the return button, but a sudden wave of fear stops him. he gets up and grabs a ginseng soda from the fridge he drops eight pills in the can. he calmly takes a sip from the soda and places it on the counter. max can hear devi and farrouhk starting to make love. their gentle sounds drift through the wall.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{eighteen thirty. press return... max darts over and smacks the return. moments later we see what max sees}
<A>__{on the screen is a long string of zeros. at the bottom of the screen euclid's cursor blinks, waiting for instructions. he smacks return again max gets the same empty result. euclid's cursor blinks, waiting. max starts to laugh. he laughs and laughs and laughs.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh god. damn religious freaks.}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{the holy torah...}
<A>__{but then he notices his thumb twitching. he rubs his scar.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ah god...}
<A>__{his neighbor's love sounds start to get rough. they're having fun. max almost throws up.}
<B>__{the bathroom}
<A>__{max dry heaves in the sink. then he forces himself to stand in front of the mirror.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{too much...too soon.}
<A>__{he grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. he can't get it to roll up. suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. he quickly rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm. nothing happens. he checks the barrelits empty}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ohh...}
<A>__{he grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the sink. he cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. he loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. a wave of pain and nausea floods in. he grabs another bottle and fires it into his arm. then he fires another and another. frustrated he collapses into the mirror.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{stop, please, stop.}
<A>__{slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart. he sees something.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what the?}
<A>__{so he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair. meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. their screams carry into max's head. max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side of his head. he has uncovered a light scar on his head. he examines it in the mirror.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what is it!? what is it!?}
<A>__{then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. it sounds like sodom and gomorrah next door and max can barely stand it. a jolt of pain surges into his head. he grabs his scar as he vomits blood into the sink. he starts banging his head against the mirror. he bangs his head again and again until the mirror cracks! his neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted and agonizing. the mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. he reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, where the pain is coming from. max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off. suddenly the pain is gone. then he hears something. it's euclid, buzzing with life. he gets to his feet and head's into euclid. the main monitor is screaming with numbers. the lights in the room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. a filo substance billows out of euclid. and then a number pops onto the screen. max estimates how many digits are on the screen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{two...two hundred. that's it! that's it!}
<A>__{max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. he starts writing down the number. he mumbles each digit as he sees it. but then be stops writing. power surge! he stares at the number. something clicks in his head. his eyes go wide. he barely musters a}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{we move closer and closer into the number, deeper and deeper into the screen. until finally a single pixel fills the screen and we're in the blinding white void where we hear several deep peaceful breaths. then, a fuse blows and we cut to:}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{a phone ringing...once... twice...then we hear}
<C>__{mrs. ovadia}
<D>__{he's alive. his eyes are moving.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{yes, hello?}
