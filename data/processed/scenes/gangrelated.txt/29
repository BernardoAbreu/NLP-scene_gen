<L>__{exterior alley same time}
<A>__{james darts down the alley. narrow, dark, lined with trash bins. divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to catch him. james is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, skidding to a stop. rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at james. no where for him to go. he slows down. rodriguez moves in from his front, divinci runs up from behind. james is disgusted.}
