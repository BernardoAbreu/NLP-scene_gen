<L>__{exterior dock area day}
<A>__{we open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood and gore. as the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin pole hoist dockside, meadows is seen passing with his secretary and a photographer from the amity gazette. a crowd of returning fishermen from the armada and townspeople are gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail up into the classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{ginny, get this out on the state wire to ap and upi in boston and new york. have one of them pick it up for the national and call dave axelrod in new york and tell him this is from me and he owes me one... let's get a picture.}
<A>__{as he and the photographer turn to mob, we see hooper and brody arriving from the morgue. hooper immediately heads towards the shark, while brody pauses and we see a look of relief and delight cross his features.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then i guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day beginner's luck.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(crossing to men around shark)}
<D>__{you did it! did ben gardner catch this?}
<A>__{men ad lib "no, i caught it..." "i hooked him," etc.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{okay, everybody, i want to get a picture for the paper could everyone clear out of the way?}
<A>__{he continues to call directions and move people out of the way to set up his shot. hooper is measuring the shark.}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{could you get out of the shot, young man?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{who, me? okay...}
<P>__{(he drifts off)}
<A>__{the men (felix, pratt, et al) get brody to join them in the shot. the whole town and the armada fishermen all line up in a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the armada and townspeople arranged behind them. hendricks hold up the "beach closed" sign in ironic victory.}
<B>__{angle showing vaughn approaching the dock}
<A>__{brody spots the mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches himself from the group to join him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. but they got him!}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{that's good. that's real good. ben meadows getting pictures for the paper.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{sure he is.}
<B>__{hooper and the fishermen}
<A>__{the men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, debating something with hooper, who is dwarfed by the big beer bellies and ham fisted hands all around him. it's probable we don't even see him. the men ad lib "what kind of shark is this?" "it's a shark like in the movies they got sharks." "it's a man eater, for sure." "i bet it's a record breaker," etc.}
<C>__{hooper }
<D>__{it's a tiger shark. very rare in these waters, and definitely a maneater.}
<A>__{hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, measuring the shark's teeth. others watch him. charlie and denherder walk over to the shark. charlie punches it.}
<B>__{brody and vaughn}
<A>__{they are walking down to the shark together.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{who's that young man?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{matt hooper, the specialist they send down from the oceanographic institute.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(speaking to everyone)}
<D>__{i think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.}
<A>__{brody and vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, who are surrounding hooper, raising their voices at him.}
<C>__{pratt}
<D>__{whadya mean, 'bite radius?' what's that?}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{teeth are teeth, right?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i didn't say this wasn't the shark, i just said i wasn't sure this was the one...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what d'ya mean?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{there are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white tips... any one of them could've attacked. look shark digestion is slow. we could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{that's disgusting! this is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off amity island, and a known maneater!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{let's just cut him open and see what's inside...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{why not, larry? we could get a positive confirmation that way.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{be reasonable, boys this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half assed autopsy on a fish. ben...}
<P>__{(to meadows)}
<D>__{do you have all the pictures you need?}
<C>__{meadows}
<D>__{plenty.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{felix, pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "you're not gonna cut up my trophy," etc.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(seeing something}
<D>__{offstage, with low}
<P>__{intensity)}
<D>__{i am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock. besides...}
<P>__{(he indicates off)}
<A>__{we see mrs. kintner approaching, dressed in black.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{chief, i will take responsibility for this. boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. harve, tomorrow you and carl take him out and dump him right in the drink.}
<B>__{mrs. kintner joins the group}
<A>__{she seeks out brody, and stops in front of him.}
<C>__{mrs. kintner}
<D>__{chief brody?}
<A>__{he nods, she slaps him full across the face. there is an embarrassed silence. some people leave, following a trend that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.}
<C>__{mrs. kintner}
<D>__{my alex was a beautiful little boy and you killed him. did you know that? you knew there was a shark out there. you knew a girl got killed here last week. i just found that out. but you knew. you knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway. you knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that. my boy is dead. i wanted you to know that.}
<A>__{she stops, unable to continue. her father takes her arm and leads her away. pratt, harry and the others trail off after her. during the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on brody to the exclusion of the others.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i'm sorry, martin. she's in a sick, terrible state.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but i'm not sure...}
<A>__{before hooper can finish, brody's shoulders slump and he goes slack.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{she's right.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{let's all get out of here, this place stinks.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<A>__{he turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to vaughn and hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis admiration.}
