<L>__{exterior courtyard day}
<A>__{tommy conceals himself behind a pillar, across the court yard, away from the guests. but from another direction, johnson and andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a bench by the pillar.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{olaf, there's something i wanted to sound you out on. as a special friend.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{shoot.}
<A>__{tommy moves away from the pillar, sees bruno roaming the terrace, and retreats.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{i'm thinking of retiring from congress.}
<A>__{andersen's eyes widen in astonishment.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{you're what?}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{i'm thinking maybe i won't run. maybe i should listen more}
<P>__{(indicating his heart)}
<D>__{to this. really appreciate these years. sail around the world. climb mountains. enjoy the finer things of life.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{jeff. listen to me. you can't retire. florida needs you. i need you. i need you on rates. i need you on regulations. i need you on those environmental nutcases }
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{olaf, if i retire this year, i get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury. comes to a very tidy nest egg.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{how tidy?}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{one point three million.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{it's called the grandfather loophole.}
<A>__{bruno has gone. but tommy stays. his eyes light up at the money.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{come on, jeff. look at what you'd be giving up. going to the best resorts in the world and calling it "official business." golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking up a tab. and, jeff there's no aphrodisiac like power. you can have some of the most intelligent, attractive women in the country. you've got it made!}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{oh, i suppose that one point three may seem like spare change to the head of gulf coast power, but to a country boy like me }
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{okay, jeff. i get it. look. there's a little software company that's about to go through the roof.}
<A>__{johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is taking. on tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction going down.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{a few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile. as long as your blind trust buys them, you're clean the sec can't shake a stick at you. half a million, easy and that's just a start.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{well, if you put it like that... i now see i have a duty to continue my career in public service.}
<A>__{johnson stands, puts his arm on andersen. tommy emerges, shakes his head, and laughs.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i'm in the wrong business.}
