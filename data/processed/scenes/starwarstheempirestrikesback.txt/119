<L>__{exterior space luke's x wing}
<A>__{luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet. soon it disappears into the stars.}
<L>__{interior luke's x wing cockpit}
<A>__{luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision. he flips several switches. the stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn. the x wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction. the monitor screen on luke's control panel prints out a question from the concerned artoo.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong, artoo. i'm just setting a new course.}
<A>__{artoo beeps once again.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{we're not going to regroup with the others.}
<A>__{artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "what?!" luke reads artoo's exclamation on his control panel.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{we're going to the dagobah system.}
<A>__{luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments. he rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence. finally, artoo chirps up.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{yes, artoo?}
<A>__{artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink, chuckling)}
<D>__{that's all right. i'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.}
<A>__{the little droid lets out a defeated whimper. luke smiles, and continues on his course.}
