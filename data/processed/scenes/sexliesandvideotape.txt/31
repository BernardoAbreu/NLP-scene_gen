<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{questions about sex.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, like what did he ask, exactly?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, like, i don't want to tell you, exactly.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{apparently.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{did he ask you to take your clothes off?}
<C>__{cytnhia}
<D>__{did he ask me to take my clothes off? no, he didn't.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{did you take your clothes off?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(floored)}
<D>__{cynthia!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{because i wanted to.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but why did you want to?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i wanted him to see me.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? he could be...bouncing it off some satellite or something. some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you don't know that for sure.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, it's too late now, isn't it?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{did he touch you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no, but i did.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you touched him?}
<C>__{cytnhia}
<D>__{no, i touched me.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{wait a minute. do you mean...don't tell me you...in front of him.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{in front of him, ann, yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{you are in trouble.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{listen to you!! you sound like mom. what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{i can t believe you did that!!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i mean, i couldn't do that in front of john, even.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you couldn't do it, period.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you know what i mean, you don't even know him!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i feel like i do.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{that doesn't mean you do. you can't possibly trust him, he's...perverted.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he's harmless. he just sits around and looks at these tapes. what's the big deal?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{so he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? that doesn't make you feel weird?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no. i don't think they all did what i did.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you are in serious trouble.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ann, i don't understand why this freaks you out so much. you didn't do it, i did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't want to discuss it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{then why do you keep asking about it?}
