<D>__{lerner! lerner, can you hear me man?}
<A>__{lerner groans. a fresh burst of ak fire rakes the area. lerner jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds. chris spots the sniper. in a hole in the ground. twenty five meters off. snapping the magazine out of his ak to reload. a live gook. chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the hole. this is the moement, chris realizes it, it's now or never if chris intends to get the gook. he's got to make a move before the man has reloaded his weapon. he pulls his grenade, pops the pin. he lets the spoon fly off, activating the grenade timer, as he humps to his feet and runs for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating. that head is going to pop up any second with a freshly loaded weapon and tear his head off. chris won't make it back to the hole. the throw has to be perfect. he won't get another chance. he heaves the frag, drops and rolls away. the throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner. it twists cleanly in the hole. the explosion muffled but deadly. chris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surprise on his face. he can't seem to believe he did it. pointing his m 16 before him, he advances on the hole, looking over the muzzle to see the badly mangled nva man twisted at the bottom. chris hurries over to lerner. he's in bad shape, hit in several places, vaguely conscious.}
