<L>__{exterior hospital building night}
<A>__{she is unconscious. she swings twelve stories above the pavement. the camera follows up her arm to her hand grasped tightly by alan's hand. we continue up to alan.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia! open your eyes! open your eyes!}
<A>__{he is over the railing holding on with his other hand. cynthia is coming to.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{pull up! pull yourself up so i can got a grip on you!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let me go.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let me go. i saw it. it's beautiful.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you didn't see shit! hold on!}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{eternal bliss.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes! i want to go! let me go!}
<C>__{berrisford}
<P>__{(coming forward)}
<D>__{let her go. she needs it.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no! cynthia, harris doesn't exist! he's dead! look at who that is! look at him! look!}
<A>__{cynthia looks at berrisford deliriously. he changes from berrisford to harris with each flash. he comes to the railing where alan is holding on. almost politely, he tries to undo alan's grip.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{goddamn you! goddamn you!}
<A>__{alan's grip on cynthia slips down to her fingers.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{let her go. let her go and i will forget your disobedience.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{you can stay one with me in the psychosis and cult behavior study. we'll publish our findings together }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{publish this, asshole!}
<A>__{alan swings one leg up, kicks berrisford in the groin. berrisford howls and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks. snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at alan's hand.}
<C>__{alan }
<P>__{(to cynthia)}
<D>__{don't you hear him? he's trying to bribe me but i'm not letting go! i will go with you, but i'm not letting go!}
<A>__{berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. he aims unsteadily... shoots. alan yanks himself out of the way. berrisford misses. berrisford moves closer. raises the g= barrel at point black range towards alan's hand.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{cynthia, help us! help us both!}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{you'll be with them, dr. goldman, be happy.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{s...stop it... stop it!}
<A>__{berrisford shoots. one of alan's finger joints is blown away. he screams, his grip loosens, and he slides down the railing. berrisford moves several yards to stay close... begins to pound on alan's mutilated hand.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia, don't let him kill you! don't let him do this!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{unity... it... it's my destiny... i've fought it too long. right or wrong... my death has a purpose... it will close the book. end the story.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! you're part of my life now. that's an unfinished story, too...}
<A>__{she looks at berrisford viciously pounding on alan's hand.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let me up. stop it.}
<A>__{she starts to climb up, but she can't.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{let me up!}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{i'm afraid it's too late for that.}
<A>__{alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. they crack. she yells from the pain. she swings in the breeze. alan is weakening. he is losing consciousness. he knows he is about to die.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{dr. berrisford?}
<A>__{suddenly berrisford freezes. he is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up the stairs. berrisford backs away glaring. alan groans. the guard rushes over.}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{jesus}
<P>__{(yelling down the stairs)}
<D>__{gomez, get up here!}
<A>__{the other guard appears. they start helping alan up by pulling his arm. as they help him up, berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the wall. he leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head. he trembles. he pulls the trigger.}
<B>__{click.}
<A>__{click, click, click. out of bullets. the others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. just as they pull cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see: berrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly. silently.}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{cynthia numbly watches him fall. then she in pulled up and over...}
