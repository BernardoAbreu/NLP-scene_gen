<L>__{exterior townhouse garden washington, d.c. afternoon}
<A>__{an afternoon in late november, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches. the garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall. at one end stands the rear of a three story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building. classical music is heard in the distance. a man, handsomely dressed in a well tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden. a gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. he works slowly, precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings. this man is called chance. chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time. he looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket. as chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork.}
<L>__{interior garage afternoon}
<A>__{the sound of the music increases as chance enters the garage from the garden. a gleaming 1921 touring car is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall. chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf, carefully puts it over the car. when he finishes covering the car for the night, chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the garage through a side entry.}
<L>__{interior potting room afternoon}
<A>__{the potting room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion. rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. a small, 1940's table model black and white tv rests on a shelf. it is playing, tuned to the boston pops orchestra. attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels. the wheels spins, creates an early form of color tv. as chance enters, his attention is on the television set. he watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away. chance turns off the tv and leaves the room, but the sound of the boston pops continues.}
<L>__{interior chance's room afternoon}
<A>__{a room adjacent to the potting room. a large screen remote control color television set dominates the room. it is on, tuned to the boston pops. in contrast to the new tv, the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties. there are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen. chance comes in, watches the tv with a detached gaze as he removes his apron. he changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag. he takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality. chance changes the channel once again.}
<L>__{exterior garden night}
<A>__{chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.}
<L>__{interior main house rear entrance hallway night}
<A>__{the interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the warmth of oak. white dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture. chance enters, walks through the hallway.}
<L>__{interior main house dining room night}
<A>__{a large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs. it is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered. a small portable color tv is next to the place setting. chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway. he sits at the dining room table, turns on the tv, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen. louise, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and chance's clean laundry.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(sets dinner before chance)}
<D>__{... evening, chance.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(slowly, perfect diction, no accent of any kind)}
<D>__{... good evening, louise.}
<A>__{louise sets chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks up his laundry bag.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{... the old man is getting weaker, chance.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(begins to eat)}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...}
<A>__{chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the tv as he eats. a buzzer sounds, louise looks upstairs.}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{... back up those stairs damn... that man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(still watches tv)}
<D>__{is his back feeling better?}
<A>__{louise gives chance a look.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{... gobbledegook... you and your gobbledegook. you're gonna be the death of me yet, chance...}
<P>__{(she turns to leave)}
<D>__{... unless those stairs are... the good lord's liable to snatch up two unwillin' souls at the same time if i keep on trampin' up those stairs... i don't want none of that...}
<A>__{louise disappears through the doorway. chance continues to eat and watch tv.}
<L>__{interior chance's room dawn}
<A>__{chance is asleep, lying on his back. his eyes slowly open, and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on the tv with the remote control. chance gets out of bed, goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer, checks the time. he crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television. he puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room.}
<L>__{interior potting room dawn}
<A>__{chance enters, turns on the tv with the spinning color wheel, then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. he turns off the tv and exits.}
<L>__{interior garage dawn}
<A>__{chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. he leaves the garage.}
<L>__{interior chance's room dawn}
<A>__{chance returns to his room, changes channels on the television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the closet, then goes into the bathroom.}
<L>__{exterior garden morning}
<A>__{a light snow is falling. the door to the small building opens, chance peeks out, then goes back inside. a few seconds pass and chance reappears, this time with an umbrella. smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main house.}
<L>__{interior main house rear entrance hallway morning}
<A>__{chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering. he hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then heads for the dining room.}
<L>__{interior dining room morning}
<A>__{repeating his ritual, chance enters the dining room, sits, turns on the tv, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. he watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting louise. she doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches tv. after a few beats, chance hears louise's footsteps hurrying down the stairs. she comes into the dining room, visibly distraught. chance looks up, smiles.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{good morning, louise.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{he's dead, chance! the old man's dead!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(flatly, turns back to tv)}
<D>__{... i see.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{must of happened durin' the night, i don't know... lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. i touched him, just to see, and you believe me, chance that's doin' more than i get paid to do... then i just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes. i've seen that done.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. he just said, 'yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' lord, what a mornin'!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(watches news, flashes of season's first snowfall)}
<D>__{... yes, louise, it's snowing in the garden today. have you looked outside and seen the snow? it's very white.}
<A>__{a beat of silence from louise, then anger.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{dammit, boy! is that all you got to say? more gobbledegook?}
<P>__{(chance smiles, is silent)}
<D>__{that old man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(with a smile, accepting death)}
<D>__{yes, louise. i have seen it often. it happens to old people.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{well, ain't that the truth...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<A>__{louise throws back the cover from a chair next to chance and sits, softening a bit toward him.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{oh, lord, chance i don't know what i was expectin' from you... i'm sorry for yellin' like i did... no sir, i just don't know what i was expectin' ...}
<P>__{(chance doesn't react, watches tv)}
<D>__{... i 'spose i'd better gather up some breakfast for you...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(a turn to her)}
<D>__{yes, i'm very hungry.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(rises, looks upstairs)}
<D>__{well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', i guess...}
<P>__{(she starts out, stops by the door)}
<D>__{... what are you goin' to do now, chance?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(gazing at tv)}
<D>__{i'm going to work in the garden.}
<A>__{louise gives chance a long look, then turns to leave.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{... i will get you some eggs.}
<A>__{chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the tv.}
<L>__{interior main house servant's stairway morning}
<A>__{an enclosed stairway. chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior main house upstairs hallway morning}
<A>__{chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase. he moves off down the hall.}
<L>__{interior main house old man's room morning}
<A>__{the furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the old man is. there is a polite knock at the door, then chance enters the room. as chance moves slowly to the old man's bed, we sense a feeling of respect from chance, as well as a bit of curiosity. chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the old man's face. he touches the man's forehead, lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. chance moves to the tv (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. he sits in an easy chair next to the old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties. chance puts an arm out, rests it on the old man's covered body. with the other, he changes the channels with the remote control. he returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady. the scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.}
<L>__{exterior garden morning}
<A>__{it has stopped snowing. chance, wearing a hat, the gardening apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. louise comes out of the main house. she is dressed warmly, a scarf over her head, a heavy coat. chance sees her, tips his hat to louise exactly like the man he saw on television.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{... well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{... gotta go now, chance...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(resumes working)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...}
<P>__{(he keeps working)}
<D>__{... you oughta find yourself a lady, chance...}
<P>__{(she smiles slightly, with caring)}
<D>__{but i guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...}
<P>__{(she reaches out, puts a hand on his shoulder)}
<D>__{... you're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?}
<P>__{(he smiles, keeps working)}
<D>__{... goodbye, chance...}
<A>__{louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward the house.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{goodbye, louise.}
<A>__{louise waves as she enters the townhouse. chance tips his hat once again as she disappears.}
<L>__{interior main house front hallway morning}
<A>__{louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases waiting by the door. she stops as she sees two men in white carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. she notices the ease with which they bring the old man's body down the stairs.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{... he used to be a big man... 'spose he wasted away to about nothin'...}
<P>__{(a beat then she talks}
<D>__{to the body of the old}
<P>__{man)}
<D>__{... i guess i will be goin' off to find me some folks, old man... i'm not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer...}
<A>__{the stretcher bearers move to the front door. louise steps in front of them.}
<C>__{louise }
<P>__{(to stretcher bearers)}
<D>__{wait up! i'm goin' out that door first.}
<A>__{louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens the front door, leaves.}
<L>__{interior chance's room day}
<A>__{the tv plays offstage as chance washes up in the bathroom. he finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves the room.}
<L>__{exterior garden day}
<A>__{chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of fresh snow to the townhouse.}
<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place. he turns on the tv, puts the napkin on his lap. he watches tv for a moment, then turns, looks for louise. she does not appear so he resumes watching tv. he changes channels, views a wildly exciting football game. at a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels. chance watches tv news coverage of the president of the united states greeting foreign dignitaries at the white house. close shots on television reveal that the president uses a two handed handshake when meeting his guests. unconsciously, chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on tv seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind.}
<L>__{interior townhouse front hallway day}
<A>__{a key is heard in the lock. the door opens and thomas franklin and sally hayes enter. franklin, an attorney, is in his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. hayes is younger, attractive, also an attorney. she totes a briefcase, has the look of a modern, liberated woman. hayes appears to be surprised at the interior of the house.}
<C>__{hayes}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{... this is another world, tom i never would have believed it...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{yeah... he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... fox hunting... before i was born...}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{... would you take me on a tour?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{gladly...}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{... the safe is in mr. jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.}
<A>__{franklin puts a hand on hayes' shoulder as they,go off down the hall.}
<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{chance still watches tv, waits for louise to serve him. franklin and hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room. they are both surprised to see chance.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{... why... hello, we thought we heard something...}
<P>__{(moves to chance, hand outstretched)}
<D>__{i'm thomas franklin.}
<A>__{chance remains seated, takes franklin's hand warmly in both of his like the president did on tv.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{hello, thomas... i'm chance, the gardener.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... the gardener?}
<P>__{(thinks it's a joke, laughs)}
<D>__{... yes, of course... mr. chance, this is ms. hayes.}
<A>__{hayes moves to shake chance's hand.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{mr. chance, i'm very pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(doesn't rise, again shakes with both hands)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{chance turns back to the tv and hayes and franklin exchange looks.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(after an uneasy pause)}
<D>__{... we're with franklin, jennings and roberts, the law firm handling the estate.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(a smile, totally at ease)}
<D>__{yes, thomas i understand.}
<A>__{another period of silence. franklin and hayes seem perplexed.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{... are you waiting for someone? an appointment?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i'm waiting for my lunch.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{your lunch? you have a luncheon appointment here?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. louise will bring me lunch.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{louise?... the maid?...}
<P>__{(a look to hayes)}
<D>__{but she should have left earlier today...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(smiles at hayes)}
<D>__{i see...}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... you've quite a sense of humor, mr. chance but all kidding aside, may i ask just what you are doing here?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i live here.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{you live here?}
<P>__{(a look to hayes)}
<D>__{... we don't have any record of that.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it's very cold outside today, isn't it, thomas?}

<C>__{chance}
<D>__{oh. thank you.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{do you have any proof of your employment, mr. chance any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{compensated...?}

<D>__{how were you paid?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i was given meals, and a home...}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{what about money?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i never needed money.}
<A>__{franklin steps to the tv, turns it off.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{mr. chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address a driver's license, a credit card, checkbook?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, i do not have any of those.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{then how about medical records? could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i have no need for a doctor or dentist. i have never been ill. i have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for joe, i have never had any visitors.}
<C>__{franklin}

<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{mr. chance, that was twenty seven years ago.}

<D>__{yes and the old man used to come to my garden. he would read and rest there.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{come now, mr. jennings had been bedridden for thirty five years, since he fractured his spine.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, thomas, that is correct. then he stopped visiting my garden.}
<C>__{franklin}
