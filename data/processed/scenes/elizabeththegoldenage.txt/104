<L>__{interior queen's private quarters night}
<A>__{elizabeth is alone, pacing slowly, reading a book the consolation of philosophy, by boethius. she reads, pauses, looks into the far distance; then reads and walks again.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{`think you that there is any certainty in the affairs of mankind, when you know that one swift hour can destroy the greatest among us?'}
<A>__{she turns, and there is raleigh. she holds up her book.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{boethius.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{the consolation of philosophy.}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{may the lord god preserve england's queen.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{the same god in whose name philip wages his holy war. philip is a righteous man, and righteous men love to destroy. they burn whole worlds to make them pure, and leave behind ashes.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{he'll not burn england.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he may. his armada is invincible, they say. if london falls, i fall. if england is lost, i am lost.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{never!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{never? it's night. my thoughts turn dark. don't you ever think that one day, perhaps one day soon, you too will die?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{the closer i come to death, the more i want to live. the hungrier i am for life.}
<A>__{his defiant energy breaks elizabeth's morbid mood.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you're right. we must live while we can.}
<C>__{raleigh}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i've never known a woman like you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{in some other time, in some other world, could you have loved me?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i know only one world. in this world, i have loved you.}
<A>__{elizabeth smiles a small smile.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{then there's... something you could do for me something i've not known for a very long time if you felt so inclined }
<A>__{raleigh intuits what she wants. he comes closer as she speaks.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{something not to be spoken of afterwards to be forgotten but just for now }
<A>__{she lifts her head to his. she meets his eyes.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{a kiss?}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms, and they kiss. one kiss to hold all that might have been, all that they both know can never be. when at last they part she turns away from him, head bowed, eyes still closed, holding on to the sweet moment.}
