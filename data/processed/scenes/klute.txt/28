<A>__{it had once been a boutique that sold happy clothes. there are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity. klute's suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter. the ceilings are low, forcing klute to stoop as he enters. he seems out of place and out of scale. a case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor. on the table are a folder of klute's notes, and a paper bag. klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in. from the paper bag he sets aside an electric fan, then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin alarm clock and begins winding it.}
