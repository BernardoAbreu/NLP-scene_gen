<L>__{exterior dundalk home backyard day}
<A>__{close on: happy birthday mom written across a cake. as the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: anna and conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from maya anna's mom. as maya refills her glass from a bottle of wine, anna grabs a gift from her bag hands it to her mom.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh sweetie you didn't have to get me anything.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{mom you always say that and i always get you something.}
<A>__{maya takes a big sip of wine (not her first) as she tears open the gift, which is clearly a record album.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{you didn't.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's no big deal.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{maya shows him the album tim buckley's starsailor.}
<C>__{conor }
<D>__{tim buckley. nice.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{here put on my favorite.}
<A>__{anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{did anna ever tell you i knew tim buckley?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{no. she did not.}
<A>__{"song to the siren" plays as anna returns to the table.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{we met at a coffee shop in 1971. hell's kitchen. i had no idea who he was. but he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time. complete interest and disinterest. it was amazing.}
<A>__{maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{of course, i was with anna's father at the time, so, you know...another opportunity missed.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{mom, please }
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{it's the truth. i knew them all. robert plant, harry nilsson, graham parsons...}
<P>__{(to conor)}
<D>__{have you seen the pictures of me from when i was anna's age?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{umm i don't think so }
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{sweetie go get that picture you know the one }
<A>__{anna just looks at her pleadingly.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{go. your mother's asking you to do something for her on her birthday.}
<A>__{anna goes inside. maya looks to conor, takes a sip.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{you'll see we look strikingly similar. my lips may be a bit fuller, but...}
<A>__{she leans back, puts out her cigarette as anna returns with a picture. she hands it to conor. insert: maya, in her early twenties. black and white somewhere in new york. the resemblance to anna is scary.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{wow. that's unbelievable.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so that's what we're dealing with here, for reference. imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop.}
<A>__{conor looks down at the picture, then back up to anna.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{that's funny, because, i mean, i guess i kinda did. anna and i met at a restaurant. that serves coffee. so, not a coffee shop, but...still }
<A>__{he looks from maya to anna. maya stands up.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{that's sweet. but if we're comparing stories }
<P>__{(indicating with her glass)}
<D>__{she's no me and you're no tim buckley.}
<A>__{with that, maya heads inside.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{anyone need a refill?}
<A>__{anna looks to conor apologetically. he just smiles.}
