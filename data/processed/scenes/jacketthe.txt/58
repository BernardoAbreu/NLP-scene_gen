<A>__{as she makes their drinks, a curious look crosses her face, just for a second.}
<L>__{interior living room, waitress' apartment, a little while later}
<A>__{they've sat down to eat under the blinking christmas lights.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{this is pretty good. considering...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they eat quietly for a second. starks looks at her, then down at his food, still subtly stunned by it all.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{so you're a waitress, right? i mean...from the uniform you were wearing.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{yup. that's me.}
<C>__{starks}

<C>__{starks}
<D>__{have you always been a waitress? waitress [remembering sadly] no. i used to be a nurse.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] why'd you stop?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{shit happens, and your life changes. 'bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [beat] so how come you don't know where you're coming from?}

<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{maybe. [beat] maybe not.}
<A>__{she holds up her glass somewhat sadly.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{sometimes i don't know the difference myself. and, you know something? i think i like it better that way. [finishes her drink] you want another one?}
<A>__{she goes to the kitchen, and starks clears their plates.}
