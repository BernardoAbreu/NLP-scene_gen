<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but martin follows them.}

<D>__{a gun. rather than a knife.}
<A>__{he gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of blomkvist's jeans. there are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you just couldn't stay away, could you.}
<A>__{blomkvist doesn't know what to say. martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i want to show you something. bring your drink. leave the knife.}
<A>__{blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now. he pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table.}
