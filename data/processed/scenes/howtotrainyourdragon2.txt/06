<D>__{what? why?!}
<A>__{hiccup, astrid, gobber, and toothless chase after stoick.}

<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{no dragon or viking sets foot off this island until i give the word!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?}
<A>__{stoick turns to hiccup, gravely serious.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{because drago bludvist is a madman. without conscience or mercy. and if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all.}
<A>__{stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving hiccup stewing.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{get them into their pens! quickly!}
<A>__{hiccup chases around to confront stoick.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{then let's ride back out there. we'll follow those trappers to drago and talk some sense into him.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{no. we fortify the island.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{it's our duty to keep the peace!}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{peace is over, hiccup. i must prepare you for war.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{war? dad, if drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. let's go find him and change his mind.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{some minds won't be changed, hiccup. berk is what you need to worry about.}

<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hiccup, don't.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i have to.}
<A>__{he gives her a quick peck on the cheek.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{this way! quickly!}
<A>__{hiccup and toothless blast past, heading for the exit.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{hiccup!}
<A>__{they try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{toothless spins around and dives through the gap in the second lowering storm door.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{hiccup!}
<A>__{astrid and stormfly blow past stoick and slip through the storm door before it shuts, leaving stoick fuming.}
