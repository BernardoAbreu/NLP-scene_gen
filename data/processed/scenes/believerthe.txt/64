<L>__{interior sanctuary night}
<A>__{straightening up, danny is stunned by a vision: the open ark the torahs ...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. and steroid excess, lifting one out. danny reacts with an instinctive horror.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what are you doing? put that down! ...put it back in there.}
<A>__{steroid cowed by danny starts to obey, but before he can...}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{what do you care?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i don't, but...}
<C>__{billings}
<P>__{(vaults onto the stage)}
<D>__{let's look at the fucking thing.}
<A>__{each curse makes danny wince, but he just hovers about nervously as billings and steroid try to unwrap the torah while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in tallises.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{put it there, on the...}
<A>__{he indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(indicating crowns, the yod...)}
<D>__{just be careful with the...}
<C>__{o.l.}
<P>__{(puts a crown on his head)}
<D>__{"if i were king of the forest...not prince, not duke, not earl..."}
<A>__{danny cannot endure this desecration, but everyone else laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{open it up.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(impulsively taking over)}
<D>__{here...}
<A>__{he shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the torah. low murmurs at the sight of the broad columns, the mysterious calligraphy, the crackling parchment. danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred texterior over this...}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{oooo... weird... you read it from right to left.... the letters look like squashed bugs.... what kind of paper is that?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's not paper, it's parchment. it's made from sheepskin. and all the letters are drawn by hand.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{neat calligraphy.}
<A>__{danny nods, then, as if against his will....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's called the flame alphabet. it's supposed to be the word of god written in fire.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{fire...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{cool.}
<A>__{danny sees drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{how come you know all this shit?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how come you don't know it?}
<P>__{(pressing the advantage)}
<D>__{how can you say you hate the jews when you don't know anything about }
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no, you don't.... if you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. you know what tefillin is? tsitsis? shotness? you know the kaddish from the kiddush?}
<P>__{(obviously not)}
<D>__{eichmann? he went to israel. he studied the torah, the talmud, the mishnah, the whole bit. he hated jews.}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{who's eichmann?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who's eichmann?!!?}
<A>__{danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the others know why eichmann was.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{he was head of the gestapo's jewish sector. he deported people to the camps.}
<C>__{carleton}
<P>__{(reaching toward the parchment)}
<D>__{can we touch it?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, but not on the letters.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{why the fuck not?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(warning finger)}
<D>__{just don't.}
<A>__{billings bristles at danny's authority; carleton says to him...}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{didn't you see raiders of the lost ark?}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{what??}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{that was an ark, man. that was a torah. they fucked around with it, and the torah melted their faces.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{that's a movie, you moron.}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{fine, go ahead. touch the letters.}
<A>__{the others are gathered around, delicately touching the sheepskin.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{let me see.}
<A>__{he pushes through, looks at the torah. he runs his fingers over the crinkled parchment, the smooth black letters.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i said not on the }
<A>__{suddenly billings grabs the parchment in both hands and tries to tear it. it's tougher than it looks.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{stop it! what are you doing?}
<A>__{he tries to stop him, but accidentally or not drake gets in the way, and before danny can do anything else, billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash into the scroll. this produces a strange effect on the others. some (kyle, steroid, drake) join in. they knock the aitz off the bema, it rolls out, exposing ten feet of torah. they stamp on it, spit on it.... others (carleton, o.l.), though less troubled than danny, are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own revulsion at these acts. danny watches helplessly, like the survivor who did nothing as his son was murdered. finally the torah lies torn and soiled on the stage. a strange silence.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{...danny kneels by the torah. with a tallis, he attempts to clean the parchment. carleton and o.l. help him roll it onto the aitz. [echo "christ taken down from cross" with torah as christ.] they replace the cover, the yod, the crowns.... finally danny lifts it up, holds it to him as if it were his dead child. he closes his eyes, murmurs to himself....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{nothing. let's go....}
<A>__{he starts to walk out, carrying the torah.}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{why are you taking that?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'm stealing it.}
