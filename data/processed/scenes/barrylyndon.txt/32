<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{a little later on, as i rode towards kilcullen, i saw a crowd of peasant people assembled round a one horse chair, and my friend in green, as i thought, making off half a mile up the hill.}
<A>__{a footman howls, at the top of his voice.}
<C>__{footman}
<D>__{stop thief!}
<A>__{but the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just befallen.}
<D>__{country fellow #1 sure, you might have kept him off with your blunderbush! country fellow #2 o the coward! to let the captain bate you, and he only one eye! country fellow #3 the next time my lady travels, she'd better leave you at home!}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{what is this noise, fellows?}
<A>__{roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his whip, and bids the red shanked ruffians keep off. pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance to the chair window.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{what has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{oh, i am grateful to you, sir. i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin. my chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck." country fellow #1 sure, he's the friend of the poor, and good luck to him. country fellow #2 was it any business of ours?}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.}
<P>__{(to mrs. o'reilly)}
<D>__{have you lost much?}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{everything my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff boxes, watches. and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...}
<C>__{footman}
<D>__{be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much. didn't he return you the thirteen pence in copper, and the watch, saying it was only pinchbeck?}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{don't be insolent, or i will report you to the captain.}
<C>__{footman}
<D>__{sorry, ma'am.}
<A>__{he shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction that the captain has vanished.}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{that fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred pound bill, which was in the pocket book that the fellow took from me.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i am riding to dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{but i shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, mister...?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{o'higgins... mohawk o'higgins.}
