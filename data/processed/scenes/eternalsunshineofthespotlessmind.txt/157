<A>__{the old woman and her chair lift out of the line of commuters.}
<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{it's modern and well appointed. the old woman enters, sits behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the drawer. she takes some pills with water. an old man enters.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{how are you today, mary?}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{let's see... still dying, howard.}
<C>__{old man }
<D>__{you don't have to jump down my throat. i was trying to be nice.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{well, don't try. it's unbecoming on you.}
<A>__{old howard mutters something and disappears into the back. old mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc, places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and listens, somewhat wearily but attentively. we watch the color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording. another old woman enters the office. old mary looks up, seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.}
<D>__{old woman (mary) (cont'd) may i help you?}
<C>__{second old woman}
<D>__{i'd like to make an appointment.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{i think the doctor is free this morning. he can probably take you right away for an initial consultation.}
<A>__{the second old woman smiles gratefully.}
