<L>__{exterior cessna}
<A>__{corbett rolls out into the snow. with no time to grab his supplies, eric clambers from the wreckage. he and corbett crawl roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the plane. a moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine and the cessna explodes.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{eric tries to stand. he cries out and falls into the powdery snow, clutching at his ankle. corbett realizes eric is at a disadvantage. but before he can bolt, eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat. he lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at corbett's midsection.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{stay put!}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?}
<A>__{eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{be no different than shooting a rabid dog.}
<A>__{the men face off for a tense moment. corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the tension. letting the hammer down, eric looks back at the burning plane.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{i took the odds on getting down in one piece, and i made it. now we're in my territory.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{with light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you sound like the tourists. know it alls who read about survival in a magazine. fuck you. you won't make it off this mountain.}
<A>__{corbett drops his facade of conviviality. eric is too angry to be intimidated. he takes the scarf from around his neck and wraps his ankle with it.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(re eric's ankle)}
<D>__{i'm not gonna carry you out of here.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{that's right. you're not.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{look, take these cuffs off. we need to work together.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an approximation of their direction.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{last time i checked the flight plan, we were forty miles northeast of devil's cauldron. southwest is that way. no sense waiting for a goddamn taxi.}
<A>__{grimacing with pain, he gets up. clutching the magnum, he shoves corbett in front of him and starts walking. corbett frowns it's tough to trudge through the snow with his arms cuffed tightly behind his back. eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register on his face. they wouldn't be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet. smelling fear on eric, corbett enjoys the view. and waits.}
