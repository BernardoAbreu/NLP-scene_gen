<L>__{exterior special school afternoon}
<A>__{lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching her books and raggedy ann doll... waiting. behind her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning disabled kid leonard taunts her.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you're stupid!}
<C>__{lizzy}
<D>__{no, you are!}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{they forgot you again!}
<C>__{lizzy}
<D>__{no, they didn't!}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yes, they forgot and you're goin' to wait out here until it's dark and then the monsters are goin' come and get you!}
<C>__{lizzy}
<D>__{no they won't, because i'm walkin' home!}
<A>__{lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking. leonard calls after her:}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{come back, lizzy! you can wait with me! i got forgot too, you know!}
<A>__{lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school yard. leonard turns to go inside the school when he bumps into a passing cultist. the cultist pushes him down as he follows after lizzy.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay... i'm going to have to report this!}
<A>__{lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling she's being followed. she turns and sees a cultist standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her. lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she glances back, the figure is still standing... but closer. scared, lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as she flees down the sidewalk. as she comes to the street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front of her, the door swinging open wide. burned arms reach out to grab lizzy. she screams. the cultists grab lizzy, pulling her into the car as it roars off down the street. close on raggedy ann laying in the gutter.}
