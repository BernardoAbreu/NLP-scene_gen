<A>__{ronnie is with dennis in the food court. ronnie is smiling, but dennis isn't saying a word as usual.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, dennis. i told you i wouldn't talk.}
<A>__{ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm serious, dennis. a gentleman never kisses and tells. so, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen.}
<A>__{ronnie keeps on grinning at dennis.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, i will give you details. i had sex with brandi last night.}
<A>__{dennis and ronnie high five.}

<D>__{it was amazing. i mean, i've never experienced anything like it. i've been with a girl or two.}
<A>__{dennis stares at ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, fine, i've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better. you know how many times we did it? twice! bam! bam! bam!}
<B>__{over at the cinnabon stand}
<A>__{nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole cinnabon into her face. as it fills her cheeks, she looks over to ronnie's table and sees ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. nell swallows, stuffs another cinnabon in, then storms out of the food court. back at ronnie's table ronnie continues to talk to dennis.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{but i got to tell you, dennis. it was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, i should tell you that it's her soul that i fell for the most. she got pretty tanked, but i could just really tell that she's a good person. the kind of person that i could see myself with.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{look, i'm gonna get out of here. there's a lot of people i need to tell about this, so i will catch up with you later. oh, and i almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff.}
<A>__{ronnie leaves the table.}
