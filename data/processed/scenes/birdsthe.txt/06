<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{me!}
<C>__{annie's voice}
<D>__{who's me?}
<A>__{full shot melanie walking along the porch of the house. the walk in front of the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared for flowers. annie hayworth comes round from the back of the house as melanie reaches the corner. she is a woman of thirty two, tall, big boned, with a strong beautiful face. her hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the garden, wearing slacks and a loose fitting sweater, and earth stained gloves. but there is something about her, a feeling of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{miss hayworth?}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{the one who lives in the white house across the bay?}
<C>__{annie}

<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{they seemed sure it was either alice or lois.}
<C>__{annie}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but i couldn't convince myself to stop. this 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it's a lovely garden.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thank you. it gives me something to do with my spare time.}
<P>__{(pause)}

<D>__{you're leaving after you see cathy?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well... something like that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't mean to sound so mysterious.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{actually, it's none of my business.}
<A>__{there is a pause. melanie, by her silence, affirms that it is none of annie's business.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(putting out cigarette)}
<D>__{i'd better get on my way. thank you very much.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{they begin walking toward the car.}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{do i?}
<P>__{(she shakes her head, smiles wistfully)}
<D>__{no, i'm an open book, i'm afraid.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{or maybe a closed one.}
<P>__{(she smiles again, sees the lovebirds)}
<D>__{pretty. what are they?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{lovebirds.}
<A>__{taking this as a further indication of melanie's relationship with mitch:}
