<B>__{a habitat}
<A>__{the heartbeat continues. in the shadows, two rhesus monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. blood splatters against the plexiglas wall. we fade out again:}

<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{linda stares through the plexiglas walls into the recovery chamber. inside the chamber, sarah and carter eye the various screens monitoring sebastian's vitals. linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. she watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as sebastian sleeps. matt comes up behind her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just got the tissue sample results. cellular cohesion is stable.}
<A>__{linda exhales in relief. matt puts his hands on her shoulder. pulls her close to him.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{how bout you? you gonna be okay?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{guess so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was just thinking about the apollo missions. y'know? grissom, white and chaffee... what it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death.}

<D>__{sometimes the test pilots make history. sometimes the planes crash and people die.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{but he didn't die, did he?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what if we can't bring him back? what then?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's just a little hitch is all. he'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and i'm sure he will. it'll just take time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen, let's got out of here. we could drive up to the old observatory. we'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile.}
<A>__{she pulls away.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no. i want to be here for him.}
<A>__{linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and takes a seat by sebastian's bedside. a little hurt, matt heads down the corridor.}
