<L>__{interior bo brooks crab house night}
<A>__{we pan down one of the long tables to find beth, smacking a crab with a mallet. hard. and loud. the others at the table turn to look at her, annoyed. and that's when we see there seems to be a party and speech underway.}
<C>__{cousin}
<D>__{now, i know when my cousin paige says those vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world.}
<A>__{beth's sister, paige, smiles.}
<C>__{cousin }
<D>__{so, keep in mind, her sister beth is still on the market.}
<A>__{the cousin winks at beth. beth goes white.}
<C>__{cousin }
<D>__{sure, she's an older model, but she's still got a lot of miles left in her. but don't stay on the lot too long, bethie, or next year's models will }
<A>__{ken murphy, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{ok that's enough of the speeches. time to eat. so enjoy the crab. and the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.}
<A>__{mixed reaction from the crowd as ken puts the mic down. he starts to return to his table when he sees beth trying to make a sneaky exit. he catches up to her.}
<C>__{ken }
<D>__{bethie, your cousin jay has always been a jackass.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i know. and even he's married.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{so, you'll get married a little bit later than some people. big deal. you never did anything the way every one else did it, and that's what i've always thought was so great about you.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm your oldest daughter, and i'm the only one not married. if this was fiddler on the roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something.}
<A>__{ken laughs and puts his arm around beth.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{honey, look. when everyone else was just going to camp at the y, you borrowed my new york times, found some arts camp in the berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your own. you were nine. you never did things the way everyone else did.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{because that's you. that's why you're my favorite daughter.}
<A>__{beth's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't think you're supposed to say that.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{well, i don't give a shit. i'm retired, and i will say what i want. i will say it into the mic if you want }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{that's ok.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{it's true, though.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{they hug.}
