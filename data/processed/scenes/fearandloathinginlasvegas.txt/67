<L>__{exterior road out of vegas day}
<A>__{duke drives the red shark out of vegas. a "you are leaving las vegas" sign flashes past. bob dylan plays: "memphis blues again "aaww, mama, can this really by the end...?" a sign: los angeles 400 miles.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing intolerable vibrations in this place. get out! the weasels were closing in. i could smell the ugly brutes. flee!}
<A>__{duke drives fast.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{do me one last favor lord: just give me five more high speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert.}
<A>__{a sign flashes "you can run but you can't hide." a patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.}
<C>__{duke }
<D>__{you evil bastard! this is your work! you'd better take care of me, lord... because if you don't you're going to have me on your hands.}
<A>__{the patrol car screams after the red shark.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. this is wrong.}

<D>__{it arouses contempt in the cop heart.}
<B>__{the speedometer climbs steadily.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{make the bastard chase you. he will follow. but he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.}
<A>__{duke signals right. the red shark screams at 120 mph.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{this is to let him know you're looking for a proper place to pull off and talk.}
<A>__{an exit off ramp: max speed 25. duke hits the brakes. the cop brakes.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{it will take him a moment to realize that he is about to make 180 degree turn at speed... but you will be ready for it, braced for the g's and the fast heel toe work.}
<A>__{the patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.}
