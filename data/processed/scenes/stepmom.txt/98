<L>__{interior jackie's bedroom}
<A>__{jackie lies on her death bed. she is beautiful and near the end. despite the iv tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after all. as close as any of us will ever get.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey, gorgeous. time for the presents?}
<A>__{jackie licks her lips. pretty dry. rachel takes a cotton lemon swab from the nightstand. tenderly, cleans jackie's mouth.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now edna says you short changed your last meds. you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(clears her throat)}
<D>__{just want to be a little sharper. for a few minutes.}
<A>__{a few minutes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{some things to say. to the kids, huh?}
<A>__{smiles.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{then, bring in the presents. we'll have big fun.}
<A>__{rachel can't really bear this.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you know, there's nothing you have to say. because they know your heart. you don't have t...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{just sit me up. nice and tall. bring benjamin first.}
<A>__{staring at each other. then rachel reaches her arms around jackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full sitting position.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{scrapbook.}
<A>__{rachel brings the big book. lays it on the bed. and goes. jackie begins to turn the pages. her life with these children passing before her eyes. no tears. no smile. just full attention. fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as... the door opens. ben, hesitant, enters alone. his mother's face is fine and strong and smiling.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{find the bird cage?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(standing there)}
<D>__{rache says it's from you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, don't make him disappear before i see him.}
<A>__{ben nods. okay, i won't. she glances to the scrapbook...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, look at this.}
<A>__{and forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs onto the bed. jackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink. nothing for his memory bank but smiles. he looks at the photo... ...jackie holding a spunky newborn.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's you and me. our first photo as a couple.}
<A>__{he nods. really staring at it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did you know i was good looking right away?}
<A>__{she reaches to hold his face in her hand. stares in his eyes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{this good looking. was beyond my imagination.}
<A>__{she leans. kisses his lips lightly. how many more times will she get to do this?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(a murmur)}
<D>__{so what do you think we're gonna talk about?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(straight back)}
<D>__{you dying.}
<A>__{she nods. her smile is right there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the secret of it. that only magicians. can ever understand.}
<A>__{his eyes brighten. the sadness pushed aside.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{see, when we die. our body goes away. our body. but we ...we are not our body, are we?}
<A>__{he doesn't know. maybe he thought we were.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if a soldier loses his legs in a war. is he the same guy? sure he is.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but you can still see him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{half. of him.}
<A>__{this is so fucking hard. but her eyes stay dry.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{dying. is where the whole body goes away. so you can't see any of it. but ...}
<A>__{rests her hand tenderly. on his hair.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what do magicians know?}
<A>__{leans forward. here's the secret...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{just because you can't see it. doesn't. mean. it's gone.}
<A>__{does it? and ben smiles. he is inside the secret.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the world. thinks i'm gone. but only the magician. knows better.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so where are you?}
<A>__{she was waiting for this. for a long time. she wraps her hand around his fist. and puts their hands against his heart.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{right here. right here. inside the magician. shhhh.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{can i talk to you? when you're there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{always. always. and you won't hear a voice. but in here . you'll know. what i'm saying.}
<A>__{yes, you will.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not good enough.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no, it isn't. because it isn't everything. and we want every thing, don't we?}
<A>__{he nods. they do.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but god does let us keep the one best thing we have together. the one best thing we've always had. know what it is?}
<A>__{he doesn't. but he wants to.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i love you. and you love me.}
<A>__{comes closer. nose to nose.}
<C>__{jackie}
