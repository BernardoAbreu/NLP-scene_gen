<L>__{interior blacksmith's forge day}
<A>__{jack slips in through the door, takes a look around: no windows. the forge is dark, lit by lanterns. work in progress is scattered about: wagon wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes even a cannon with a crack in it. but every tool is in place; the workbench is tidy and neat. jack is startled by a noise: mister brown, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle. jack gives him a hard poke. another. brown snorts, turns away. satisfied, jack sheathes his sword, takes a short handled sledge from its place on the wall. moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room. slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers. the chain begins to glow. jack sweats, grimaces at the pain moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links. one shatters. jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. steam billows. jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. blisters form beneath the manacle but his hands are free. the sound of the latch on the door jack dives for cover. will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. spots the drunken mister brown in the corner.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{right where i left you.}
<A>__{something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. the sledge lying beside the anvil.}
<C>__{will }
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{not where i left you.}
<A>__{he moves casually toward the sledge. then grabs for it but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. will jumps back. jack stands there, sword leveled at will. he backs will up, toward the door. will glares at him.}
<C>__{will }
<P>__{(voice low and tight)}
<D>__{you're the one they're hunting. the pirate.}
<A>__{jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then frowns, regards will.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you look familiar ... have i ever threatened you before?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ah. then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. so if you'll excuse me ...}
<A>__{beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide. before jack can react, will has it in hand.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{do you think this is wise, boy? crossing blades with a pirate?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you threatened miss swann.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{only a little.}
<A>__{in response, will assumes an en garde position. jack appraises him, unhappy to see will knows what he's doing. jack attacks. the two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow. will has no trouble matching jack.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you know what you're doing, i will give you that ... excellent form ... but how's your footwork? if i step here }
<A>__{he takes a step around an imaginary circle. will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship to jack.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{very good! and if i step again, you step again. . .}
<P>__{(continuing to step around the circle)}
<D>__{and so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle. . .}
<A>__{they are now exactly opposite their initial positions.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{ta!}
<A>__{jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him. will registers angry surprise and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing jack. jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up the sword is in the way. jack rattles the latch. tugs on the sword a few times it is really stuck in there. jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to will, he's smiling.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{that's a good trick. except, once again, you are between me and the way out.}
<P>__{(points his sword at the back door)}
<D>__{and now you have no weapon.}
<A>__{eyes on jack, will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil. jack slumps in dismay but then leaps forward. will and jack duel. their blades flash and ring. suddenly, jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at will's head. will ducks it, comes up wide eyed. then jack's chain smashes across will's sword, disarming him. will quickly picks up another sword. jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{who makes all these?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i do. and i practice with them. at least three hours a day.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need to find yourself a girl.}
<P>__{(will sets his jaw)}
<D>__{or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one but can't get her?}
<A>__{a direct hit and will coils even more tightly with anger.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no. i practice three hours a day so that when i meet a pirate ... i can kill him.}
<A>__{he explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it and attacks jack, both blades flashing. jack parries with sword and chain. jack's chain wraps around will's sword; will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling so jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling. not good. he parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace jack compresses the bellows, blowing a shower of sparks into will's face. jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking will back. jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling. hurls a wooden mallet at will, then a second, hitting will on the wrist. will drops his sword, falls down, gets up jack's pistol is aimed directly between will's eyes. will steps back, directly in front of the back exit. glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{you cheated.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(smiles; what do you expect?)}
<D>__{pirate.}
<A>__{jack steps forward. will steps back, fully blocking the door.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{move away.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{move!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no. i can not just step aside and let you escape.}
<A>__{jack cocks the pistol. will stares back. the stand off lasts for a long moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're lucky, boy this shot's not meant for you.}
<A>__{jack uncocks the pistol. will is surprised, reassesses jack suddenly, mister brown slams his bottle against jack's skull. jack crumples to the ground. the front and back doors smash open, and sailors fill the room. norrington pushes forward, sees jack on the ground.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{excellent work, mister brown. you've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{just doing my civic duty.}
<A>__{jack groans. norrington stands over him, smiles.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{i believe you will always remember this as the day captain jack sparrow almost escaped.}
<A>__{norrington's men haul jack away. will watches them go. brown looks at his bottle broken.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{that ratter broke my bottle.}
