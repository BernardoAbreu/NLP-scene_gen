<D>__{adele, is that you?}
<A>__{a form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black hair hanging down her back. she is dressed in a nightgown like a shroud. over her head, she wears jane's bridal veil; a phantom bride. jane is paralysed with terror. the form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half; bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. the last thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly. her eyes are glittering with hatred. the figure takes the candle and bends down to jane. her intention looks deadly. jane's breath catches. she cannot breathe. the figure moves closer, then blows out the candle. darkness.}
