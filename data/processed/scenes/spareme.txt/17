<A>__{theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and buzz seems to recede into the far distance. tv screen flashback in ultra slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is smiling cockily to off screen fans and waving, the other is theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the other man in the head with his bowling ball.}
