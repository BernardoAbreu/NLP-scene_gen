<L>__{exterior seine bateau mouche dusk}
<A>__{the large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights. med. shot reggie and dyle (process) at a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b.g.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{reggie you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i keep thinking about charles and scobie and the one who's going to be next me?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{nothing's going to happen to you while i'm around i want you to believe that.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{how can i believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? i've got that right, haven't i? you don't know who did it.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{no not yet.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{are you trying to say that i might have killed charles and scobie?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{what do i have to do to satisfy you become the next victim?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{it's a start, anyway.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{i don't understand you at all one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{carson dyle didn't have a brother.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{she rises from the table and walks away. dyle hesitates a moment, then follows.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{i can explain if you'll just listen. will you listen?}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(looking at the river)}
<D>__{i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{okay. then get set for the story of my life not that it would ever make the best seller list.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{fiction or non fiction?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{why don't you shut up!}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{well!}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{are you going to listen?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{after i graduated college i was all set to go into my father business. umbrella frames that's what he made. it was a sensible business, i suppose, but i didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i suppose all this is leading somewhere?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{it led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. but that left me without any honest means of support.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{when a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? i began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need including some they'd barely miss.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{you mean, you're a thief?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{well, it isn't exactly the term i'd have chosen, but i suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{well, i can't really blame you not now.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but i do believe it that's what i don't believe. so it's goodbye alexander dyle welcome home peter joshua.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{sorry, the name's adam canfield.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{adam canfield. wonderful. do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? i don't even know who i'm talking to any more.}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(now called adam)}
<D>__{the man's the same, even if the name isn't.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no he's not the same. alexander dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. adam canfield is a crook. and with all the advantages you've got brains, charm, education, a handsome face }
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh, come on!}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{ there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. i want to know what it is.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's simple. i like what i do i enjoy doing it. there aren't many men who love their work as much as i do. look around some time.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{is there a mrs. canfield?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, but }
<C>__{adam and reggie}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{ we're divorced.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{right. now go eat your dinner.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{they walk back to the table, where a waiter is busy putting food on it, mostly on reggie's side.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(miserably)}
<D>__{i could eat a horse.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(looking at all the food)}
<D>__{i think that's what you ordered.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{don't you dare to be civil with me! all this time you were leading me on }
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how was i leading you on?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{all that marvelous rejection you knew i couldn't resist it. now it turns out you were only interested in the money.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{reggie }
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what would you like me to say that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no i guess not.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's a toss up, i can tell you that.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{don't you know i'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?}
<A>__{reggie reacts in surprise.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh, you should see your face.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(taking her hand, nicely)}
<D>__{it's lovely.}
<A>__{she looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate away.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'm not hungry isn't it glorious?}
<A>__{the lights go out.}
