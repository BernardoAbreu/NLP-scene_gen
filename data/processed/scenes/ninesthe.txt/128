<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sometimes the numbers point things out that you don't want to admit to yourself. in this case, melissa.}
<A>__{insert: comment cards.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{her overall scores were okay. but if you look at the people who scored the show highest, the one consistent dip was melissa.}

<L>__{interior restaurant day}
<A>__{susan and gavin are having lunch.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{she doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. there's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of melissa time.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{true. that's one of the challenges with a premise pilot.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{but the network still likes the show?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{of course. roger is your biggest cheerleader.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{how about above roger?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{roger calls the shots.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{after he consults with the higher powers.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{do they like the show?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{they haven't seen it. they're watching all the pilots on friday.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{why are you focusing on melissa?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{because she's the biggest concern.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{she's also the biggest star in the show.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, you're the biggest star. roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting melissa when that wasn't his instinct.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{well, hooray for roger. i don't understand what you want me to do.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{meet with someone.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{dahlia salem.}
<A>__{gavin drops his fork so that it will clatter on his plate.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{the network has a holding deal with her.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{yes. and you put her in gatin's pilot.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's dead. it's dying. but the network loves dahlia. so if she could jump over to your show...}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{replace melissa and reshoot the pilot.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{roger would pay for it.}
<A>__{gavin is nauseous. he has to take a drink to be able to speak.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{so is this even about melissa?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's about getting your show on the air. that's all that matters in the end.}
