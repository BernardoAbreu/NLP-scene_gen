<D>__{what do you mean, you can get me laid?}
<A>__{he and the waitress look to eve for an answer.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{could we talk about that a little later?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(sugary, to waitress)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the amazed waitress leaves. adam automatically lowers his head and says grace. two happenin' guys at the counter look over and chuckle at the rube. eve flips them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as adam continues to pray. the guys shut up.}
