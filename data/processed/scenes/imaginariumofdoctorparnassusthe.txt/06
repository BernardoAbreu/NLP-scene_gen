<A>__{valentina, `beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror. her costume has reverted to its original state. she examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched martin. anton looks at her. she shrugs. dr. parnassus is still in a trance, his lips moving soundlessly. anton watches doctor parnassus in awe. `beauty' sighs. she's had enough.}

<A>__{martin is lost and terrified in the dark forest.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{mum...mum!...}
<A>__{his voice echoes through the giant trees. but his cries are interrupted by another sound...a tarzan like howl. martin spins around. strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. they are all around him. they look like hands... with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. they are all howling and jabbering. from behind, a hand creature swings down and grabs martin by the collar, hoisting him high into the air. clearing the trees, martin sees he is not alone. there are many other people all in the clutches of hand creatures swinging on "vines". but, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles... dangling from enormous, luridly coloured jellyfish that float through the dark, frightening, sky. from some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle just out of reach of the struggling crowd all desperate for a drink.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{please... i will never...! never again!. honest!... from now on... i swear!.. not a drop!}
<A>__{with a smile of satisfaction, the hand creature stops jabbering and let's go of martin's collar. down he plummets. the ground rushes up. matrtin is as good as dead. but when he hits the ground, rather than going splat!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet. he can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. beautiful, ethereal music. in the distance a light is glowing. it's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. the hand creature swings down, gives martin the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. reformed and determined, martin heads for the stairs. but on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high. the stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult. letters are carved into the first stair..."the 12x12 step program...good luck". this is going to be tough. the sound of a honky tonk piano makes him turn. behind him the sky is dark. a roadside bar nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. he hesitates. he could use a drink before the long climb. he heads for the club. the door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (mr nick) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{hi there. c'mon in. looks like you could use a drink.}
<A>__{martin, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside. the door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter. the camera pulls back as the nightclub suddenly explodes in a}
