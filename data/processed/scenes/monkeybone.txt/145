<L>__{exterior food court serving table late afternoon}
<A>__{the server has just brought out a new punchbowl full of nice clean punch. he sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful when stu flies past overhead. his intestinal loop slides across the table, knocking over glasses, snagging the punchbowl at its base... ...and yanking it right off the table! bystanding guests are drenched in punch as the punch bowl flies end over end... ...and, with the sound of a gong being struck, beans a member of the surgical team from behind!! naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ice chest full of o.d. stu's organs. when the punchbowl strikes, he goes down hard, pitching the ice chest... ... at a pair of cops who are over by the pinata, loading confiscated monkeybone dolls into a shopping cart. the ice chest knocks them off their feet and sends the shopping cart rolling downhill! the cops try to get up, but they skid every which way on the spilled ice underneath. on top of which, the surgical team is all over them, playing grab ass with the cops as they try to retrieve precious organs. the head surgeon kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got beaned by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.}
