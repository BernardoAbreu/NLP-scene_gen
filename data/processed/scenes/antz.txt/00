<A>__{the camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along... ...and into the main chamber of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business. we see a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once a column of soldier ants marching along in formation a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers.}
