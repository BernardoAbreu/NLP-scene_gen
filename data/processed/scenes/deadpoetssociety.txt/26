<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the other boys crouch down around keating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{the dead poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. that's a phrase from thoreau that we'd invoke at the beginning of each meeting. you see we'd gather at the old indian cave and take turns reading from thoreau, whitman, shelley; the biggies. even some of our own verse. and in the enchantment of the moment we'd let poetry work its magic.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{you mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no mr. overstreet, it wasn't just "guys", we weren't a greek organization, we were romantics. we didn't just read poetry, we let it drip from our tongues like honey. spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to spend an evening eh? thank you mr. perry for this trip down amnesia lane. burn that, especially my picture.}
