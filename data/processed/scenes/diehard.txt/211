<C>__{powell's voice}
<D>__{how many are there?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(thinking about it)}
<D>__{figuring there's at least one to cover the lobby, a couple with the hostages...i'd say they came in with about a dozen...but they're down to nine now, including the skydiver you already met. these guys are mostly europeans, judging by their clothing labels, and they're well financed and very slick.}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{i've seen enough phoney id's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune. add all that up and i don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.}
