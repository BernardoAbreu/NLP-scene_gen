<L>__{exterior river bank continuous night}
<A>__{the three companions sprint towards the source of the ringing.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{find it before it stops ringing!}
<A>__{and bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they plunge their arms into their respective dung heaps. after a few moments of this disgusting search...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've got something. i think i've got something!}
<A>__{all turn to paul. clearing away the clinging defecation, he holds up to a beeper. and still the phone rings. returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with their arms. finally:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{i've got it! i've got it!}
<A>__{grant snatches the ringing sat phone from amanda's hands, presses a button, and puts it to his ear.}
<C>__{recorded voice }
<D>__{you too can own a time share in beautiful guadalajara. enjoy a meal in one of our four star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or just walk on the beach...}
<A>__{the kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective, heavy sigh. grant shuts off the phone. in all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned carnotaur right behind them. the giant creature roars, ready to eat them. but as it gets in close, it smells them. even a dinosaur won't eat something that is covered in shit. after a beat, the carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{can't help but be a little offended.}
