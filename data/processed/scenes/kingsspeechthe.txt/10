<A>__{umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all. the door is flung open and elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat decorated with white silk roses, now limp. a veil covers her features. she waits. coughs. no response. calls imperiously:}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{are you there?}
<A>__{from behind a door:}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{in the lav.}
<A>__{princess elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. she's further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed, and startled by the entrance of lionel logue. he's in his forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. his demeanor is friendly, but professional. the accent, although australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{"how poor are they that have not patience! what wound did ever heal but by degrees?"}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{iago...world's greatest villain. just wants to be bad. sorry, no receptionist.}
<A>__{he offers to shake hands. she doesn't take it, even though she's gloved.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(with sang froid)}
<D>__{i'd be more comfortable in your office.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's for clients. where's mister j?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he doesn't know i'm here.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's not a promising start.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{my husband's seen everyone. they were all useless. he's given up hope.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a bit premature.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{because he hasn't seen you?}
<A>__{lionel doesn't disgree.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{you're very sure of yourself.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{of course my husband wants to be cured! his position requires public speaking upon occasion. a torment. i fear the requirement may grow more frequent.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{he should change jobs.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he can't.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{indentured servitude?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{something of that nature.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history. i will make a frank appraisal.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{doctor...}
<A>__{logue tries to object but she over rides.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{...i do not have a "hubby". we never talk about our private lives. nor do we `pop'. you must come to us.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules.}
<A>__{the lady lifts her veil.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{perhaps you'll make an exception?}
<A>__{he recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet refuses to be intimidated.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i thought the appointment was for "johnson"?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{a name used during the great war, when the navy didn't wish the enemy to know his royal highness was aboard.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i'm considered the enemy?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you will be, should you continue to be un obliging.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{for my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality. that process takes place in my consultation room. no exceptions.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{in which case...}
<P>__{(re lowering her veil)}
<D>__{i should have kept my pledge. i promised my husband i'd stop seeking "the great cure." i've wasted your time. and mine.}
<A>__{she exits, closing the door firmly behind her.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bloody hell, i buggered that.}
<A>__{wack! the sound of something solid meeting leather.}
