<A>__{suddenly, we hear a pop as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands. bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. it shoots up into air. the nurses and the husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it. as the newborn sails upward towards camera, we can see a giggling smile on its face. as it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room. everyone races after it.}
