<L>__{exterior new york city street village. night.}
<A>__{dade rolls in on rollerblades. street vendors hawk computer parts and bootleg software. a bootleg music vendor catches dade's attention.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{check this out, each and every one of you. compilation tape, of my own making. i call this the "greatest zooks album". featuring artists like, well i got some hendrix on there, some joplin, mama cass, belushi... all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit!}
<A>__{the small crowd around him finally gets the joke.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{can't get this in stores, man, i made it!}
<A>__{dade wheels into cyberdelia, which just happens to be equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the benefit of skaters. the place pounds with loud, bassy techno music and coloured light. video monitors with psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. there is a video game with a huge screen. phreak is at a pay phone.}
<C>__{operator}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{please deposit five dollars for the first minute.}
<A>__{phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a button, and the box emits a series of tones.}
<C>__{operator}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{phreak}
<D>__{nonono, thank you!}
<A>__{dade checks out the scene. kate is playing the big video game. dade skates up to her. she loses her last man. she's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the top 10 list.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{that's a nice score for a girl.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(irritated by dade's presence)}
<D>__{think you can do better?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i will give it a shot.}
<A>__{kate yields the controls to dade, who begins playing. kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet above.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{is this kid bothering you, kate?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{sorry, can i get some room here?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{why don't you come up here?}
<A>__{kate obliges and joins curtis. dade continues playing. he plays brilliantly. the game is a flashy 3 d high speed chase game with lots of surprises. dade loses, but his high score is about to come up.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{he's good!}
<A>__{dade's score comes up. he's in the #1 position. phreak is amazed.}
<C>__{dade}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{well, it looks like i'm on top.}
<A>__{kate, defeated, leaves. curtis follows.}
<C>__{phreak}
<D>__{congratulations. no one's ever beat her before. you just made an enemy for life.}
<P>__{(to someone else)}
<D>__{boy meets world. let's go?}
