<L>__{int air shaft timeless}
<A>__{the light is dim at its best. long stretches of the shaft are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that moans eerily. this whole mission has been like a descent into hell, darker and more frightening with each level down. there are turn offs, "t"s and "y"s. at one point, when jill looks back, she finds rosie behind her. chris is gone. did he leave to deal with the bomb? no, but he's about to. he's at the rear of the pack, pressed against the side wall, waving others past.}

<D>__{chris, no!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i've got to try and stop this.}
<A>__{jill starts back toward chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes when... the duct work starts to ping.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{shit. one thing after another.}
<A>__{boom! the air shaft is rocked, as if punched by a giant fist. then...the whole structure begins to shimmy. what is it, an earthquake?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{sit tight. ride it out.}
<A>__{gronk! a sheet metal panel buckles! others do the same. all along the shaft, panels begin to fold inward. something outside is crushing the duct as if it were a giant tube of toothpaste. and the troopers are being squeezed inside. rivets pop! the panels begin to separate...and large, pulsing bits of flesh appear! not animal flesh. but the flesh of a plant! the things that press in through the openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the kitchen. those were its fingertips. these are its arms. strong arms that are ripping the ductwork apart. chris, rebecca, aiken and sullivan end up in one part of the shaft. the rest in another... including jill, who calls out.}

<D>__{chris!}
<A>__{the section that holds chris' group falls away... with a monstrous, crunching sound.}
