<L>__{interior white house conference room day}
<A>__{everyone is smoking. their tension has increased tenfold since we last saw them. the president, seen through the video setup, is pacing on air force one.}
<C>__{secretary of state}
<D>__{...north koreans have gone ballistic, accusing us of botching the ransom drop on purpose.}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{they're still harping on that "american plot" nonsense.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{they say the death of the premier's niece and her family would justify immediate retaliation.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{are they out of their fuckin' minds?! what kind of retaliation?}
<A>__{everyone in the room looks at one another.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{they're threatening to pull a saddam hussein: remember the scuds he lobbed at jerusalem during desert storm?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're talking about firing a missile into los angeles }
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{ a goddamn what??}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<D>__{best guess is an as 15, medium range cruise their version of our tomahawk, launched from offshore.}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{the as 15 is gyro guided. it will find the city, but it's not too accurate beyond that.}
<C>__{vice president}
<D>__{still, for their purposes it's perfect: hit somewhere in l.a., take out a city block or two...}
<C>__{secretary of state}
<D>__{to the eyes of the world it's a measured response like what reagan did to qaddafi. but actually striking at an american city would be a huge psychological victory for them.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{i don't believe i'm hearing this!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so if we know it's coming, we can knock it out of the fuckin' sky!}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{these weapons fly subsonically, below radar... we don't have the defenses in place... if we'd had the time to deploy a string of patriot anti missile batteries across the coast }
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{ you're saying we got all this lousy hardware and can't stop one goddamn missile??}
<A>__{everyone's silence answers his question.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(continuing; thru video link)}
<D>__{i want an immediate search for all ships within range.}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{we better inform the other leaders, stall on the summit }
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{there's no reason to panic yet they can't launch until after the family's confirmed dead!}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{afraid that's not the case...}
<A>__{the intelligence officer illustrates his explanation with footage and diagrams on a nearby computer screen:}
<C>__{intelligence officer}
<D>__{the north korean premier holds what we call a "brinksman switch." he's able to destroy a missile in flight, right up to the moment before it achieves its target.}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{our op says they've timed their retaliation to hit right after 5:00.}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{and if the family turns up okay, they'll just make it self destruct.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{shit! i really don't need this today!}
<C>__{vice president}
<D>__{we're forgetting one thing here: the family. intelligence is sure the north will abort their attack if mrs. han and her kids are safely returned?}
<C>__{cia chief}
<D>__{absolutely. their whole game depends on claiming a legitimate provocation.}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{still, we should let them know there'd be a response... if it comes to it.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{i'd like to turn 'em into a radioactive parking lot.}
<C>__{secretary of state}
<D>__{that's the problem: we can't. we're the last superpower. our hands are tied by politics, alliances, goddamn stacks of treaties... most we could do is give 'em a "measured response" back again, or everyone starts crying that we're the bullies.}
<C>__{secretary of defense}
<D>__{damn, i miss the cold war. russians wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a stunt like this.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(thru video link)}
<D>__{believe me, the north drops one in my fuckin' city, i'm dropping ten in theirs. get some bombers in the air. and don't tell me any more bad news!}
