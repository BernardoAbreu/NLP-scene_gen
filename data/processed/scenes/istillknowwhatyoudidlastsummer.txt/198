<D>__{we had a connection, didn't we? i can tell you one thing, though. ray didn't trust me. he was right. he's dead, but he was right.}
<A>__{they come into the orchard. they are covered in mud. julie stumbles again. goes to her knees. works the knife free and slashes up at will. she slices him across the face. he steps back, feels the blood.}

<D>__{what'd you have to do that for?}
<A>__{there is a creepy pause. will stares at his own blood. she catches her breath... then suddenly, will knocks the knife from her hand. he lifts her by the hair. enraged, he puches her in the face. she goes down.}
