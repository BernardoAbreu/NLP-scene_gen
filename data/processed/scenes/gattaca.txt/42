<A>__{german leads vincent through a maze of corridors. jerome (vo)}
<D>__{for the genetically superior, success is easier to attain but is by no means guaranteed. after all, there is no gene for fate. and when, for one reason or another, a member of the elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous. one man's loss is another man's gain.}
<A>__{he gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing dna broker, both men carrying their palm top computers.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(enthusiastically reading from data on his portable screen as he walks)}
<D>__{he has the heart of an ox. he could run through a goddamn wall if he could still run. actually, he was a big college swimming star.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i hope he's not just a body.}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{no problem. before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors }
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how do i square the accident?}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(still reading data from his palm top computer)}
<D>__{it happened in australasia. he checked in yesterday. no family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. as far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully productive member of society. you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.}
<P>__{(correcting himself)}
<D>__{excuse me,}
<A>__{your life. german has stopped walking as if they have arrived.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(looking around for a likely candidate but finding none)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{german reaches towards a paraplegic sitting in his wheelchair in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an incriminating bong nestled in his lap. german pulls the man's head up by the hair. eugene. depsite the patchy, unkempt beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking similarity to vincent. vincent holds a mirror beside the face of the lethargic eugene to compare his own reflection.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(smiling confidently}
<D>__{what did i tell you? which one's the mirror?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(still not fully convinced)}
<D>__{that's the hair color in his profile?}
<A>__{german checks an entry in his computer: "hair: blonde"}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(touching his own dark strands)}
<D>__{i'd have to bleach my hair.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(irritated, impatient)}
<D>__{why are you inventing problems? you two are a couple of goddam clones. you look so right together, i want to double my fee.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(a thought occurs, addressing the paraplegic for the first time)}
<D>__{how tall are you?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{four foot six.}
<A>__{vincent grins, realizing that eugene is referring to his seated height. there is an instant connection between the two men.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{okay, how tall did you}
<A>__{used to be?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(apathetic, still under the influence of whatever he's been smoking)}
<D>__{six one.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to german, disappointed)}
<D>__{he's too tall.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you can wear lifts.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{even with lifts i'm never that tall.}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{there's a way.}
