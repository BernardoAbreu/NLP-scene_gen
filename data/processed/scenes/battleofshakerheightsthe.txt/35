<B>__{binocular matte}
<A>__{through the twin circles lance gets into his car in front of his house.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i think he's leaving.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{let me see. don't be a farb, give them up.}
<A>__{kelly hands the glasses over. bart looks through them. then he puts them down.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{the coast is clear.}
<A>__{the boys looks at each other.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{let me prepare to deploy.}
<A>__{bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit which he puts on. kelly looks through the binoculars.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is this going to work?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{we've planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{save it for the press conference.}
<B>__{the lawn}
<A>__{the boys climb down out of the tree house. bart is dressed in an official looking yellow jumpsuit with telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard hat on. kelly carries a toolbox.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{stay low. on my signal.}
<A>__{he looks at kelly. then he holds up one finger and gestures "go." they sneak hunched over towards the fence. a little girl comes out of the house and stops when she sees them. bart and kelly look at each other. bart takes the toolbox and gestures to kelly by pointing at the girl and covering his mouth. kelly peels off towards the girl while bart continues across the lawn. the girl starts to scream. kelly swoops up and covers her mouth with his hand. he tucks her under his arm and runs towards the opposite side of the house. he puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{we're the good guys. if you scream, the bad guys are going to come and burn down your house. okay? so stay here and be quiet.}
<A>__{the girl nods. kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts to sneak away.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{my dad has a gun.}
<A>__{kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door. in front of lance's house bart turns up the driveway and rings the doorbell. lance's mother opens the door. bart confers with her briefly and steps inside. the door closes behind him. kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the neighbor come up behind him.}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{can i help you, young man?}
<A>__{kelly starts and turns.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was just inspecting your lawn.}
<A>__{kelly grabs a few blades of grass.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{have you thought about astroturf? it takes a lot less water to keep green. i mean, no water, technically.}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{i'm not interested.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh. i see. okay then.}
<A>__{kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only lance pulls up in his suv. kelly darts behind a parked car and watches lance go into the house.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{lance comes right back out. he forgot something in his car.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him and lance. bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie. he smiles at lance, now coming back up the walk.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{smile worker bee. i will be your boss some day.}
<A>__{bart nods and tips his hard hat. kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until lance's house is out of sight. then he gets in step beside bart.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{what an asshole. his mom gave me cookies, though.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{did you get it done?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{don't ask stupid questions. let's go home and listen.}
