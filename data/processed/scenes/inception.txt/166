<A>__{the sedan and cab pull into the side entrance eames jumps out pulls the shutter down behind them }
<L>__{interior warehouse continuous}
<A>__{yusuf and eames pull fischer from the cab, hustling him through a doorway. cobb jumps out of the sedan, furious.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{arthur! arthur what the }
<A>__{arthur pulls the bloody saito from the front seat.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{oh, christ. is he dying?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't know. what happened back there? where were you?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we were blocked by a freight train.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(to ariadne)}
<D>__{why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection?}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{why were we all ambushed, arthur?! those weren't regular projections they'd been trained!}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how could they be trained?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself. his subconscious is militarized. it should've shown on the research }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{so why the hell didn't it?!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{calm down.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{don't tell me to calm down you were meant to check fischer's background thoroughly. you can't make this kind of mistake we're not prepared for this kind of violence }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{cobb, we've dealt with sub security before. we just have to be more }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{this wasn't part of the plan, arthur!}
<P>__{(points at saito)}
<D>__{he's dying!}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{so we put him out of his misery.}
<A>__{eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over saito.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{he's in agony. let's wake him up }
<A>__{cobb grabs eames's arm.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(they lock eyes)}
<D>__{it won't wake him up.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{what do you mean, it won't wake him? when you die in a dream you wake up.}
<C>__{yusuf}
<D>__{not from this. we're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.}
<A>__{eames looks at yusuf, then to cobb.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{so what happens if one of us dies?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that person doesn't wake up. their mind drops into limbo.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{limbo?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{unconstructed dream space.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{what's down there?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{raw, infinite subconscious. nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before. on this team... just cobb.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how long would we be stuck there?}
<C>__{yusuf}
<D>__{you couldn't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases }
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{yusuf}
<D>__{decades it could be infinite i don't know! ask him he's the one who's been there before!}
<A>__{eames moves to cobb. looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{great. so now we're stuck in fischer's mind battling it out with his private army, and if we get hit we're stuck in limbo 'til our brains dissolve into scrambled egg?}
<A>__{cobb says nothing. saito groans more loudly.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{let's just get him upstairs.}
