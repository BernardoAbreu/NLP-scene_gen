<L>__{interior casbah day}
<A>__{the proverbial den of iniquity. hard men, hard women and hard liquor. lots of deals going down. an older guy with a walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers. he wears british wwi fighter pilot gear. meet winston havlock.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{i'm the last of the royal force still stationed here, you know? all the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand.}
<A>__{the tough customers shove him away. winston staggers over to o'connell and jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{ever since the end of the great war, there hasn't been a single challenge worthy of a man like me.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i've heard it before, winston.}
<A>__{o'connell shoves him away. winston staggers back to jonathan.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{i just wish i would've chucked it with the other laddies, gone down in a flame of glory, instead of sitting around here, rotting from boredom and booze!}
<A>__{jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods henderson and daniels sidle up to the bar next to them. burns, now tongue less, talks with a severe impediment.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{the drawer there, spectacles.}
<P>__{(tries to laugh)}
<D>__{as you see, i won't be needing them.}
<A>__{imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. he puts the bifocals on over his death mask, and grins broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{mister burns, prince imhotep thanks you for your spectacles, and for your eyes,... and for your tongue.}
<A>__{the expression on burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{but i am afraid more is needed, the prince says he must finish the job, consummate the curse which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves.}
<A>__{a look of pure fear registers on burns, face. beni quickly backs away and runs out of the room. imhotep picks up the sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing his hideous, shattered corpse skull.}
