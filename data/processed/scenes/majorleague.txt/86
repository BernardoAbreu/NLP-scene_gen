<L>__{interior rachel phelps' office day}
<A>__{donovan is present once again. rachel does not look pleased.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, my worst fears have been confirmed. we're 60 and 60, nine games out of first, and only two out of the first division. who do those guys think they are?}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{maybe you just have to accept the fact that they're not as bad as you'd hoped.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't have to accept anything. our attendance is only beginning to rise. if we can force a losing streak for a week or two, we can still turn this thing around. the fans are used to losers here. at the first sign of a slump they'll give up on this team.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what's left to do? you've taken away everything you can.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{not everything.}
