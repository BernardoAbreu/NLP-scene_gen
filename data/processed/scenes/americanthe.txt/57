<L>__{interior workshop day}
<A>__{the metal door slides open. fabio leads jack inside. at the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue alfa romeo being resprayed white. beside it, one half of a lancia is being welded to another. jack knows better than to stare. he follows fabio through to...}
<L>__{interior back office day}
<A>__{girly calendars, italian style.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm taking pictures forty minutes north of here. right up in the mountains. father benedetto said you might be able to help.}
<C>__{fabio}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{you need models. for your photographs? italian girls?}
<A>__{he winks at jack. he's being friendly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis.}
<A>__{the technical english is slightly beyond fabio's grasp. this suits jack.}
<C>__{fabio}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{want me to take a look?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not really. i just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.}
<C>__{fabio}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{you're a mechanic?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just a hobby. i tinker.}
<A>__{jack looks at the tools hanging on the walls and littering the work benches. fabio shrugs.}
<C>__{fabio}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{help yourself. [in english] my garage is your garage.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i appreciate that.}
<A>__{fabio gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the resprayed alfa romeo. jack picks out various implements, laying them on the work surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet. behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers several gear wheels with the teeth sheared off. he holds the biggest one up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bene?}
<A>__{fabio is engrossed his work.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{si! si! va bene!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{quant'e?}
<A>__{fabio grins and growls. a gearwheel with no bite is useless to him.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{niente!}
<A>__{jack wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and puts it in the sports bag with the tools. at the door, he pauses. that's when jack sees it on the notice board. a photograph of father benedetto and fabio. fabio is much younger in this photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. he's wearing an as roma football strip. again: the priest has his arm around the boy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ciao. grazie.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{ciao, americano!}
