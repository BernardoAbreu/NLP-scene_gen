<L>__{interior sam's room afternoon}
<A>__{sam is asleep on his bed in his underwear, wearing headphones. on the floor is an aerosol can of whipping cream. george picks up the can and tosses it in the trash. he focuses back on his son with his nose ring, earrings, blue eyeshadow and thin, pale white body. sam is soundly asleep. george gently removes the headphones from his son's head; drum heavy music surges from the small, padded speakers.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you need every brain cell you've got.}
<A>__{a knock on the door stirs sam more than his father's voice.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(half asleep)}
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<A>__{sam's eyes are still closed as he shifts onto his side. george opens the door; robin is weak and weepy.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i don't know what to do, anymore. take him. you take him.}
<P>__{(hostile)}
<D>__{you're such a good father.}
<A>__{george walks out of the room, around robin and down the stairs without a word. sam stirs at the sound and sits up to confront his mother.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you doing in my room?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i didn't go in your room.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i locked the door! get out! i locked the door! get out!}
