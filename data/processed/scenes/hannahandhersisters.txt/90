<A>__{"bewitched" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime new york city street. mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians. he pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks. "bewitched" continues to play as he passes tower records' neon lit window. he glances inside...and sees holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records. mickey walks through the revolving doors of tower records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of holly.}

<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{you have.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing, looking at mickey)}
<D>__{i haven't. no, the reason why i ask is i think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so }
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(chuckling, gesturing)}
<D>__{i'm not anymore. i haven't, i haven't been in television for a year.}

<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen, continuing)}
<D>__{i may, i may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that i'm running out of dollars. but...but, um, no, i haven't, i just sort of dropped out for a year...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping, nodding)}
<D>__{oh. oh.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{...which is a long, dull story and i won't get into it. but }
<A>__{mickey walks back onscreen to holly. the two of them are partially obscured by a large white jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation.}

<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i'm yes. yes, i'm fine. i'm fine. how are you?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(face offscreen, obscured by the sign)}
<D>__{oh, i'm fine.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{what...what about your script?}
<P>__{(face offscreen obscured by the sign)}
<D>__{so what's it about?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(face offscreen)}
<D>__{well, i'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause i really would value your opinion.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(face offscreen)}
<D>__{you have to remember, we we we didn't agree on one thing.}
<A>__{they emerge from behind the jazz sign, still walking, still talking.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(smiling, gesturing)}
<D>__{but you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. well, it's not my first script.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(touching her face)}
<D>__{actually, my first script was about hannah and her husband, but, uh...}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{holly}

<D>__{oh, well, god, i can imagine what you wrote.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh, no! it wasn't anything bad. but she just... you know. i don't know.}
<A>__{mickey pulls out a record and looks at it.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{so, uh...i threw it out, but i have this other one.}
<A>__{holly looks hopefully at mickey.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{well, you know, i i i...you know, if you want me to, i will read it.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping, gesturing)}

<A>__{holly laughs, embarrassed, as mickey puts the record he's been looking at back in the bin.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{you must be joking. i've been doing all my own reading since i was forty...you know.}
