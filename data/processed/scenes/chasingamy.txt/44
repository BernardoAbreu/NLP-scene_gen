<L>__{int tower records day}
<A>__{holden and hooper peruse laser discs.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{where's that bitch partner of your's been?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sulking. he's having a real problem with this alyssa thing.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i think it's more like banky's having a problem with all things not hetero right about now. and i'm just another paradigm of said aberration.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{banky does not hate gays, you know that.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{but i do think he is a bit homophobic. and this latest episode between you and ms. thing has tapped into that. in his warped perception, he lost you to the dark side which is she.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you make it sound like me and him were dating.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{don't kid yourself that boy loves you in a way that he's not ready to deal with.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's been digging up dirt on alyssa.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{and just what has mister angela lansbury uncovered about your lady fair?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{really? well then he's barking up the wrong we if he wants to split you up, isn't he? he's not going to make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay she's not}
<P>__{(holds up a disc)}
<D>__{this one?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{have it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{actually, it's kind of gotten to me.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{banky's not known for believing misinformation. he's got a pretty good bullshit detector.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{so, what if it is true? would that bother you?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sex with multiple partners?}
<A>__{hooper lets our a faux shock shriek.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{at the same time.}
<A>__{again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{thanks for being so comforting.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{so what do you care?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{well that's the thing, isn't it? i shouldn't.. but it gets to me.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{kind of gal alyssa is, you don't think she's been in the middle of an all girl group grope?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you see that doesn't bother me. but the thought of her and guys... uh!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{oh holden, i beg you please don't drop fifty stories in my opinion of you by falling prey to that latest of trendy beasts.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{lesbian chic. it's oh so acceptable to be a gay girl nowadays. people think it's cute, because they've got this fool picture in their heads about lipstick lesbians like they all resemble alyssa while most of them look more like you.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{do i detect a little inter subculture cattiness?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{gay or straight ugly's still ugly. and most of those boys are scary.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i thought fags were all supposed to be super supportive of one another.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{screw that 'all for one' shit. i gotta deal with being the minority in the minority of the minority, and nobody's supporting my ass? while the whole of society is fawning over girls on girls, here i sit a reviled gay man, and to top that off, i'm a gay black man notoriously the most swishy of the bunch.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{three strikes.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hey, hey! there's a line.}
<A>__{a young black kid approaches hooper, holding a comic book.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{are you hooper x?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(in militant mode)}
<D>__{a salaam alaikum, little brother.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{could you sign my comic?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(signing comic; nods to holden)}
<D>__{see that guy there? he's the devil, you understand? never take your eye off the man. our people took their eyes off him one time, and he had us in chains in two shakes of his snake's tail.}
<A>__{the kid offers holden an angry look. hooper gives him back his comic.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{fight the power, little 'g'.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{word is bond}
<A>__{the kid leaves, hooper slips back into his real voice.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{look at what i have to resort to for professional respect. what is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{as for this hang up with alyssa's past, maybe what's really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{holden don't even try to come off like you don't know what i'm saying. men need to believe that they're marco fucking polo when it comes to sex like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory. and it's hard not to let them believe it. i let my boys run with it for awhile feed them some of that "i've never done this before..." bullshit, and let 'em labor under the delusion that they rockin' my world, until i can't stand them anymore. then i hit 'em with the truth. it's a sick game. the world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i can accept that.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{honey, that almost sounded convincing. do yourself a favor just ask her about her past, point blank. get it out of the way, before it gets too big for both ya'll to move.}
<P>__{(spotting something oc)}
<D>__{oooh! 'myra breckinridge'!}
<A>__{hooper trots off, holden glances at the disc in his hands. pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely clad, making out. the title is 'men suck.. and so do girls all xxx action.'}
