<C>__{odets}
<D>__{i can see it. you just have to let it out. trust it. no one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle!}
<A>__{we now hear clurman's speech. the initial words below were background to the above. what we hear now is underlined:}
<C>__{clurman}
<D>__{...not only an artist, but an instrument of change. we must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy. we contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in spain, it will spread across europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.}

<D>__{the artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of struggle, clifford.}
