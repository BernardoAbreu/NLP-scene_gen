<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior council chamber, rivendell day}
<A>__{elrond addresses the council...}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{strangers from distant lands ... friends of old. you have been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor. middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction. none can escape it. you will unite...or you will fall. each race is bound to this fate...this one doom...}
<A>__{frodo sits amongst a council of free peoples of middle earth, elrond stands before them, addressing gandalf, strider, legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men.}
<C>__{elrond }
<D>__{bring forth the ring, frodo.}
<A>__{frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone plinth. he places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.}
<C>__{boromir}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{so it is true!}
<C>__{legolas}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{sauron's ring! the ring of power!}
<C>__{gimli}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{the doom of man!}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{it is a gift...a gift to the foes of mordor! why not use this ring? long has my father, the steward of gondor, held the forces of mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. give gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him!}
<C>__{strider}
<D>__{you cannot wield it. none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone...it has no other master. boromir turns and looks at strider, coolly.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{and what would a ranger know of this matter?}
<A>__{strider says nothing and boromir turns away dismissively. legolas stands...}
<C>__{legolas}
<D>__{this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn, son of arathorn. you owe him your allegiance.}
<A>__{frodo looks at strider questioningly...boromir turns sharply.}
<C>__{boromir}
<P>__{(quiet disbelief)}
<D>__{aragorn? this is isildur's heir?}
<C>__{legolas}
<D>__{and heir to the throne of gondor.}
<C>__{aragorn}
<P>__{(elvish: with subtitles)}
<D>__{havo dad, legolas...sit down, legolas..}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{gondor needs no king.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{aragorn is right...we cannot use it.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{you have only one choice..the ring must be destroyed.}
<A>__{the hum of the ring seems to grow louder in frodo's ears. gimli suddenly stands, excited.}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{then...what are we waiting for?}
<A>__{gimli suddenly rushes forward! he swings his axe down on the ring. the axe shatters with a deafening crack! gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! he slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. gandalf looks at him with concern.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli, son of gloin, by any craft that we}
<C>__{elrond }
<D>__{here possess. the ring was made in the fires of mount doom...only there can it be unmade. it must be taken deep into mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. one of you must do this.}
<A>__{stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{one does not simply walk into mordor. its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. there is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful. it is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. not with ten thousand men could you do this. it is folly.}
<C>__{legolas}
<D>__{have you heard nothing lord elrond has said? the ring must be destroyed.}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{and i suppose you think you're the one to do it?}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{and if we fail, what then? what happens when sauron takes back what is his?}
<A>__{gimli leaps to his feet!}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf! a storm of argument erupts around the room. close on: frodo...sound disappears as he watches in slow}
<A>__{motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows louder in his head.}
<C>__{gimli }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{never trust an elf!}
<A>__{close on: the ring fills the screen...streams of blood flow across the surface... flames flicker within the gold band.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{do you not understand? while we bicker among ourselves, sauron's power grows! no one will escape it. you will all be destroyed, your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!}
<A>__{close on: frodo...breathing rapidly, caught in the grip of his hideous vision. with a huge effort or will, frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{i will take it...i will take it...i will take the ring to mordor.}
<A>__{sudden silence...frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces.}
<C>__{frodo }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{though...i do not know the way. gandalf rises to his feet.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{i will help you bear this burden, frodo baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{if, by my life or death, i can protect you, i will.}
<P>__{(kneels before frodo)}
<D>__{...you have my sword. aragorn steps forward...followed by legolas and gimli.}
<C>__{legolas}
<D>__{and you have my bow.}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{and my axe.}
<A>__{boromir looks at them all then walks towards frodo.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{you carry the fate of us all, little one.}
<A>__{boromir looks towards elrond and gandalf.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{if this is indeed the will of the council, then gondor will see it done.}
<A>__{frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all middle earth stand at his side.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(unseen)}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{a sudden noise...sam pops up from behind a bush!}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{mr. frodo's not gong anywhere without me.}
<C>__{elrond}
<D>__{no, indeed...it is hardly possible to separate you...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.}
<A>__{merry and pippin jump up from behind another bush!}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{oi! we're coming too! you'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{anyway...you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission...quest...thing...}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{well, that rules you out, pip.}
<B>__{elrond surveys the group}
<C>__{elrond}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{nine companions ... so be it.}
<P>__{(announcing)}
<D>__{you shall be the "fellowship of the ring"}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{great. where are we going?}
