<L>__{exterior. the office}
<A>__{we look down on the bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown manhattan area around pine street. it is a fairly large room, large enough to hold eleven desks. but you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller offices on the floor. you get the feeling that this company occupies three or four floors of this building. despite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta of the bookkeeper the pens and pencils, the adding machine, the telephone. some of the desks have typewriters. along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. at the far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights on all day. they are on now. there are two middle aged women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight thirty. kenneth and charlie enter. ad lib hellos between them and the two middle aged women. charlie moves to the coat rack to hang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts for the coat rack. behind charlie, we see kenneth, carrying his jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle aged man is working.}

<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<A>__{walter, the middle aged man, nods his good mornings.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(poking in his desk drawer; amiably)}
<D>__{walter, what time do you come in in the mornings? you're making us all look lousy, you know that? i get the feeling sometimes, you stay here overnight.}
<A>__{walter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. two more women, gray haired and bespectacled, come into the office. there is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold in yet?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he starts his vacation today. he's getting married sunday, you know.}
<A>__{closeup of charlie looking out the window into the bright august morning. his face is just a little ruffled by a frown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. behind him, walter and kenneth.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(a nervous, anxious man)}
<D>__{well, the doctor was over last night. brought over the x rays; brought over the allergy tests. brought over a bill for sixty eight dollars. i said to him: "doctor, you're a young man, professional, highly educated, four years of college, two years of premedical training, several years of interning, of residency. if you're so smart, how can you charge me sixty eight dollars? one thing they apparently didn't teach you in medical school. you can't get blood from a stone."}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{so what's wrong with you, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's wrong? i have to go to arizona, that's what's wrong. i have asthma. when i was a kid, they called it hay fever, and you carried a bag around your neck. asafetida. now, they call it asthma, and you have to go to arizona. i said to him: "doctor, you're a professional man, four years of college, premedical school, bellevue, several diplomas. answer me a question. who's going to pay for arizona?" i said to him: "doctor," i said, "perhaps you have the illusion i am the aga khan. i have a bearing about me, perhaps, that misleads you to believe i have blood ties with the whitneys and the rockefellers. this isn't true." arizona. did you ever hear of such nonsense?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{how serious is it, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{serious. nothing serious. i have hay fever, i sneeze a couple of times. the idiot told my wife i have to go to arizona, and she wouldn't leave me alone all night. she's already packing the bags. i said: "for heaven's sakes, you listen to doctors, we'll all be dead." my son, harold, believe me, he's going to be a doctor. that's some racket, boy. sixty eight dollars.}
<A>__{closeup of charlie, still at the window, when a bell suddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. the sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise. walter, in background, who had risen and was bent over kenneth's desk, darts nervously back to his own desk.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you better get to work. hey, charlie, that was the bell. i think flaherty is here this morning. we'll all be fired today. i have a feeling.}
<A>__{he hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. several other women have come into the office by now, and there is a general movement to the desks. there is the click of a typewriter, and walter runs his fingers glibly over the adding machine on his desk. the day has started. after a moment, charlie turns from the window and comes back to his desk, sinks down onto his chair.}
