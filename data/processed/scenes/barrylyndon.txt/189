<D>__{another day, it was patrick's birthday, we were giving a grand ball and gala at hackton, and it was time for my patrick to make his appearance among us.}
<A>__{there is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes in, led by his half brother, who walks into the dancing room in his stockinged feet, leading little patrick by the hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.}
<C>__{brookside}
<P>__{(very loudly)}
<D>__{don't you think he fits my shoes very well, sir richard wargrave?}
<A>__{upon which, the company begins to look at each other and to titter, and his mother comes up to lord brookside with great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{from the manner in which i love this child, my lord, you ought to know how i would have loved his elder brother, had he proved worthy of any mother's affection.}
<A>__{brookside is stunned by his mother's words.}
<C>__{brookside}
<D>__{madam, i have borne as long as mortal could endure the ill treatment of the insolent irish upstart, whom you have taken into your bed. it is not only the lowness of his birth, and the general brutality of his manners which disgusts me, but the shameful nature of his conduct towards your ladyship, his brutal and ungentlemanlike behavior, his open infidelity, his habits of extravagance, intoxication, his shameless robberies and swindling of my property and yours. it is these insults to you which shock and annoy me more than the ruffian's infamous conduct to myself. i would have stood by your ladyship, as i promised, but you seem to have taken latterly your husband's part; and, as i cannot personally chastise this low bred ruffian, who, to our shame be it spoken, is the husband of my mother, and as i cannot bear to witness his treatment of you, and loathe his horrible society as if it were the plague, i am determined to quit my native country, at least during his detested life, or during my own.}
<A>__{bursting into tears, lady cosgrove leaves the room. roderick loses control, and rushes at brookside, knocking down lords, dukes and generals, left and right, who try to interfere. the company is scandalizes by the entire incident.}
