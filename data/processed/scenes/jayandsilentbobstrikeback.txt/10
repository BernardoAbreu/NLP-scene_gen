<A>__{holden's at a computer terminal. jay and silent bob look over his shoulder.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{the internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another.}
<P>__{(off monitor)}
<D>__{here's what we're looking for: "movie poopshoot.com"}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{"poopchute." yeaaahhh.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{this is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing. this is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would be filmmakers mouth off with their two bit, arm chair director's opinions on how they all could've made a better episode one.}
<A>__{on the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up. holden begins navigating the site.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{here. this is about the bluntman movie.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"inside sources tell me miramax is starting production this friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave bluntman and chronic."}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{friday?! shit. does it say who's playing us in the movie?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no, but if it's miramax, i'm sure it'll be ben affleck and matt damon. they put'em in a bunch of movies.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you know the guys from good will hunting.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you mean the fucking movie with mork from ork in it?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah, i'm not too big a fan either. though affleck was the bomb in phantoms.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{word, bitch. phantoms like a motherfucker.}
<A>__{holden and jay slap hands. holden points at the monitor again.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{now down here is where you can gauge the buzz. this is the shoot back area. it's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents. here's what a guy who goes by the chick magnet net handle of "wampa one" thinks about bluntman and chronic.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"bluntman and chronic and their stupid alter egos jay and silent bob only work in small doses, if at all. they don't deserve their own movie."}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{fuck him. what's the next one say?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"bluntman and chronic is the worst comic i ever read. jay and silent bob are stupid characters. a couple of stoners who spout dumb ass catchphrases like a third rate cheech and chong or bill and ted. fuck jay and silent bob. fuck them up their stupid asses."}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who the fuck said that shit?!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a guy who calls himself "magnolia fan." check out what the guy after him said: "jay and silent bob are terrible, one note jokes that only stoners laugh at. they're fucking clown shoes. if they were real, i'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. i can't believe miramax would have anything to so with this shit. i, for one, will be boycotting this movie. who's with me?"}
<P>__{(leans back)}
<D>__{and then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join spartacus here's boycott of the flick.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill all these fucks }
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{ah, let it go. number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys they talking about bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but they said jay and silent bob! they used our real names. it doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah! and all these people who read that shit think the real jay and silent bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book jay and silent bob! and maybe one night, me and lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "oooo! i want to suck youse guys dicks off. what's your names?" and i will be like, "jay and silent bob." and she'll be like, "oh i read on the internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs." and then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! well fuck that! we gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa bitches before they ruin our good names!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{first off, i don't know how good your names really are. secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. the internet's given everyone in america a voice, and everyone in american has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. as long as there's a bluntman and chronic movie, the net nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it. jay steams, thinking. then, a light dawns on him.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but wait a second if there wasn't a bluntman and chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about jay and silent bob, right?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{they're not saying anything about you now they're talking about fictional characters!}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(oblivious to holden; to bob)}
<D>__{so all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah, and kiss off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. are you fucking retarded? look, i'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since greedo shooting first. i mean, a jay and silent bob movie? who would pay to see that?}
<A>__{holden, jay and silent bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. then }
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the internet, go find banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check." as you so succinctly put it. that's what's important here.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no, holden mcneil what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do.}
<P>__{(off monitor)}
<D>__{when did it say they're making that movie?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{they start this friday.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{so if today's tuesday, that gives us }
<P>__{(counts)}
<D>__{eight days.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's more like three days.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{right. three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made! c'mon, silent bob }
<A>__{jay and bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we're going to hollywood.}
<A>__{they stride off. holden shakes his head.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{now that's what i call the blunt leading the blunt.}
