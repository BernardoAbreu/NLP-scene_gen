<A>__{the wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags. the suburb is quiet. not a creature is stirring. except... charlie. he fills a brown paper bag with sand and a candle. he lights the candle, making the bag glow like a beautiful lantern. he looks down his street, where families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria ritual.}
