<L>__{interior john's garden day}
<A>__{two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast left on the lawn. john climbs heavily back over his fence. there's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of breakfast. some glossy russian magazines, a full ashtray, nadia's knitting. the patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing. he scans the garden jumpily. the boy next door is on his trampoline, bouncing up and down, watching john at the top of each bounce.}
