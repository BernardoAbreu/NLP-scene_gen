<L>__{interior the lower "b" corridor same}
<A>__{jones and beck move down the spooky corridor toward the swamp. overhead, water moves through the desalinization conduit. jones eyes it warily.}
<B>__{swamp}
<A>__{they enter the quiet swamp. the suits hang silently like sleeping monsters. beck steps into the equipment room. jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him. their empty masks stare at him hauntingly. he reaches the end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw willie doing chin ups. he looks down and sees her headband floating in the bilgewater.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{willie...}
<A>__{suddenly willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{the sudden sight of her nearly gives jones heart failure, he stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and willie drops from the bar laughing.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{what on earth's the matter with you?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i ought to smack your face!}
<A>__{willie picks up the strain in jones' voice, her smile fades.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{dejesus...it's got him.}
<A>__{the equipment room same jones, willie and beck move quickly. beck pulls a portable laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits and attaches a portable power unit to the back. turning it on it becomes a sinister close range weapon. willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated container transporters. beck notices and then looks up at jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle pump earthquake device we saw willie use earlier.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i thought they were your friends?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{were, doss were .}
<A>__{beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from him.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{you fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down.}
<A>__{jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of the acetylene tanks. he lights the end of it and a long blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the swamp. jones grins. infirmary same doc and cobb move into the infirmary. doc goes into his office. he takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the infirmary. what he sees upsets him.}
