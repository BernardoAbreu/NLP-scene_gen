<A>__{terror in margaret's voice.}
<C>__{young nurse}
<D>__{it's okay, maggie. i will check on you later.}
<A>__{the nurse exits. locks the door. click ka thunk. the sound of doom to margaret. she stands up, looking around, trembling at what's to come. her footsteps sound oddly hollow, metallic on the floor. margaret's pov surveying the room, we see what margaret's hell looks like. it's not a room she's living in...}
<B>__{an old oven}
<A>__{with dark scorched metal walls. a bolted down bed to one side, perfectly white, like a practical joke. we can hear the low hiss of it filling with gas. the faint poof as it ignites beneath her. the first shimmering waves of heat rising up, singeing her hair. margaret runs screaming to the door, claws at the pane of glass like a madwoman. but there is no escape from the hell of her own mind. the young nurse's face appears there in the window, shocked by margaret's insane rantings.}
