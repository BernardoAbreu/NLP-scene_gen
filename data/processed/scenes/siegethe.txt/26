<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a darkened airplane}
<A>__{hub sits alone.}
<C>__{pilot }
<D>__{folks, as you can probably tell, we have begun our descent into washington's national airport.}
<A>__{the high pitched whistling sound is heard again hub reaches up to his damaged ears. as anyone who's ever flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{ you alright?}
<A>__{but we can only lip read her question. he's sweating now. over this, we hear:}
<C>__{army general }
<D>__{either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly or next week there'll be a hundred more all over the world.}
<A>__{sequence from original script. on capitol hill later that day as hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate continues within:}
<C>__{congressman marshall }
<D>__{sounds great, general, except why can't we find out who's behind it ?}
<B>__{in the rotunda library}
<A>__{a strategy session chaired by general devereaux. sleeves rolled up, silver coffee service. staff members abound.}
<C>__{fbi director}
<D>__{these sects are organized so you need a kill to your credit to get inside. it makes undercover operations impossible. what that leaves us is... we're working on it.}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{how about who's behind who's behind this?}
<C>__{cia director}
<D>__{libya. iraq. iran. possibly syria.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{ask a question. get an atlas.}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{all i know is that we must respond.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{respond, sure. but how?}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{and if we can't find out ?}
<A>__{the question hangs in the air.}
<C>__{congressman marshall}
<D>__{look it keeps escalating. first a bus, then the theatre. what's next?}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{anything but leadership.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{with all respect, senator, why don't we just stipulate that the president is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business.}
<A>__{an icebreaker. everyone laughs.}
<C>__{congressman marshall }
<D>__{what about sending in the guard?}
<C>__{attorney general }
<D>__{the national guard are trained for riot control not counter terrorism.}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{the army then. i've seen the contingency plans.}
<C>__{attorney general}
<D>__{it's settled legal doctrine, posse comitatus, that the army not be turned against our own people.}
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{even if that's what our own people are asking for, three to one?}
<C>__{speaker of the house}
<D>__{if the president is willing to declare a state of emergency }
<C>__{senator wright}
<D>__{president lincoln declared martial law in 1862. he suspended }
<C>__{attorney general}
<D>__{ which the supreme court later found un constitutional. ex parte milligan.}
<C>__{congressman marshall}
<D>__{and i've got an election in november. ex united states congressman.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{guys, guys, the president lost a lot of friends last night }
<C>__{congressman marshall}
<D>__{not to mention six points in the polls.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{ and his plane lands in two hours. we owe it to him to have a consensus.}
<C>__{speaker of the house}
<D>__{you don't fight a junkyard dog with aspca rules. what you do is take the leash off your own, bigger, meaner dog.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{...general?}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{the army is a broadsword not a scalpel. you do not want us in an american city.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{but hypothetically... how long would it take you to }
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we only go if the president invokes the war powers act.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{i understand that, general. let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given.}
<A>__{close on devereaux. as he weighs his remarks, we flashcut, almost imperceptibly to:}
<B>__{an anonymous room}
<A>__{as water is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized manner. o.s. we hear the sound of chanting. back to the situation room same time}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{...twelve hours after the president gives the word we can be on the ground. one light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. elements of the rapid deployment force combined with special forces delta. apc's, tanks, helicopters. and of course, the ubiquitous m 16a1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or seven eleven. it will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade.}
<A>__{back to the anonymous room where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. we watch in slow motion as it drifts down a shoulder. back to the situation room}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{that means civilian casualties. at a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a hummer who runs down an old lady in greenpointerior at a maximum...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{make no mistake. we will hunt the enemy. we will find the enemy. and we will kill the enemy.}
<A>__{back to the anonymous hands turning the key in an ignition. an engine rumbles to life. back to the situation room}
<C>__{devereaux}
<P>__{(looks at them)}
<D>__{and no card carrying member of the aclu is more deadset against it... than i am. which is why i urge you... no, i implore you not to consider this option.}
<A>__{a long beat. the chief of staff sighs.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{i know what the president will say.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{that's exactly why you're the only man for the job.}
<A>__{back to a van emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave. back to the situation room the army general speaks up.}
<C>__{army general}
<D>__{i remind you general devereaux does not speak for official army policy. a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti, in somalia }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ could i interrupt?}
<A>__{everyone looks over at hub. devereaux smiles.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{that's anthony hubbard, fbi. he's the asac on the ground up there. they took out the first cell less than 36 hours after bus 87. i suggest we hear what he has to say }
<A>__{he nods to hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{there is something you probably haven't thought about doing?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{and that is ?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{nothing. don't over react.}
<P>__{(off their incredulity)}
<D>__{with all respect, gentlemen, i'm just a cop. to you these people may be martyrs, but to me they're criminals. and a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks he's better than everyone else. and he's not better. he only has to be wrong once. and that's where we come in. we run down a tip from a landlord, or we pick up a latent print from a bus. our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the arab community wanting to help.}
<A>__{he measures his words carefully. unaccustomed to these kind of august circumstances.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{they love this country and they hate that these criminals are giving them a bad name. with their help and some old fashioned shoe leather, we'll nail these guys.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{ amen to that.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{thank you, agent hubbard. i, too, think we should proceed cautiously.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{now we've got an agency briefing prepared... some of you may not know sharon bridger. sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulf war. sharon...}
<A>__{close on hub as, from behind him, comes a familiar voice:}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{we all know the traditional model of a terrorist network. one cell controlling all others. cut off the head and the body will wither.}
<A>__{hub looks to the back of the room at elise, who's no longer elise. she looks blithely at hub as if nothing is amiss.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{unfortunately the old wisdom no longer applies. the new paradigm is like the myth of the hydra. each cell exists independent of the other. cut off one head and another rises up in its place.}
