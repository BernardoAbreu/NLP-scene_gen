<L>__{exterior battlefield. day.}
<A>__{topthorn appears disoriented and frightened. suddenly, he rears up and bolts from his new german handler, galloping over to joey. the horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up again as they are separated and led past a young german soldier, gunther. he zeroes in on them, the finest horses. a slightly more junior officer approaches the outraged senior officer.}
<C>__{junior german officer.}
<D>__{what do we do with the horses?}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{if they're injured, shoot them.}
<C>__{junior german officer}
<D>__{and the others, sir?}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{the others you round up and take to base camp they will pull guns.}
<C>__{third officer}
<D>__{you'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{then shoot them also.}
<A>__{gunther, the young private, now standing behind them, interjects.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{sir perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances to get the injured men off the field.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{will they take the harness?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{i'd like to try, sir.}
<A>__{the officers move away that's enough talk about horses...}
