<A>__{a grungy black corridor. the thunder of music gets louder with each step as lenny and mace walk down the corridor with purposeful strides. through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment, lenny catches glimpses of the stage. he can see faith in a blue white spotlight. she is a whirling dervish, convulsing with the divine madness of her music. beyond her, beyond the lights, in the gloom... lenny can just see tran and his entourage. dressed in tuxes, they look out of place... clearly on their way somewhere else as the evening progresses. faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final downbeat. the spotlight goes out and the set is over. on tran, clapping. watching. nearby, max arrives through the crowd, scanning for tran... spotting him. backstage... faith, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark corridor backstage. we track with her, as she walks through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the ring, soaked and breathing hard. a hand shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth, pulling her into the shadows. terrified for a split second... before she recognizes that it is lenny. he pulls her into the room and closes the door. it is tex arcana's vj control room, full of monitors and constantly changing graphic images. tex is not there.}

<D>__{tran's gotten obsesses with playback, a total wiretrip junkie. and he's such a control freak, he's been having people followed, videotaped... recording his business partners' calls. wiring up people left and right.}
