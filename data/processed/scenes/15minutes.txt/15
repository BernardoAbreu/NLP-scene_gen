<L>__{interior milos' apartment night}
<A>__{the roof is gone. the sky is exposed. it's charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck. eddie and leon are standing by what's left of the mattress, looking at milos and tamina's charred bodies. eddie grips a half smoked cuban cigar, listening to leon.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{so, it looks to me from the sixty nine position that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried. what do you think, eddie?}
<A>__{jordy enters with korfin who's carrying a paint can.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't know. we got the experts here. show them what you found i hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help.}
<A>__{korfin makes a beeline for eddie wanting to meet the celebrity.}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{nah, not at all. detective flemming bobby korfin. my uncle tony worked with you at 2 1 back when you were a rookie.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{could you put out the cigar? part of the job is picking up scents.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{eddie puts his cigar out. carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, i found check it out crack pipe. looks like they got careless.}
<A>__{leon displays the pipe emil found on the stairs. korfin shines the flashlight on leon to look at the pipe.}
<C>__{leon }
<D>__{mind not shining that light in my eyes?}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{sorry, bro.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? it gives us somethin' to do.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, we don't mind. you mind leon?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no. go ahead.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{thanks. appreciate it.}
<A>__{jordy throws a look at korfin. homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills. eddie rummages through the apartment moving into the kitchen and living room... leon watches as korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{okay, jordy it was a fast fire, we got good patterns about thirty minutes old.}
<A>__{jordy moves to one of the corpses. he pulls on a white rubber glove. inserts his finger in the corpses mouth. the glove comes out white.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{mouth's clean, too.}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{clean?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{don't blow your nose!}
<A>__{jordy's looking at leon, who was just about to blow his nose.}
<C>__{jordy }
<D>__{the smoke'll permeate your nostrils burn 'em out. let it run.}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{but you knew that, right?}
<A>__{leon looks at jordy, then lowers the handkerchief. jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed. eddie in the other room has found tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{so the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{that's what it looks like to me.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{and while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? you got to hand it to them.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(realizes he's wrong blows it off)}
<D>__{yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.}
<A>__{leon watches jordy, quietly. with a pair of tweezers, jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads. korfin supplies the paint can. jordy drops the cloth inside.}
<C>__{leon }
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{evidence. of a homicide.}
<A>__{that got eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.}
<C>__{jordy }
<D>__{you know what that is, right?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, what is it?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{why don't you explain it, bobby.}
<P>__{(to a fireman joking a wall)}
<D>__{hey camello! you mind punching a hole in the floor?}
<C>__{camello}
<D>__{no problem.}
<P>__{(to eddie and leon)}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen. you might wanna back up a little more. don't wanna get your pants wet.}
<A>__{leon and eddie move to higher ground on top of a burnt tv set. eddie hands the brushed bracelet to leon. as camello hacks at the floor with an ax, jordy continues to examine the bodies and korfin explains:}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{they have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. to the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.}
<A>__{jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what's he looking for?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{a timer.}
<A>__{jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up on the other end is a timer. korfin takes the timer from jordy and moves to eddie.}
<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{here you go. a big double homicide.}
