<L>__{interior ouishi household night}
<A>__{mother and son halt before the open door to the main wake room, where guests may show their respects to the departed. the room is laid in traditional japanese style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that serves as a carpet. two guests, their shoes off, are kneeling upon zabuton cushions. kneeling opposite the guests is kouichi, asakawas father. the two guests are bowing deeply, and kouichi bows in response.}

<C>__{kouichi}
<D>__{ok. ah, yoichi. why dont you sit here for a little while?}
<A>__{he grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests. as the guests resume their conversation with asakawas father, yoichis eyes wander to the altar at the front of the room set up to honor the deceased. it is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and small paper lanterns. at the center is a picture of the deceased, a teenage girl. a small wooden plaque reads her name: tomoko ouishi. it is the same tomoko from the first scene. yoichi continues to stare at tomokos picture. he makes a peculiar gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just between his eyes.}
