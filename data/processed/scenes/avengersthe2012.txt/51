<L>__{interior loki’s liar, underground lab day}
<A>__{selvig is working on a machine in loki’s hidden base.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{put it over there.}
<P>__{(to barton)}
<D>__{where did you find all these people?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{shield has no shortage of enemies, doctor. this the stuff you need?}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{yeah. iridium. it’s found in meteorites, it forms anti protons. it’s very hard to get hold of.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{especially if shield knows you need it.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{well, i didn’t know.}
<A>__{loki walks up.}
<P>__{(to loki)}
<D>__{hey! this is wonderful. the tesseract has shown me so much. it’s it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i know. it, ah it touches everyone differently.}
<P>__{(to barton)}
<D>__{what did it show you agent barton?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{my next target.}
<C>__{selvig}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{stick in the mud. he’s got no soul. no wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in.}
<C>__{barton}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{well, the radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between shield and that cube.}
<A>__{selvig walks back to the machine he was working on.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i see why fury chose you to guard it.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you’re going to have to contend with him sir. as long as he’s in the air, i can’t pin him down. and he’ll be putting together a team.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{are they a threat?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{to each other more than likely. but if fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{you admire fury.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{he’s got a clear line of sight.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{is that why you failed to kill him?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{it might be. i was disoriented, and i’m not at my best with a gun.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. i would test their mettle.}
<A>__{barton nods.}
<D>__{i am weary of scuttling in shadow. i mean to rule this world, not burrow in it.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that’s a risk}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{if you’re set on making yourself known. i could be useful.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{tell me what you need.}
<A>__{barton walks over to a small case, opens it, then takes out his bow. he flicks it open.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i need a distraction. and an eyeball.}
