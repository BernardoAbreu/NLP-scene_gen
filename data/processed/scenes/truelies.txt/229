<A>__{helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward the suite. she stops by a mirror and checks her look. decides she is too uptown. she pulls the neckline of her dress down so it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem. ditches the pearls. puts on some red lipstick. now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot. she practices a slinky walk, getting into the role. suddenly she remembers her wedding ring. she pulls on it. it probably hasn't been off in years. she licks her finger and twists it off. yoww! she puts it on her right hand and turns the modest diamond palm side in . . . out of site. then, reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and unlocks the door.}
