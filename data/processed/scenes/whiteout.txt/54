<L>__{interior motel 6 bathroom night (carrie's memory hit)}
<A>__{a single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror. she looks stressed. her marshal's badge dangles around her neck. wears a shoulder harness. the bathroom door behind her is open. she catches a reflection of a shadow moving across the room behind her. body tenses. as she turns }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{no answer. she withdraws a 9mm from her harness eases toward the door. gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam wham! carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam. before she can recover a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror. smash. it's brutal. shards fall into the sink, as carrie's right temple goes bloody. she drops to the floor carrie's pov a blurry figure stands over top of her. she's still got some fight in her hands lash out in a frenzy, like a cat in water.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{jack!}
<C>__{delfy o.c.}
<D>__{wo wo wo. it's okay, it's okay.}
<A>__{the figure materializes around her. it's delfy, holding her down. carrie slowly settles, then she's out again.}
