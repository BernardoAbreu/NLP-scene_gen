<A>__{ross has moved into the shelter of a wall. sleet passes almost horizontally. his flashlight is over. the color of a tangerine.}
<D>__{ross [berlin] [i'm on helena's floor .. i'm just gonna take a look at her apartment .. you ok.] fucken flashlight's kaput .. [door's locked .. shit] what's happen ing, brother? [i can hear some thing? .. something upstairs?]}
<L>__{110: interior corridor. institute. nlght.}
<A>__{berlin stares up at the coiling "i can hear footsteps .. right up above?" they disappear into the gale. doors beat at the end of the corridor. he moves towards them and pushes out onto the stairway. nothing but the wind. he's about to climb when an al arming voice shocks him rigid. "you are now on the third floor." berlin is already running. light swinging wildly as he sprints back up the corridor. fifteen yards to elevator stairs. breath less as hell he hits the radio. "fucker's in the elevator." al most jumps stairs in haste. bursts out onto the 3rd floor. ham mer back on the beretta. just in time to see the doors closing. "get ready, ross. he maybe coming down." but he isn't. he's go ing up. by the time he's recovered breath the voice is back in business. whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor.}
