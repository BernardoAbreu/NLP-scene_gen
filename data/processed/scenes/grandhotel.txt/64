<L>__{intercut for relief :}
<A>__{ kringelein's face white, drawn, tragic. one man, perhaps, remains.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{can i help, doctor?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no, the baron will stay.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{man leaves. during this scene the baron has been carefully making kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp. by the business of the baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from kringelein and puts it in his own pocket. we might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket he stands looking down at kringelein.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(drops kringelein's hand)}
<D>__{it will be over in a minute.}
<A>__{kringelein's eyes flutter. his voice sounds hoarsely:}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{over over so soon it has just begun.}
<P>__{(he closes his eyes suddenly)}
<D>__{oh, the pain.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{try and sleep, kringelein, don't be afraid.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(mutteringly)}
<D>__{i'd like to live a little longer but i'm not afraid to die i'm not...}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(touching his shoulder gently)}
<D>__{you'll be all right, kringelein.}
<P>__{(he moves from the}
<D>__{bed takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. he seizes}
<P>__{his drink)}
<C>__{kringelein's voice}
<P>__{(out of scene)}
<D>__{my pocketbook... my money in it...}
<C>__{doctor's voice}
<D>__{what do you say what?}
<A>__{we watch baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.}
<C>__{doctor's voice}
<D>__{you what oh, isn't it there?}
<C>__{kringelein's voice}
<D>__{no but no i baron, i've lost my pocketbook.}
<A>__{baron turns in this scene. he walks forward toward them. the doctor's hands are on kringelein's coat.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{there is no pocketbook here... on the floor probably.}
<P>__{(he glances down)}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(starting up suddenly)}
<D>__{more than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(looking at baron)}
<D>__{fourteen thousand marks... one can travel one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks don't you think so, baron?}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(with a shrug)}
<D>__{quite possibly.}
<A>__{at that moment, kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, i've got to find it.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{stay where you are.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{no i must find it }
<P>__{(he starts talking)}
<D>__{fourteen thousand two hundred marks.}
<P>__{(he pulls himself to the side of the bed)}
<A>__{the doctor goes to restrain him.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{i'm all right, doctor. there's no pain now only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.}
<A>__{he is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, his condition, makes the situation tragic. he actually gets under the card table. the doctor looks at the baron. the baron only watches kringelein. he follows him, fascinated.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(talking at intervals}
<D>__{as he crawls looking}
<P>__{for money)}
<D>__{you don't know, because you've never lived like a dog in a hole and saved and scrimped. my life hangs upon that money, baron. nobody gives you anything. you have to buy everything and pay cash for it. i wanted to pay for my last days with that money. every hour costs money. i've nothing nothing but that pocketbook.}
<P>__{(he crawls along the}
<D>__{floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he}
<P>__{looks)}
<D>__{i must have it back.}
<P>__{(he pauses breathless }
<D>__{like an animal along the wall looking}
<P>__{up at the men)}
<A>__{the foregoing speech is intercut with the following action in which kringelein's voice is heard throughout thus it is not a long speech: the baron watches. he throws his cigarette away he bites his lip sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a thief. when he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped him. now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him and all the time the doctor watches. the one, whole eye pierces into the baron's melting conscience. twice during the speech at a spot, through and during rehearsal, to be selected, the doctor's voice, droning but piercing, says:}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he must find his money, baron.}
<P>__{(next time)}
<D>__{mr. kringelein should find his pocketbook, baron, shouldn't he?}
<A>__{these are two interjections. and now, kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little sack of pain, his head down. the baron turns away. he bends down as though he were looking for the pocketbook. we see him take it from his pocket and turn. there is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his voice as he says:}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{here here it is. here's your pocketbook, kringelein.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(his head coming up)}
<D>__{oh yes that's it you found it you found it for me, baron.}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{goodnight, kringelein.}
<P>__{(he moves towards the door.)}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{no no please oh, don't go don't go don't leave me alone, baron.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you've nothing to fear, kringelein}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{come, get up come let me help you.}
<A>__{note: if he is a strong actor he can pick kringelein up if not, he and doctor lift kringelein to bed.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{you're all right now it's very late goodnight, kringelein.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, no, stay here, baron stay.}
<A>__{baron bites his lip. it is the first and only time in the play that we see a tear near the strong man almost breaks.}
<C>__{doctor's voice}
<D>__{goodnight, baron.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<P>__{(his hand presses on}
<D>__{kringelein's shoulder }
<P>__{he exits)}
