<A>__{half ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of the rental car. handsome rob closes the trunk.}
<D>__{half ear drive slow. we crash and we're a crater.}
<A>__{they get into the car.}
<L>__{interior rental car}
<A>__{handsome rob keys the ignition. the beam of his headlights illuminate two homeboys. two more step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's door window. that one taps a 9 mm against the glass. half ear lowers the window. the homeboy pats one hand against the faux leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches the weapon.}
<C>__{homeboy}
<D>__{what'd you put in the trunk? half ear suitcase.}
<A>__{the homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.}
<C>__{homeboy}
<D>__{just gimme the keys before i pop a cap in your head.}
<A>__{handsome rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it over to half ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted floor.}
<C>__{homeboy}
<D>__{hurry up!}
<A>__{half ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. the knife goes through his hand and lodges into the faux leather interior of the door. the homeboy suffers as half ear whacks the gun out of his other hand while handsome rob keys the ignition and guns it. the other homeboys are already popping off shots at the car with semi automatic handguns. half ear hits the deck. glass shatters.}
