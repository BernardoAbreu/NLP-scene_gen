<L>__{interior living room twilight}
<A>__{the room is in total darkness. the only thing visible is the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains drawn over it. quail and his assailant cannot be seen but they can be heard. there is the sound of a scuffle the meaty thud of a fist connecting with flesh and a painful grunt as someone's breath whooshes out. the light comes on. quail is standing with one hand on the lamp, and the other twisting kirsten's arm up behind her back. a pistol lies on the floor. quail is totally stunned. he releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same time scooping up the pistol.}

<D>__{my god! did you say i need a psychiatrist?}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i haven't seen you move that fast since i've known you.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(outraged)}

<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{i'm not your wife, quail.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{not my wife! you are out of your mind.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(indifferent;}
<D>__{nursing her}
<P>__{arm)}
<D>__{it's a false memory implant. i never saw you before six weeks ago.}
<A>__{quail is totally disoriented.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{why are you lying like this?}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{no, quail. it's true. you work for e.i.o. so do i.}
<A>__{as she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from behind it pulls out a small wallet. she flips it open to show him her e.i.o. badge. he looks down uncomprehendingly at the holographic lettering "earth intelligence organisation".}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(indicating their surroundings)}
<D>__{but why all of this?}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{we had to watchdog you...make sure the erasure took. a wife seemed like a good idea.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but i remember it! all of it!... us!}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{all implanted.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{our friends... my work... eight years.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{the job's real you've had is six weeks since you got back from mars.}
<A>__{he sits down, holds his hand to his head.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's all a fabrication, quail. everything you know.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{this is crazy! if all my memories are false, who am i? what am i? jesus... it's like i don't exist.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{you exist, all right.}
<P>__{(very cold)}
<D>__{that's the problem.}
<A>__{a pause as quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to do nexterior}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{why did you try to kill me? why does e.i.o. want me dead?}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{they don't particularly. that was my idea. this assignment was boring me to death. the personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{well, what did i do on mars that they have to keep me from telling?}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{i've no idea. i just work here.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{all right... i'm leaving. don't try and follow me }
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{i don't have to follow you. you can't get away from e.i.o. nobody does.}
<A>__{quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{no wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife type casting.}
<A>__{he leaves. kirsten smiles secretively. she goes to a drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks like a tv channel changer. there is a very small light on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as the instrument begins to make beeping sounds.}
