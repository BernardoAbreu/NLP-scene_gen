<A>__{the minivan has rear ended a black lincoln town car. the trunk has sprung open and nicky shivers can be seen in the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming. muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over his mouth. jelly and jimmy jump out of the lincoln and slam the top of the trunk just as ben gets out of the minivan to inspect the damage.}

<P>__{(heading ben off)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? are you some kind of moron?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's totally my fault.}
<A>__{ben looks at the damage. the lincoln has gotten the worst of it. the rear bumper is hanging off, and jelly is struggling to latch the trunk.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{did you see anything?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i was talking to my son. i took my eyes off the road }
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{forget that bullshit. did you see anything?}
<A>__{jelly steps in to defuse the situation, warning jimmy off with a look.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{that's all right, sir. it's our fault for being in front of you like that.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{well, i should have been watching. let me give you my insurance information }
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{it's okay. forget about it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{really? it looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up.}
<A>__{jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the trunk lid with duct tape.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{no, it was like that before.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{maybe we should call the police?}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(suddenly menacing)}
<D>__{why? fuck the police.}

<D>__{right! fuck 'em.}
<A>__{horns start honking behind them.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{at least take my card. you might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind.}
<A>__{jelly takes the card and reads it.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{you're a doctor?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ph.d. psychologist.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{a shrink. you talk to a lotta nuts, huh?}
<A>__{ben hears kicking from inside the car trunk.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{pings and knocks. cheap gas. hey, how do those minivans handle?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{jelly! let's go!}
<C>__{jelly}
