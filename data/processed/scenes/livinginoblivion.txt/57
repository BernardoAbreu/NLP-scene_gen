<D>__{what is it, chad?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{just stop me if i'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? doesn't it make sense to see damian up close and her "afar?" you start on a close up of damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two shot that you and the wolfmeister have set up here.}
