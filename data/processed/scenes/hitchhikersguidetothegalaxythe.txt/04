<L>__{exterior arthur dent's house morning}
<A>__{arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his house. he yells into his mobile phone.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what do you mean he's gone out to lunch? you just said he was still at breakfast!}
<A>__{mr. prosser, a bureaucrat, leans over him.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{come off it, mr. dent. you can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm game. we'll see who rusts first.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. you should have made your protest months ago.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the first i heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. i asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. he didn't tell me right away of course. first he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. then he told me.}
<A>__{the bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the steering wheel. prosser removes plans from his briefcase.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{look. these plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{on display? i had to go down to a cellar!}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{that's the display department.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{mr. dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{none at all.}
<C>__{ford }
<P>__{(american accent)}
<D>__{arthur!}
<A>__{arthur and prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill, pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and bags of peanuts. this is ford prefect. wiry, intense. as he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down towards arthur's house like a kid in a supermarket. he rolls right past arthur and the bulldozers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ford?}
<A>__{he leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{arthur! there you are. here drink and eat with me. we need to talk.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{er, um...now's not the best time, ford they're going to demolish my home,}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{whoa. you already know? how?}
<A>__{arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{oh. when you say "they" you mean they. got it. listen, i gotta tell you something important, and i gotta tell you now.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but what about my house?}
<A>__{ford looks to prosser who is conferring with the bulldozer driver. he pushes the cart over to him. arthur watches as ford gestures to prosser who waves his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die. the bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer and eating the peanuts. ford returns to arthur.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{c'mon. let's go to the pub. he said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can we trust him?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i'd trust him to the end of the earth.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and how far's that?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{about twelve minutes away.}
