<L>__{interior outside the codex room night}
<A>__{hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to the mouth of the doorless codex room. he pauses to hand comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at the sides.}
<B>__{the codex room}
<A>__{carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, hawk hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{"beware the odd steps."}
<A>__{hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized alarm button.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{why kit kat, aren't you a gentleman...}
<A>__{hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to where the codex is bathed in a holy light. he hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running across the top. the parallel mirrors now face out from each other. hawk sprays a blast of clairol to reveal the light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he thrusts the mirrors into the beams. the light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and hawk exhales. he balances the connected mirrors then crawls through his tent like passageway. hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of the rectangular glass case that holds the codex. the acid sizzles.}
