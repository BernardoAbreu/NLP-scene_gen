<L>__{int shopping mall supermarket that moment}
<A>__{george, wearing his `romantic' venice carnival mask is smooth talking several middle aged ladies on queue at the supermarket check out. he's carrying the theatre's ticket dispenser.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{three tickets for the price of two... that's a fantastic deal. it's a brilliant show. much better than sex.}
<A>__{much ribald laughter from the flattered ladies.}
<L>__{ext shopping mall parking lot later}
<A>__{the shoppers have gone. the last car drives out of the car park leaving it empty except for the theatre wagon. anton, valentina and percy are on their own. parnassus, on his plinth, is asleep and snoring.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{thank g god... n not a single customer!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{let's close up quick while the going's good.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{he's never not done a show before... maybe he's past it.}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{maybe it's time to retire.}
<A>__{parnassus groans in his sleep.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(looking out front)}
<D>__{oh n no!}
<A>__{anton sees george heading towards them with a mob of middle aged women in tow. bubbling with excitement, the mob arrives.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh look! how fascinating.}
<A>__{the other women agree.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<P>__{(looking at her watch)}
<D>__{when does the next show start?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{there isn't a next show.}
<A>__{evelyn and the other women are puzzled.}
<C>__{percy }
<D>__{we've done all the shows we're doing here this evening.}
<C>__{deidre}
<D>__{but we've got tickets.}
<A>__{george looks hopefully at valentina and anton who don't know what to say. we hear a crash. the camera pans around. parnassus has fallen off his perch and is now lying on the floor...snoring and mumbling. valentina and some of the women run forward.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{this man's drunk. dead drunk.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{disgraceful. valentina o s}
<P>__{(suddenly defensive of her father)}
<D>__{he's not drunk. he's got a bad cold....}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but being a true professional he tried to keep going, at considerable risk to his health.}
<A>__{valentina and george exchange a quick look. valentina thinks she's found a kindred spirit.}
<C>__{deidre}
<D>__{we want our money back.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no problem...dear ladies. no problem at all. i'm so terribly sorry. i can't apologize enough. you can have your money back or, if you like... an extra free ticket. better yet, two extra free tickets if you buy another ticket at half price. this offer is only available today.}
<A>__{the women look on the verge of taking up the offer. anton and percy exchange looks. they can't believe george's chutzpah.}
