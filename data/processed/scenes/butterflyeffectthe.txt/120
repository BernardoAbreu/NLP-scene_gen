<D>__{so it didn't feel... weird?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.}

<A>__{evan smiles to himself. and hugs her tighter.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you think we'll always be together?}
<A>__{for the first time she looks at him with concern.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{that is the plan, right? hell or high water?}
