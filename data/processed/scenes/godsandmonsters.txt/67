<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay sits sideways on the chair again. whale stands at the easel.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can i see what you did so far?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it will only make you self conscious. you'll have to remove your shirt.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sorry. not today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but we have to match the other sketch.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i just feel more comfortable keeping it on. you just said you didn't want me self conscious.}
<A>__{whale steps forward.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{perhaps if we open the shirt and pull }
<A>__{whale's hands to in. clay's flesh tightens; he shrinks back. the hands stop, palms raised.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear. i have made you nervous.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm fine. i'd just rather keep it on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? two buttons. is that so much to ask? just two little buttons.}
<A>__{whale's thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no! look. what you told me at lunch is still very weird for me. so either you sketch me like i am or i will say forget it and go do your hedges.}
<A>__{whale takes a step back. his eyes are locked on clay, fascinated by his temper.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't mean to be a prick, but that's how i feel.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i don't want to scare you off. not before i'm finished with you.}
<A>__{whale glides behind the easel. the pencils rattle in the tray.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{tell me more about yourself, mr. boone. you have a steady companion?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{not at the moment.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you know how it is. you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very well put.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the world is just one kiss ass game after another. a man has to make up his own life, alone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ah. a philosopher.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thoreau with a lawnmower.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i like that. but take care, mr. boone. freedom is a drug, much like any other. too much can be a very bad thing.}
<A>__{clay glances out the window. feigning a merely casual interest:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{is that why you and your friend split up? because you wanted to be free?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in a way, yes. i suppose so. i know it's why i stopped making pictures.}
<A>__{whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with a sour frown.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession. the horror movies were behind me. i'd done "show boat." major success. great box office. now i was to do something important. "the road back." an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany. it was to be my masterpiece.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the fucking studio butchered it. it was 1937, hitler's armies were already massing and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor. anything to avoid losing the german market. they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. the picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. for which i was blamed.}
<A>__{a shadow passes over whale's eyes. he presses two fingers against his temple.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{after that, i went out of fashion. i was no longer able to command the best projects, so i walked away. why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{do you miss it?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{it's so far in the past now. over fifteen years }
<A>__{whale stops himself. he smiles gently at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world. working with friends. entertaining people. yes, i suppose i miss it. more so now that }
<A>__{whale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of luminal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. yes. i wish i had done more work.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you've done a helluva lot more than most people.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{better work.}
<A>__{whale moves across the room to the screen door.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but i chose freedom. david was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. i didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." the dirty little secret of a nervous producer.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how long were you...?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{twenty years. too long. we were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. so i finally decided to close down the show.}
<A>__{whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows. he fixes clay with a pinched smile.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{when all fetters are loosened, a certain hedonism creeps in, don't you think? there was a period when this house was overrun with young men. some even posed for me. right where you're sitting now.}
<A>__{clay sits uncomfortably in his chair. his face flushes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. and pricks. hard, arrogant pricks }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{cut it out!}
<A>__{clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side table.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{fuck it. i can't do this anymore.}
<A>__{he looms over whale, whose breathing starts to quicken.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? do you have to rub my nose in it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i assure you, mr. boone, i meant no }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{from now on, mr. whale, i cut your grass and that's it. understand?}
<A>__{before whale can respond clay storms out, nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges. whale sits on the daybed, takes a few quick breaths. suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool. whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen door. it is now dark outside.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{come on, jimmy. watch me dive.}
<A>__{whale offers a melancholy smile.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think i will just rest for a moment.}
<A>__{the man shrugs, disappears into the shadows. we move across the room and through the door...}
