<A>__{close on a pot pouring a white, milkish drink into a cup. beth walks it over to norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{isotonic glucose supplement.}
<A>__{norman looks at the cup.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{go ahead, drink it.}
<A>__{norman places the cup down.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what's wrong, norman?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i'm feeling better.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{are you?}
<A>__{beth takes a seat. stares at him. a long beat.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's getting cold.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you think i'd really drink that?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you don't think i put something in it, do you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you put explosives around the habitat, i can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i did do that, didn't i?}
<A>__{a beat. she picks up the drink, and begins sipping it. norman watches her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{how do you feel about snakes?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{snakes? what do you mean, exactly?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{am i afraid of them? not during the day. sea snakes are diurnal. when the sun's out, they don't bite. fortunately for you, i had on my watch.}
<P>__{(off cup)}
<D>__{this is quite good.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what are they doing down here? in the bathroom? suddenly appearing.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you tell me.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{do you fear them?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{don't you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{are you manifesting them?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{if i was, then i would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't i?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what's the phrase "keeping up with the joneses"?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why did you go in the sphere, beth?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{same reason i put explosives around the habitat. for defense. for the power. to protect myself.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{against what? harry's unconscious. he's not a threat.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no, he isn't.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{he can't manifest.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no, he can't.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{then why, beth? why go in? why put out explosives? why manifest the snakes?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you think i manifested the snakes?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{someone did.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yes, someone did. but it wasn't me, norman.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was you. you manifested the snakes.}
<A>__{a long beat between them.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth you're losing it. c'mon.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{c'mon what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you're lying }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{am i lying? are you sure? are you absolutely sure i'm lying?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{then explain to me about the jellyfish. earlier. why did we see jellyfish? harry doesn't fear jellyfish. you do. they're your fear, aren't they?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{and the snakes? you want to know about the snakes? you saw one outside earlier, didn't you? when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{that's when you went in the sphere.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{one lonely, terrifying sea snake.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you manifested that, beth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{did i? or was that you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened, didn't you? terrified. like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. you did that, norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you're insane.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{am i? or am i making so much sense that you're going insane?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i never went in that sphere.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you don't remember you did. but i'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry, don't you? you remember that.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you remember before you picked him up when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that when the sphere opened?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{that's right. but you can't remember going inside, can you? no, of course not. harry couldn't either, could he? "like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's bullshit.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth, the message said harry. "my name is harry". my name isn't harry.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no, it isn't. your name is norman. but your younger brother what was his name? the one who was stung when you were younger. the one that died. the one you couldn't save. what was his name?}
<P>__{(imitating)}
<D>__{"mommy, we're going out to the ocean to go swimming." "but i don't want to go swimming, norman. i'm scared." "c'mon, harry it'll be fine, it'll be fun."}
<P>__{(resuming)}
<D>__{you heartless fuck. that's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{shut up, beth }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{when you were in that sub and that squid was attacking you are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? do you know? "i can't get beth on the radio. i'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. all alone. surrounded by all this water." was it really the squid that was attacking you, norman or was it something else one of your fears? you never really saw what it was, did you?}
<A>__{norman stares up at her, frightened. is she right?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm not scaring you, am i norman? i hope i'm not frightening you. the last thing i want to do is frighten you. you feel okay, don't you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's not me, beth. i swear. it can't be.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{"it's not me, beth. it's not me. it can't be. i'm not doing anything." just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle.}
<A>__{norman looks at her palm sees the needle in her hand. norman backs up, away.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{don't, beth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{but i have to, norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i promise }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{promise what, norman? tell me!}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you think i'd belive you? believe anything you might say now? after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past. about my problems. my problems. not yours. not his. mine.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{don't, beth. please.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's either this... or i kill you.}
<A>__{the gun in her other hand.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth }
<A>__{she comes at him, needle in hand...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's your choice. because it's not safe for you to be awake. to be walking around. to be thinking about things.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's not safe for you to be either.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you think i care? you think i care if i die?}
<P>__{(almost laughing)}
<D>__{would i put explosives around the habitat set on vibration sensors that can trigger automatically, if i cared about myself? would i? i've tried twice before, norman, why wouldn't i try a third time? i'm not thinking about myself no, norman, i'm thinking about you. your safety. protecting you from your own self.}
<A>__{she lunges at him with the needle, missing. he runs for the spiral staircase leading to the lab. norman grabs the handrail, begins climbing the stairs. beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{norman! i'm doing this for you, norman.}
<A>__{he frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{norman.}
<A>__{climbing, climbing round and round the stairs never seem to end. he looks up: the stairs expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in number. he climbs, racing, panting. beth, right behind him, laughing almost.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{come here, norman.}
<A>__{she grabs his ankle. she raises the needle. norman turns, kicks her in the face. she wails, blood spitting from her nose. climbing, climbing. the stairs increasing above. he lunges for the top step, grabs it. pulls himself up...}
