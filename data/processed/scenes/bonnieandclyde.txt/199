<L>__{interior kitchen. moss farm. twilight.}
<A>__{after dinner. there are four empty plates, but only c.w. and malcolm in the kitchen. c.w. is scraping the bottom of a wilted "eva's hand packed ice cream" carton. malcolm studies his son's quiet intensity in this direction for a moment, then moves very close, whispers when he speaks.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{boy, they expect you to go downtown with 'em tomorrow?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(out loud, licking his ice cream)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(raising his own}
<D>__{voice, infuriated by}
<P>__{his son's obtuseness)}
<D>__{bonnie and clyde!...}
<P>__{(he slaps the carton}
<D>__{out of c.w.'s hands;}
<P>__{whispering again)}
<D>__{bonnie and clyde.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{sure, i always go with them.}
<A>__{malcolm thinks hard about this.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{...better go then, you better go, better go...}
<P>__{(forcing c.w. to sit at table)}
<D>__{ but when they get back in the car to come on home, don't get in with them.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(genuinely puzzled)}
<D>__{why, daddy?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you just listen to your pa fer once! cain't you do that? i'm yore daddy, i'm your kin, not clyde.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(still confused)}
<D>__{well, what should i tell 'em? "i can't get back in the car with you?"}
<A>__{malcolm is ready to kill his son's obtuseness and his fear of clyde is whipping him into a quiet frenzy.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(squeezing c.w.'s arm)}
<D>__{no, you tell them nothin', hear?}
<P>__{(hesitates, then)}
<D>__{i made a deal and got you off with a coupla years!}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(a piercing treble)}
<D>__{made a deal with who, daddy?}
<A>__{malcolm hauls off and whacks c.w. across the top of his head with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand over c.w's mouth.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(we can see his own fear)}
<D>__{...the law. just don't get back in that car.}
<P>__{(eyeball to eyeball)}
<D>__{and whatever you do, don't let onto them, hear?}
<A>__{c.w. suddenly smiles, as if he knew something.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(expletive)}
<D>__{whew!... you think them laws are gonna catch bonnie and clyde in town?}
<A>__{c.w. returns to the ice cream carton malcolm lets him, figuring he better find out what he can.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you think, clarence?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{they ain't gonna catch 'em. don't matter whether i let on or not.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{mebbe. just you be off'n the streets of that town when they go to get in their car.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(looking directly at malcolm)}
<D>__{nobody catches clyde. clyde's got a sense, don't you know that, daddy? nobody catches clyde.}
<A>__{malcolm knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his son, fearing that maybe c.w., for all his limitations, has a sense about clyde's sense. c.w. has finished with the carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream off his fingers.}
