<A>__{a rustling sound reaches their ears. matlin readies a handgun as broom scans the walls with his flashlight. something moves, accompanied by a loud scrape. matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling statue. screeeech!!!! a red thing jumps into the air!! instinctively, matlin shoots at it. the red thing leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail of bullet hits. whitman and other soldiers join them }

<C>__{broom}
<D>__{wait }
<A>__{in deep shadow, the red thing observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. broom slowly fishes a baby ruth candy bar from his pocket. peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. the red thing shrinks back. broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. offers the candy again. this time, out of the dark comes a small face, not very different from the stone demons around it. the creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer!}
<A>__{whitman moves closer. on the wall behind him, a shadow shows the red thing climbing into broom's arms. broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. the stubby fingers snatch the candy. broom smiles.}
<C>__{broom}
<D>__{it's a boy. just a baby boy.}
