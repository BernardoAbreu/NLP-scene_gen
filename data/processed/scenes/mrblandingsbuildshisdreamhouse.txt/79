<L>__{interior henry l. simms' living room day}
<A>__{jim, muriel, simms. the room is in quiet, good taste, a flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window seats, etc. the walls are crammed with books and photographs of simms' handiwork. there are a couple of gold medal citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room. simms is a tweedy, pipe smoking, conservative new englander, a distinguished looking local architect. he puffs thoughtfully on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old hackett place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the window frame.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{of course you could fix up that old house. you can fix up any structure that's still standing. the sills and floors couldn't be worse, i grant you, and i guess you'd have to jack up that west corner at least three feet to make it level. need new chimney. new roof. complete new plumbing.}
<P>__{(sigh)}
<D>__{too bad you didn't buy it ten years ago. could have fixed it up in jig time then, and it would have made some sense.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(nervously nibbling at his nails)}
<D>__{uh huh... mm hmmm... uh huh.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{fact is, before you're through, it would be less expensive to tear the old place down and build a new one, same size.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mm. new house...}
<P>__{(as the notion sinks in, becomes attractive)}
<D>__{new house.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(to simms, with pleasant incredulity)}
<D>__{you mean... for the same money... we could build a brand new house?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{it certainly wouldn't cost any more.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{hm... new house...}
<A>__{he turns and looks thoughtfully at muriel who raises an interested eyebrow. then, to simms:}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{just... what sort of thing do you have in mind?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{well, i imagine the type of house you'd want would be something in quiet good taste, two story, frame and brick veneer construction modern, but of course fitting in with the architectural traditions of the countryside.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i what do you think, muriel?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i think it sounds fine.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{perhaps you'd like to see a basic floor plan }
<P>__{(reaches into file behind him)}
<D>__{ something like this.}
<A>__{simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, the blandings moving around, flanking him. they examine the plan with interest. what they see the plan. what they see the plan. a simple master plan of a two story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. as he talks, we see simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the various rooms}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{first floor. living room, study, dining room, kitchen, service porch, maid's room upstairs three family bedrooms with two adjoining baths.}
<B>__{three shot. the blandings praise the plan}
<A>__{three shot. the blandings praise the plan with the uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen such a plan before in their lives.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it's very nice, i'm sure, but uh well doesn't it seem just a little bit conventional?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yes, simms, if we were going to build a house we want it well, you know just a little bit different.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(he's heard all this before)}
<D>__{yes, of course.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{now, for instance }
<P>__{(takes simms' pencil)}
<B>__{the drawing board.}
<A>__{the drawing board. jim's pencil traces as he talks.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{ here in the study if we could just push out this wall a little and put in a built in bar we could }
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<D>__{excuse me, dear }
<A>__{her hand takes the pencil from his, starts to trace as she talks. jim's fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience.}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<D>__{these bedrooms. they do seem rather small. and, of course we'd have to have a little dressing room and }
<A>__{as she draws it in, jim's hand takes the pencil. muriel's fingers drum nervously.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{and closets, simms, lots of closets.}
<P>__{(traces them in)}
<D>__{if there's one thing this family needs, it's closets.}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<P>__{(as his hand reaches for the pencil)}
<D>__{if i might make a suggestion }
<A>__{but muriel's hand reaches the pencil first.}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<P>__{(as she draws them in)}
<D>__{and bathrooms, mr. simms. each bedroom must have at least one bathroom.}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<D>__{but that would be four bathrooms, mrs. blandings }
<P>__{(his hand reaches for the pencil)}
<D>__{i think i'd better point out to you }
<A>__{jim's hand reaches the pencil before simms. now simms' fingers and muriel's drum in unison.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{just a minute. do you think }
<P>__{(tracing)}
<D>__{we might manage a little playroom in the basement, nothing tremendous, you know, something like this }
<C>__{simms' voice}
<P>__{(as his hand reaches}
<D>__{for the pencil;}
<P>__{cautiously)}
<D>__{well, it's always possible, but at the moment our fundamental problem }
<A>__{but muriel's hand has the pencil.}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<P>__{(as she traces)}
<D>__{and i've always wanted a little sewing room upstairs }
<P>__{(jim's and simms'}
<D>__{fingers drum}
<P>__{impatiently)}
<D>__{you know, a little utility room where i can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or on a rainy afternoon...}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<P>__{(as his hand takes pencil)}
<D>__{pardon me, dear. on that playroom, simms, not too small. you know, plenty of room for ping pong, darts, nice big poker table...}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<P>__{(as his hand reaches for another pencil)}
<D>__{if you don't mind, i }
<A>__{but muriel has reached the pencil first. as she and jim sketch simultaneously and the scene begins to dissolve, we hear:}
<C>__{muriel's voice}
<D>__{...and off the kitchen, i'd like a little flower sink just to putter around in...}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{...and a terrace off the study, with an owning and little outdoor fireplace...}
