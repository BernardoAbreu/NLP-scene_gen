<B>__{.}
<A>__{later vroom! outside a roaring motorcycle comes to a stop. then over the sound of an idling engine come familiar if indistinct voices and laughter. miles opens his bleary eyes and listens. footsteps pound on the balcony outside, and jack lets himself in, flushed and exuberant.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fucking chick is unbelievable. un be lieve able!}

<B>__{miles}
<A>__{returns the wave and goes back inside.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you didn't invite stephanie to come with us, did you?}
<A>__{with a flush jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his bag.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, boy.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(pointing at the room phone)}
