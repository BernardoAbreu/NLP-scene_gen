<L>__{exterior jack's tower. day.}
<A>__{the mayor's hearse pulls up in front of jack's tower. the mayor climbs out, arms brimming with blueprints and plans. he struts to jack's door his self confident face on and bangs the knocker.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{jack?!}
<A>__{he waits for an answer. there isn't any. even this little bit of suspense brings out the mayor's other face this one is scared, self doubting.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{jack?! you home?!}
<A>__{there's still no answer. the mayor squints out into the street. clearing his throat, he barks confidently at passers by:}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(to various passers by)}
<D>__{have you seen jack?... have you seen jack?...}
<A>__{but nobody has. he doesn't bother to ask the street band set up across the street. the mayor's bravado face evaporates and the whiny one takes over.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{where is he? we had an appointment.}
<A>__{his blustery face back on, the mayor shouts up to jack's room at the top of the tower.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{jack?! i've got the plans for next year! see?!}
<A>__{he holds up the blueprints and plans he carries.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{i need to go over them with you so we can get started! halloween'll be here again in no time! three hundred and sixty odd days fly by too fast!}
<A>__{the mayor's faces alternate in progressively rapid succession as panic sets in.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(shouts desperately)}
<D>__{jack! please! i'm only an elected official here! i can't make decisions! jack! answer me!}
<A>__{ruined, the mayor crumples. the accordion player of the street band says quietly from across the street:}
<C>__{accordion player}
<D>__{he can't.}
<A>__{the mayor looks up.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{accordion player}
<D>__{he's not home.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{accordion player}
<D>__{he hasn't been home all night.}
<A>__{the mayor tries to rouse himself, but he's shorted out, exhausted...}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(feebly)}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{he drops again to the sidewalk.}
