<A>__{gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with jake and miles.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{seems lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night.}
<A>__{they just pulled him out of the east river.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{well, this is just fucking great...}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{it gets worse. now i know why he was such a good rope. x mean, cash.... that much and we never had to put him on the "send?" turns out this ducking moe was an accountant for the king pin.}
<A>__{gordo throws jake a hard look, letting the news sink in. jake can only slump back into the booth.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday. `cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king's money back before any body says "boo."}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what's a king pin?}
<A>__{gordo looks to jake, but can see that he's still processing the information.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{currently, the king pin is a very large type pole stuck up our asses.}
<C>__{mtles}
<D>__{mob?}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{independant. same shit, just independant. they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... big. fat. bald.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so what? we hide, right?}
<C>__{gordo}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{what are you? new? let me tell you how good this guy is. last night, al calls this bookie to settle up. apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. so the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? what does al do?}
<C>__{gordo }
<D>__{does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond? does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? no... he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole type... how he fleeced.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're pissed we didn't get credit?}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{no, that was the only semi fucking smart thing he said! except anybody that's ever met big a1 knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. this guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the king and }
