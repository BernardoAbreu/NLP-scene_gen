<A>__{here is a part of the castle kafka can understand office workers toiling away. kafka walks past one long row of them, scribes sitting at a single endless desk. they look like students under examination, hunched over their writing, a virtual conveyor belt of paperwork. in the center of this floor is an actual conveyor a chain pulley running slowly up and down, presumably throughout the entire castle, through small holes in the floor and ceiling. there are little pockets on the chain which the clerks continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into. the ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry. he takes it over to a sink with three taps hot, cold and the third one he turns ink .}
