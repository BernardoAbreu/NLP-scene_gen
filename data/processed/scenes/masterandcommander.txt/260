<L>__{254. gun deck dawn}
<A>__{men are checking the breechings of the great guns and chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical, more deadly. the armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes at their feet. another team check and load pistols by the score.}
<L>__{254. midshipmen's quarters dawn}
<A>__{alone, blakeney awkwardly draws his dirk, left handed from its scabbard. it glints momentarily in the lamp light. calamy enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy when he sees blakeney.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{it's all right. permission to boast. you're to lead the boarders from the forecastle. congratulations.}
<C>__{calamy}

<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{you'll make lieutenant out of this.}
<A>__{the others come in.}
<C>__{boyle}
<D>__{he already has. 'acting' 3rd lieutenant peter calamy.}
<A>__{oohs and aahs from all.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{then i will see you at the forecastle, 'lieutenant'.}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{that's not your station.}
<A>__{blakeney looks from calamy to the others, who avoid his eye.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{but naturally i will board with you?}
<C>__{calamy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, will. captain's orders.}
<A>__{blakeney is devastated. rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement.}
