<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{the room is lit by one bedside lamp. maurice is sitting in bed wearing a robe. reading glasses at the end of his nose as he rubs a yellow cloth over a silver medallion. the medallion has a raised picture of a lamp, the kind aladdin uses, seated on an open book and the words book society }
<L>__{1992. maurice meticulously rubs away the smudge marks.}
<A>__{ellen is at the edge of the bed as far from maurice as possible. her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers. she speaks without turning around.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{why do you polish that thing all the time?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you're talking to me?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{why do you polish it?}
<A>__{maurice studies the impressive silver medallion.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{a book society award is a very prestigious thing.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at 11:15 at night? are you going to show it to someone?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{then why?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{there's no reason.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{exactly. no reason. no occasion. it just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?}
<A>__{maurice has no answer. he just stares at his hands. ellen's face can be seen under the covers facing away from maurice. her eyes are red. the tears roll off her nose and land on the pillow unseen and unheard.}
