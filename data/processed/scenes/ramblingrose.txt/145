<A>__{other and daddy at the kitchen table.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{i wish you wouldn't pick on rose and tease her like that. of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{the girl worries me. if she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, i admit that outfit isn't very modest. but she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{she will succeed.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i don't think you understand her. it isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(musingly)}
<D>__{that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and i'm beginning to see why.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, she loves children, all right.}
<P>__{(adds dryly)}
<D>__{she loves everybody.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{but that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{have a little patience with her. she's such a good hearted little thing and tries so hard.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(stares pensively at her)}
<D>__{you are the one who's good hearted.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{as for rose, let's hope for the best.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(rises, again takes his hand)}
<D>__{be kind to her. she loves you so much.}
<P>__{(daddy stiffens slightly, and she adds)}
<D>__{in a perfectly proper way, of course.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{yes, of course.}
