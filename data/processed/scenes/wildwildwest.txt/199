<A>__{west slowly gets up. loveless is about to roll over him. he jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels. a smile comes to west's face as he watches loveless's frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{when you get right down to it, loveless, you just can't beat a good pair of legs.}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(thin smile)}
<D>__{you're obviously not a poker player, mr. west...}
<A>__{loveless presses a button, the sound of mechanical gears engaging. suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{two pair always beats a pair.}
<A>__{west stares up at him slack jawed. loveless rolls up his sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{now... was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action?}

<A>__{loveless imitates west by kicking with a lightning flash of an alloy leg. it's a rib cracker that sends west sprawling.}

<D>__{a mother, perhaps? a father?}
<A>__{close west's hand he's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch. as west screams in pain...}
