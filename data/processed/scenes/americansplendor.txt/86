<L>__{interior harvey's living room spring 1980's night}
<A>__{the room is moody, dark and lonely. the shadowy figure of harvey sits on the floor devouring jennie gerhardt.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{sure lester the main character croaks in the end, but at least he's old and dies a natural dignified death.}
<A>__{the camera travels around the room to find: harvey again, now silhouetted in the door frame, still clutching the book and obsessed by his thoughts.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{i was more alone that weekend than any. all i did was think about jennie gerhardt an' alice quinn an' all the decades of people i have known.}
<A>__{the camera travels again to find harvey sitting on a chair in the corner of his room. his head is bowed. his shoulders slump over, as if he's struggling with something weighty.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{the more i thought, the more i felt like cryin'; life seemed so sweet an' so sad an' so hard t'let go of in the end.}
<A>__{the camera travels a final time to find: harvey sprawled across his couch. but he's not asleep; he's still obsessing. the book lies on his chest like a lover. close up of harvey's troubled face. beneath the pain, we see hope and determination.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{but hey, man. every day's a brand new deal, right? just keep on workin' and sump'n's bound ta turn up.}
