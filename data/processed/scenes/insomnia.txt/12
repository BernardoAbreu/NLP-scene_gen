<L>__{interior will's room night}
<A>__{will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking. the room is sparse and creaky. bed dips in the middle. he hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase. pulls out his smith and wesson 45. lays it on the bedside table. takes out a shoulder holster. a back holster. a handful of shells. lays them on the table. then a small smith and wesson 39 13 9mm. checks the magazine. there's a knock on the adjoining door.}
<C>__{hap }
<D>__{me.}
<A>__{will slaps the magazine back.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{hap opens the door. a glimpse into his room: family pictures on his bedside table a woman and three teenage girls.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{see you have the same decor as my room.}
<A>__{he walks over to the big window. it overlooks the harbor. big, snow capped mountains in the distance. one lone tugboat in the harbor towing a freighter.}
<C>__{hap }
<D>__{same view, too.}
<P>__{(looks out)}
<D>__{i've been watching that tugboat for the last half hour. so small, pulling all that weight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have to talk, will.}
<A>__{will reaches into his suitcase. pulls out a shirt.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what do you want to talk about?}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{you know what about.}
<A>__{will throws him a look.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we'll talk when we get back to seattle.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{when's that, a week? two weeks?...}
<P>__{(heads over to him)}
<D>__{we have to figure out a plan of action now.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you know my plan of action.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{to do nothing.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{dammit, will. warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. five hours. asking all kinds of questions...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{he's asking everybody questions.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{but he's zeroing in on me. on us. everyone's talking about it.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{he's just rattling your cage.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{well, i gotta tell you. with a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we say nothing. it goes away. simple as that.}
<A>__{will goes back to his suitcase. hap follows. a thin film of sweat on his upper lip.}
<C>__{hap}
<P>__{(lowers voice)}
<D>__{look. we've tampered with evidence. we've pushed witnesses. we've planted shit. and they're sniffing around like dogs. especially on the dobbs case...}
<A>__{will flares up. struck a nerve. turns to his partner.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{weston dobbs killed an eight year old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. you remember that?}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{you know i remember that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{one word to i.a. and he walks.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{maybe not. we could talk to buck...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{cut some kind of a deal. i heard that's what flynn's doing...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{mike flynn's a dirty cop, hap! we are nothing like mike flynn. we did what we needed to do to make sure that son of bitch dobbs paid for what he did. and every bastard like him. we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. every last one. and i am not going to let that happen. no deals. no compromises. no discussions.}
<A>__{he grabs a hanger.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{goddammit, will. you grab on to something and you don't let it go.}
<A>__{he takes out a handkerchief. wipes his brow.}
<C>__{hap}
<D>__{i don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else. i can't tell any more.}
<P>__{(steps back)}
<D>__{but i can tell you one thing. i'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff. breaking the rules. cleaning up messes. we're a dying breed, will. you're a dying breed. i.a., the d.a., all those reporters they don't care what you did at leland street seven years ago. they don't care that you've made this your life. they don't care about getting the bad guy...}
<A>__{will turns on his partner, eyes burning.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i care.}
<A>__{the partners, lock eyes. years of working together. a thousand things unsaid. hap reaches for the door.}
<C>__{hap }
<D>__{they're watching us, will. like it or not. they're watching us.}
