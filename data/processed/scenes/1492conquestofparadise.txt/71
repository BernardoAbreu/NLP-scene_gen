<A>__{three row boats plunging through the surf towards the beach. columbus stands in the prow of the first boat. mendez is in the second. pinzon the third. they stare entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue clarity of the water... as the first boat beaches, columbus leaps out and wades ashore. behind him the rest of the landing party splash through the sun dazzled water, carrying the banner of castille and aragon.}
