<L>__{interior elaine's mansion day}
<A>__{viktor waits in an opulent drawing room. despite the eighty degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. elaine enters, waving a thick studio file. viktor's face falls, expecting a less business related conversation.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{viktor, we simply have to talk about "eternity..."}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{"forever".}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{whatever. i still haven't received simone's script notes.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{there aren't any. if the filmmakers are happy, simone's happy. she considers herself an... "instrument".}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{really? oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{if it's on the page...}
<A>__{elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{well, something has to be done about this budget. it's completely unrealistic.}
<P>__{(referring to a column in the budget)}
<D>__{you allowed nothing for limousine service.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she'll drive herself.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{hair and make up?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she'll do her own. theater training.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she was in the theater? when? where?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i will send you her resume.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{al least a contingency for wardrobe. any woman can go up a dress size.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ i guarantee she won't gain an once. she's very disciplined.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(concerned by an entry in the budget)}
<D>__{well, we have to do something about this "stuntwoman".}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{there isn't one.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no need. she does all her own stunts.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{even the fall from the plane?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(nonchalant)}
<D>__{even the fall from the plane.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{well, shoot it on the last day.}
<A>__{viktor regards elaine with a condescending look.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{as i've tried to explain to you, elaine. simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. she's about the work and only the work lives for the work. she wants all the money up there...}
<P>__{(gazing into space)}
<D>__{... on the screen where it belongs. she'd work for scale except i know you only respect people you pay a fortune.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{which accounts for your percentage.}
<P>__{(tossing the budget on the coffee table)}
<D>__{when do i get to meet this dream?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{not today. she's learning her lines.}
<P>__{(glancing to elaine's budget)}
<D>__{you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i will walk you out.}
<A>__{elaine escorts viktor out to the lavish garden.}
