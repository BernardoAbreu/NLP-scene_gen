<A>__{jim, mind totally gone into his trance, spreading his arms like wings, hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman around his microphone, whirling, yelling out great rewards for the tribe. plentiful antelope, healthy corn. the kids are going wild writhing like maenads in his intoxicating embrace. embers from an enormous bonfire drift past the stadium lights into the night. but the kids, increasingly frustrated by a barrage of cops, cannot see their leader and now push against the cops with the very result the authorities seek to repress.}
<D>__{jim & doors who lives in a well by the side of the road wake up girl! we're almost home we shall see the gates by morning we shall be inside by evening sun, sun, sun burn, burn, burn moon, moon, moon!}
<A>__{ray, gone into his own trance, happening to look up from his keyboard. his eyes widen. his pov an indian shaman hovers over the microphone. cloaked in hides, his face obscured by a horned headdress with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders, rattles in each fist, the bonfire glowing...}
<D>__{jim & doors i will get you soon soooooooon... sooooooonnnn...}
<A>__{the cops can't hold. teenage shock troops hitting the stage, clambering up. the stage becoming a riot. cops wading in with sticks. roadies and bodyguards yanking the musicians from their places...}

<D>__{i am the lizard king i can do anything}
<A>__{as dog hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug, smiling stoned, immaculate.}
