<L>__{interior dwight's living room night}
<A>__{norma plays "blue monday" on an upright piano whilst toby sings it. after finishing the song, norma launches into "on moonlight bay." everybody joins in. toby and caroline glance at each other and smile. same scene middle of night caroline, who is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from the bathroom. she sees that toby's awake on his pallet on the floor. she sits on the floor beside him. (the whole conversation is conducted in whispers.)}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{so what do you think?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{they're okay. what's that bald spot on pearl's head? ugh.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{some sort of infection.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{norma's nice.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{they're all nice, but dwight keeps rushing me, keeps talking about marriage. and i don't really want to get married not now anyway.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that's fine with me.}
<P>__{(a beat; new tone)}
<D>__{i wish you would've stayed married to dad.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, don't wish duke back on me. god.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that woman he married? is she really rich?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{like king midas. okay, look, we'll go back to seattle and see how things go. i've been thinking about taking a course in stenotyping. a court reporter's pay is real high. kathy got engaged, so either i find us another roommate or i've got to make some more money. and this stenotyping thing sounds just right. this could turn out good, honey.}
