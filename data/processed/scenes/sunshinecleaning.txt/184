<A>__{with windows down, norah drives across an open landscape. she glances at a wind battered map. a highlighted route cuts across the country. destination california. norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. she holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind.}

<A>__{oscar, in a catholic school uniform, holds binoculars to his face. he watches a scrawny girl across the school yard. the girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the invisible strand over a pencil. she glances over to oscar. oscar doesn't flinch. with school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls. it is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting. oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal the lil' bastard tattoo. the girl smiles. oscar smiles.}
