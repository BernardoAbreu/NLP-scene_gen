<A>__{carl walks around a photography gallery. renee's photos are up. they are terrible photos, since they were taken while she was jogging. their subjects are blurry. some of them are half in the photo and half out. the featured photo is of carl throwing up on the ground.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you really are displaying that.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{that's probably my best photo ever. my collages aren't bad. but personally, i think i excel at pottery.}
<A>__{renee points to a large, brown plate that looks like poo.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{wow. that's really big. how do you have time for all this stuff?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{how do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in fairfield county that was seventy five miles from here? i almost skipped that one.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you gave me the flier, so i had to go.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{at first i thought you were a weird stalker and i was scared. but now i think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. and while it's been suspenseful to see when if you'd ask me out }
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{do you want to go out sometime?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{yes, i would.}
<C>__{carl}
