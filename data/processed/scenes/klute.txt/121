<T>__{we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior the plaza of lincoln center}
<A>__{sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and elegant architecture. groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to man's search for culture. camera pans to ugly street across the way revealing klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the statue of liberty. this is the municipal storehouse.}
<L>__{interior municipal storehouse day}
<A>__{the abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow klute. we are in a huge storeroom. as we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along klute's path old pieces of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. the remnants of the lives of the plundered, the destroyed and the dispossessed. some is stolen property, some evidence for homicide cases, and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead. a custodian an ancient retainer sort, a civil servant, leads klute into an old elevator cage.}
