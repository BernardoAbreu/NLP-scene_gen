<L>__{exterior rubber plantation trees by terrace night}
<A>__{guests are still coming in from the cars, strolling down through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering like birds. laughter comes from the terrace. glass tinkles and the tiny lanterns bob and sway. nick appears, hurrying down the steps. suddenly he stops. merle is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. he is alone, dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving guests with an expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops, or snow flakes, or falling stones.}

<D>__{merle!}
<A>__{merle turns, watching nick as he crosses toward him. when nick reaches the table, he stands.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merle... hey, merle, listen...}
<P>__{(stares at him)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{for a moment merle doesn't answer. his eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through nick, as if to some landscape far beyond.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i like it because it's simple.}
<A>__{a beautiful vietnamese girl steps up and whispers something in merle's ear.}
<C>__{merle }
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{i have to go, nick. we'll have a drink.}
<A>__{merle and the vietnamese girl move into the crowd.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merle...! merle, wait!}
<A>__{nick starts after them. he can see them ahead, moving rapidly through a group of arvn officers and whores.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{merle!!!}
<A>__{nick sees he can never overtake them directly. he cuts around to the terrace.}
