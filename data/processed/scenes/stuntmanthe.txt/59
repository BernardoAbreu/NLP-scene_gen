<L>__{54 cameron's pov police car}
<A>__{a police car has driven onto the beach. from it, three officers have emerged. they are armed and efficient looking. the production manager moves to greet them. eli takes cameron's wrist and gently pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). jake, the chief, is irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.}

<D>__{all right, this time you've had it! where is he?!}
<C>__{production manager}
<D>__{chief, i'm glad you dropped by. eli says you gotta do something about all these people on the beach.}
