<A>__{a small dance studio... a scratchy phonograph record playing music... young girls learning how to dance...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{she opened a dance studio...}
<A>__{and we see daisy, in a long skirt over a long sleeved leotard... wearing slippers... the first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a year... happily teaching young girls how to dance...}
<L>__{interior dance studio, new orleans night, 1967}
<A>__{we see daisy alone... cleaning up... music playing on the record player... and for a brief moment she stops, and dances... the smallest, most tentative of steps... she sees in the studio's mirrors benjamin's been silently watching her...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{you're still beautiful to watch...}
<A>__{she looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what happens...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{dancing is all about the line... the line of your body...after awhile... you lose the line... and you can never get it back...}
<A>__{they look at each other in the mirror...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i figured out if you were born in 1918... 49 years ago... i'm 43... we're almost the same age... in three years we'll meet in the middle...}
<A>__{and what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's going one way and he's going the other...benjamin affectionately...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{we finally caught up to each other...}
<A>__{she smiles, starts to turn...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{stay just like that... i want to remember what we look like right now.}
<A>__{they stay like that for a moment longer... she turns to get her things... she shuts off the lights... she takes his arm...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i thought i was far too old... i'm pregnant...}
<A>__{he stops... they look at each other, she smiles, nodding "yes," it's true. and deeply moved he takes her in his arms... grateful...touching her face... holding her...}
