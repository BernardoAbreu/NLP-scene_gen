<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<A>__{dr. dreyfus looks over sissy's thumbs.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfus}
<D>__{she is, if i may speak frankly, somewhat of a medical oddity. due to impaired dexterity, her life activities and career potentialities will be reduced. it could be worse. bring her back to me if there ever is pain. meanwhile, she will have to learn to live with them.}
<C>__{mrs. hankshaw}
<D>__{that she will. that she will. the lord made them things big for a purpose. god don't never git tired of testing our kind. it's a punishment of some sort, for what i don't rightly know.}
<P>__{(whimpering)}
<D>__{oh doc, if a young man ever shows up here with, a young man with ugly fingers, you know, something similar, a similar case, doc, would you please...}
<C>__{dr. dreyfus}
<D>__{remember the words of the painter paul gauguin, dear lady. "the ugly may be beautiful, the pretty never." i don't suppose that means very much to you.}
<C>__{mrs. hankshaw}
<D>__{it's a judgement. she's gotta bear the punishment.}
<A>__{sissy beams serenely like a christ figure.}
