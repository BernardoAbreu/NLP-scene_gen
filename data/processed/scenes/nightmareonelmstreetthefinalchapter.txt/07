<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town. he rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him. most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom. suddenly a cackling sound is heard and jacob turns to its source: his pov: the springwood sign the town can still be seen behind it the darkness over almost all of it now. the sign reads: welcome to springwood.}
<B>__{population...}
<A>__{and the numbers after the word "population" are changing. they're counting backwards, clattering away like an old time gas pump in reverse faster and faster blurring as the "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then "tens", then... clink the count stops at "1". springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud. there is a pause. crash the sign is violently yanked into the ground. it vanishes into the earth and a crack appears at the edge of the road. the crack grows moving out to the center of the highway.}
<B>__{back on the street}
<A>__{jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a gurgling sound starts to build. the tar in front of jacob becomes molten. it bubbles and pops. jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt. it's a hat. the hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. a left hand burned and scarred pokes out next to it. four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side. a head is up now a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat hiding the face. the body beneath the head ascends. the veil of asphalt parts: it's freddy krueger. jacob screams. freddy laughs. he shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of springwood. a look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{payback time...}
<A>__{freddy opens his mouth lets out a large breath and then inhales an even larger one. a windstorm starts, the source being krueger's own lungs. the gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding springwood. fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards freddy's mouth and houses begin to dissolve. freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop. krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body and the entire town of springwood is going with it. trees, buildings, cars, picket fences. it's all crumbling and fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into freddy's mouth. the vortex swirls into krueger. then it's gone. nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains. freddy turns to jacob and burps, it sounds like a thunderclap.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{don't worry, i have a strong stomach.}
<A>__{freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater. he pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts and a transparent stomach. inside the stomach: a black swirling mass. flashes of houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible anguish. freddy drops down his sweater.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{springwood is mine, boy!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i dreamed you away before i was born! mom said you couldn't come back!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{is that true? then she told you all about me, huh? let's see what else she has to say.}
<A>__{freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out: alice. jacob's mother. tar dripping down her body. krueger has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her. jacob gets up and runs toward him. freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and kicks jacob back a good fifteen feet.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{run, jacob!}
<A>__{the boy rolls painful on the hard road. he sits up and screams:}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{leave her alone!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you're such a momma's boy!}
<A>__{freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, then swoops the daggers towards alice.}
<B>__{close on jacob}
<A>__{as off screen we hear a horrible multiple glitch! jacob shrieks in gut wrenching anguish.}
<B>__{wide on scene}
<A>__{we're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but close enough to see that freddy has impaled alice's body on his blades. he lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp figure right over his head. krueger swings his arm out, shaking off alice, sending her flying over jacob's head. the body lands behind him.}
<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{as he runs to his mother. she vanishes just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body. he turns to krueger and raises his fists. a look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, insane anger. he bellows:}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you fucker!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{springwood is only the beginning. all i need from you is a ride!}
<A>__{suddenly, between jacob and freddy, three shafts of light burst up from the road. three figures appear as the light dissipates. they're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with dark visors covering their faces. one is large and muscular. the one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin tight outfit. the third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face that allows us to see his mouth. they're the dream police. jacob doesn't know this yet, but freddy seems to. the bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions. then he looks past them and smiles at jacob.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{see ya later!}
<A>__{freddy violently drops down into the bubbling asphalt pit. two of the black figures start after him. the third one turns to jacob as his partners leap into the hole after freddy. the sound from his exposed mouth is deafening!}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{wake up!}
<A>__{jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:}
