<L>__{interior 221 baker st. holmes' apartments day}
<A>__{holmes walks up the stairs and finds watson's office door open. he is well into packing his things. the office is full of boxes, the walls and shelves are very sparse.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{don't forget the wallpaper.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{there isn't any.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{figure of speech.}
<A>__{holmes steps into the room.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if i employ it?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{bring him in, boys.}
<A>__{holmes steps aside. two three policemen enter carrying a large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on watson's desktop. they unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of the thug from reordon's lodging.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{who was he?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my new roommate. he's an inspiring conversationalist.}
<P>__{(alt: he has more humor than you.)}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{no, he's your friend from reordon's. he didn't survive dredger landing on him. poor fellow. but there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men.}
<A>__{watson keeps packing. holmes analyzes the body, starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and forearms of his coat. holmes grabs various instruments and other items from watson's newly packed boxes. frustrated, watson snatches them back as quickly as holmes takes them out.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. plenty of it, layer on layer...}
<A>__{holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife, examines it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{though none of it human.}
<A>__{watson slows down slightly. he keeps packing, trying to resist the mystery, but it's not easy.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{a butcher perhaps...? what else?}
<A>__{holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies the color of the flame carefully. watson wrinkles his nose at the smell.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hm predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. sulfurous. he spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin.}
<A>__{holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{coal... river silt...}
<A>__{watson slows down further, struggling.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in...}
<A>__{a hanging beat. and watson finally cracks, blurting out:}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{nine elms.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well done. now, you didn't happen to pack the lord's register of members' interests, did you?}
<A>__{watson pulls it out of a box.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{see what blackwood admits to owning.}
<A>__{as watson flips through it, holmes plucks a few chords on his violin, thinking. watson finds the page.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{something brutal by the river...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{woolwich arsenal... limehouse chemical... queenshithe slaughterhouse, nine elms!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's it, watson! this should lead us right to blackwood.}
<A>__{holmes leaps up and readies himself to leave.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{not us, you.}
<A>__{this gives holmes pause.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{right. well uh... best of luck with everything, then.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{same to you.}
<A>__{a brief nod, then holmes is gone. a beat as watson continues packing. he heaves a box up, moves for his suitcase. after a moment, he notices... holmes' pistol.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{not again.}
<A>__{he picks it up. as he contemplates the weapon, he becomes more serious. then angry. he mouths a curse to himself, and sees their dog giving him a disapproving look.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, i know. don't give me that look, gladstone.}
<A>__{he pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.}
