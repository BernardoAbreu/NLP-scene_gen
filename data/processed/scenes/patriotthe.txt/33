<L>__{interior workshop day}
<A>__{marion works the lathe. susan watches from her perch on the woodpile.}
<L>__{exterior barn day}
<A>__{the sound of a crash from inside the barn. an angry cow runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious samuel who is holding onto the cow's neck. samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt. the cow runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the bank of the river. samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the cow.}
<B>__{on the riverbank}
<A>__{as samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly approaching then retreating from the water. then he sees the cause the water in the river has a pale, pink hue. samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is. behind him, margaret sees her brother beyond the yard wall.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{samuel...}
<A>__{he doesn't respond. margaret, trailed by william, walks down toward samuel.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{samuel, get up to the house. you heard father...}
<A>__{then she sees it, too. the pale pink is turning redder and redder. and then the bodies. first one, then more, many more. torn apart. missing limbs. those with wide open wounds, are already drained of blood. others are still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water. samuel, margaret and william stand frozen, appalled and fascinated. marion steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river. he can't see what they're looking at. irritated, he walks toward them. then, as he nears the river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children. he quickens his stride, speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{up to the house, now. all of you, come on. now.}
