<L>__{interior lecture films writer's offices morning}
<A>__{with all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box, mark leaves his office, stopping in front of shelley's desk.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{i loathed almost every minute i worked for you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i often fantasized about you naked.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{what are you going to do now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i have no idea. but i have very little hope for the future.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{i don't have much hope for you either, but i wish you good luck.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{bye, shelley.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{bye, mark.}
<A>__{mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by rob marlowe, a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive clothes.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so they fucking fired you, huh dipshit? i always knew the black plague would never work as a movie. guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please don't make me feel worse. or actually whatever, go ahead, i don't think i could possibly feel worse.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i fucking always hated you. you're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. but i was always threatened by you because i knew there was something different about you that i didn't understand and i fucking hate things i don't understand. but you will always be a loser and i will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. that's just the way it is. and shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, now i feel worse.}
<A>__{rob storms off. mark slinks into the elevator and hangs his head in shame as the doors close.}
