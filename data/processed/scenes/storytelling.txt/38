<L>__{interior editing room day}
<A>__{toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{this is definitely better.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you think so? you don't think that this might not be a little dry?}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{this is entertainment you're making, toby. this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, i know...but still, it should be somewhat entertaining.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, no, no. no exploitation. this is serious...but don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{you've got a family tragedy on your hands. will you tell me what's funny about that? about a kid in a coma?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{nothing, i guess...}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ok, you're right, you're right...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, we need to screen what we've got...invite some regular people, just some random off the street types...and see what real people think of this.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i dunno, toby. we really have a long way to go. you still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ok, then we can invite serious intellectual types.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{we're not ready.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hip alternative types who will understand the process better...}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{we're not ready!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, i need to see this with an audience!}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{what's an audience going to tell you?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe they'll like it.}
