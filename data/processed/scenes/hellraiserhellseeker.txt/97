<A>__{as soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them: a large slab of marble upon which rests a human form covered with a sheet. trevor enters. he makes his way toward the body and stares at it. a low wheezing noise coming from a dark corner just beyond the slab distracts him. trevor looks and freezes when he sees: the goat laying on the floor in a pool of blood. it's still breathing. one of the goat's slatted eyes is staring at trevor as if begging for mercy. a strange ripping noise is heard. the goat mewls in pain then its eye rolls up. dead. the animal's body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its back widens spitting out streams of blood. trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open, giving birth to a rising form... pinhead. he rises completely from the goat, stepping out of the wound. he is red with blood for a second. then his skin and robe absorb the blood like a sponge. pinhead approaches trevor blocking him from the body on the slab.}

<D>__{use your mind for something other than numbers dear trevor. think about people for a change. people other than yourself. like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. you were always so confident you had covered your tracks. always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? part of you must have known she would find out. flash back:}
