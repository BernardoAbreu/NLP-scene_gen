<L>__{exterior jade palace dawn}
<A>__{at the top of the stairs, shifu looks upon the valley, awaiting his fate. with a gust of wind, tai lung appears before him.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{i have come home, master.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{this is no longer your home. and i am no longer your master.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{yes. you have a new favorite. so where is this...po? did i scare him off?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{this battle is between you and me.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{so. that is how it's going to be?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{that is how it must be.}
<A>__{they fight. at last. tai lung punches shifu clean through the doors of the jade palace. tai lung enters.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{i rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness!}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{obeying your master is not weakness!}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{you knew i was the dragon warrior! you always knew...}
<A>__{dissolve to flashback. a young tai lung looks expectant. oogway shakes his head.}
<D>__{tai lung (v.o.) (cont'd) but when oogway said otherwise, what did you do? what did you do?!}
<A>__{tai lung looks to shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{nothing!}
<A>__{shifu takes a kung fu stance.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you were not meant to be the dragon warrior! that was not my fault!}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{not your fault?!}
<A>__{enraged, tai lung knocks over the kung fu artifacts and throws them at shifu.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{who filled my head with dreams?! who drove me to train until my bones cracked?! who denied me my destiny?!}
<A>__{shifu dodges each attack.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{it was never my decision to make!}
<A>__{tai lung pulls oogway's staff from the shrine.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{it is now.}
<A>__{they fight. tai lung pins shifu down with the staff.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{give me the scroll!}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{i would rather die.}
<A>__{they struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters into a hundred pieces. shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by. caught off guard, shifu gets kicked by tai lung into a column. shifu climbs the column to the rafters. tai lung follows and sends them both crashing through the roof. lightning flash. grappling in mid air, tai lung gets his hands around shifu's throat as they crash back through the roof. they kick apart. shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard. tai lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the floor. flames go everywhere. tai lung's arms are aflame as he charges at shifu.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{all i ever did, i did to make you proud! tell me how proud you are, shifu! tell me! tell me!}
<A>__{thoom! a fiery punch sends shifu skidding across the floor and crashing against the reflecting pool. the flames extinguish and tai lung extends his claws.}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i have always been proud of you. from the first moment, i've been proud of you. and it was my pride that blinded me. i loved you too much to see what you were becoming. what i was turning you into. i'm... sorry.}
<A>__{tai lung stops in his tracks. shifu waits. tai lung's expression goes cold. he grabs shifu by the throat.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{i don't want your apology. i want my scroll!}
<A>__{he holds shifu up to the ceiling. looking up, tai lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{what? where is it?!}
<A>__{tai lung slams shifu to the floor.}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{dragon warrior has taken scroll halfway across china by now. you will never see that scroll, tai lung. never. never...}
<A>__{tai lung is furious. he roars, ready to strike shifu. suddenly...}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{tai lung turns around to find po standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{stairs...}
<A>__{tai lung casts shifu aside.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{buddy, i am the dragon warrior.}
<P>__{(exhales hard)}
<D>__{huhhh...}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{you?! him?!}
<P>__{(to shifu)}
<D>__{he's a panda.}
<P>__{(back to po)}
<D>__{you're a panda. what are you gonna do, big guy? sit on me?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{don't tempt me. haha. no. i'm gonna use this. you want it? come and get it.}
<A>__{po shows him the dragon scroll. from out of nowhere, tai lung appears and punches po across the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from po's hands.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{finally!}
<A>__{po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into tai lung, sending him flying into a column. po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as tai lung recovers and charges. po turns to run. tai lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the palace steps. po clings to the scroll as tai lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below. po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and smash tai lung. he briefly skids across the rooftop and comes right back at po.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{that scroll is mine!}
<A>__{down the theater steps, po and tai lung grapple for the scroll. po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down on tai lung's head. as they crash through the gateway the scroll is knocked loose. tai lung goes for the scroll but po snatches it away using a noodle lasso. the scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head. tai lung leaps for it, but po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see saws po into the air. in mid air, po slurps the noodle. up and over the rooftops, po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. the scroll rolls to a stop in the street. as tai lung makes his move on the scroll, po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{lightning!}
<A>__{tai lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as po uses his bamboo stilts to block tai lung. the leopard swipes out the stilts and brings po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river. po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. as tai lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see po flying through the fireworks filled sky. po slams through tai lung and crashes into a rock wall. the scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. he looks back at tai lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. via the magic of cookie vision, po effortlessly scales the building. tai lung is shocked.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{the scroll has given him power.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{nooo0!!}
<A>__{he takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. the resulting shockwave collapses the building. amazingly, po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid air as tai lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends po smashing into the ground. as tai lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch. as the dust settles, tai lung is looming over po in the impact crater.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{finally... oh yes... the power of the dragon scroll... is mine!}
<A>__{tai lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. his face falls.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{it's nothing!!}
<A>__{po stirs.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{it's okay. i didn't get it the first time either.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{po gets to his feet.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{there is no secret ingredient. it's just you.}
<A>__{tai lung snarls and lunges at po.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{rrraaah!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{aaaaggghh!}
<A>__{tai lung attacks po's nerve points. but po begins giggling.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{stop! stop it! i'm gonna pee! don't! don't!}
<A>__{tai lung's nerve attack has no effect on po. frustrated, he delivers a double fisted punch to po's belly. the shockwave ripples through po's entire body and po's arms come back and strike tai lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building. po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did. tai lung rises from the rubble and runs at po again. but po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda style technique, even getting tai lung to chomp down on his own tail. po gives tai lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. tai lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at po. but po prepares... and tai lung is swiftly met by po's iron belly! he is launched into the air. po waits... and waits... until finally, tai lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground. tai lung is battered, but still defiant.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<P>__{(heavy breathing)}
<D>__{you... can't defeat me. you're just a big, fat panda!}
<A>__{schwing! po grabs tai lung's finger. tai lung's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i'm not a big, fat panda. i'm the big, fat panda.}
<A>__{po's pinky pops up. tai lung gasps.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{the wuxi finger hold!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh, you know this hold?}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{you're bluffing. you're bluffing! shifu didn't teach you that.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{nope. i figured it out.}
<A>__{he flexes his pinky...}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{skadoosh!}
<A>__{ka thoom!}
