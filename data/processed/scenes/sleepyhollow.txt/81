<L>__{exterior western woods, tree of the dead later day}
<A>__{rain. young masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his knees. he's watching the tree. behind him, katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a pile of mud. ichabod hands up the shovel.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{masbath, we've found it.}
<A>__{young masbath goes to the grave. ichabod pulls at thick burlap cloth, straining as it comes away. ichabod looks down, disbelieving.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{it cannot be true.}
<A>__{we see: roots have gripped the horseman's bones and tattered uniform. the skeleton is all there except the skull.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{the skull is gone.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{yes. i did notice that, thank you.}
<A>__{ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit. lightning. thunder. he stares at the bones.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{this is his silent shrieking... and his desire, to reclaim his head.}
<A>__{ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{"he who holds fast the horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand."}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{someone controls the horseman.}
<C>__{katrina }
<D>__{ichabod!}
<A>__{ichabod turns, looks... katrina and young masbath back away, because the roots in the grave are alive, further entwining around remains. ichabod spins to the twisted tree... the vertical suture seethes, pulling inwards... sucking philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling. ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening katrina and young masbath along as he flees. at the tree, the suture swells. ichabod, katrina and young masbath pass where their freaking horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover. a rumbling is heard from the twisted tree, which suddenly bursts wide, spitting smoldering cinders. at the tree line, ichabod, katrina and young masbath cower, looking back. from the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the headless horseman and daredevil explode into existence... they hit the ground running. ichabod watches the horseman ride away with bolts of lightning striking the ground behind. the horseman disappears in the forest.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{his next victim is chosen!}
<P>__{(to masbath)}
<D>__{give me distance, then guide her back to the hollow.}
<A>__{ichabod runs towards the horses.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{constable!}
