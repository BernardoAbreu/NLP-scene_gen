<L>__{exterior mccall house night}
<A>__{through the windows, we see quincy enter the house. he glances around, then walks to the living room. he sees his mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn up. he pulls open the sliding glass door. nona jumps, then sees quincy. she quickly puts her drink down.}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{you scared me.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{sorry. you okay?}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{quincy glances at her half hidden glass.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{last time i remember you drinking was when marvin gaye died.}
<A>__{no response from nona.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{this about dad?}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{guess he talked to you.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{don't sweat it, okay. sooner or later the truth'll come out.}
<C>__{nona}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{whose truth are you talking about?}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.}
<A>__{she doesn't respond. quincy studies her.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{i mean, you believe him, right?}
<A>__{nona sits silent, humiliated.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{just...leave it alone.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{this is just about money, you know that.}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{quincy, please...}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{i mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{guess i should have been telling your father.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{so you're gonna take the word of some trick over pop's? he wouldn't lie.}
<A>__{nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him. confused, quincy opens it. he pulls out a couple of photos: zeke outside a party. in one photo, his arm is around a young woman. in another photo, they kiss. and yet another, they climb into his car.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{what...what's this?}
<C>__{nona}
<D>__{i hired somebody. how pathetic is that? after all his late nights and "meetings" and i still needed proof.}
<A>__{quincy just stares at the photos.}
<C>__{nona }
<D>__{i used to think i was lucky just to be married to zeke mccall, but i'm too tired.}
<A>__{quincy looks stricken, but he moves to nona, comforts her as she cries... exterior track night monica sits with a devastated quincy, high up in the bleachers. in the distance, the clock tower glows 10:50.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time i'm hanging on his every word like he's god or something...}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{what has he been to me? i mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. like it was easy.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{and i'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{she understands.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{he even had me wanting to play for the "clippers." man, how stupid am i.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you're not stupid.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{i know a lot of brothers dog their wives, i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...}
<A>__{monica puts her arms around him. they sit there, quiet. monica glances up at the clock tower. she reacts. quincy notices.}
<C>__{quincy }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{nothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't we walk to my dorm?}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{i'm not up for running into anybody. let's just kick it here, alright?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i...can't.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. if i'm late, i don't suit up.}
<A>__{quincy looks at her, almost in shock.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{didn't realize you were watching the clock.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i mean, i can stay a few more minutes.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{nah. don't sweat it.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{quincy...}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{for real. i should be alone, anyway.}
<A>__{monica reluctantly stands.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{will you call me when you get in?}
<A>__{quincy nods. monica gives him a kiss. then she turns and crosses away.}
