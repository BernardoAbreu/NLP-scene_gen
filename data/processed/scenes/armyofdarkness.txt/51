<L>__{exterior mill}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the mill, halting ash's view. ash races for the mill.}
<L>__{interior mill}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{races through the door and toward camera when...smash...ash's reflection shatters. he's run into a mirror. shivering, he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass. he moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames, camera pans to....}
<B>__{the shattered mirror pieces}
<A>__{each piece of mirror reflects an image of ash. from the eight pieces of mirror spring...}
<B>__{eight tiny ashes}
<A>__{two inch high versions of himself. they leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire. tiny ash #1, #2, and #3 grab a discarded dinner fork. like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it into ash's buttocks.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{screams in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the stove pipe. tiny ash #4, #5, and #6 lift the barrel of the shotgun in ash's direction. another leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. boom!}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off.}
<B>__{the tiny ashes}
<A>__{shriek with uncontrollable laughter. they jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the floor.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it. tiny ash #1 is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry him. tracking shot the fork a giant projectile as it roars at camera. pan with it as it whooshes past. fa thong!}
<B>__{the fork}
<A>__{skewers tiny ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front of him by other tiny ashes. his head slams into a stove pipe. he crumples. he lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove. ssssssssss. he pries his face loose with a spatula.}
<B>__{a bucket of grease}
<A>__{is pushed off a high shelf. clang! it lands on ash's head and spills slippery grease about the floor.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{with an upside down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back and forth on the grease. he stands and tries to dislodge the bucket. he trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his path. he falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it. bucket headed ash screams and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe. clang! ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks. he looks about for the little imps. tiny ash #2 crouching behind a log attempting to hide. but...}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{has seen him. he "accidentally" elbows the log and tiny ash #2 into the stove's fire.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{ooops.}
<A>__{tiny ash #2 is burned alive.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet. tiny ash #3 is dashing across the open expanse of floor. ash's gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man. tiny ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot. rip!!}
<B>__{the nail rips}
<A>__{through ash's shoe.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{jerks his leg upward in pain. ash dances about the place hopping on one foot, howling. he strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by tiny ashes #6, #7 and #8. he almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor. blackness.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{awakens on the floor of the mill, like gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. directly above him, on the edge of a table... tiny ashes #4 and #5 suspend tiny ash #6 by his legs. tiny ash #7 and #8 stand atop ash's face. they push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. ash's mouth opens as he gasps for air. as he inhales... suspended tiny ash #6 is released. tiny ash #6 slow motion wind fan he free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into ash's opened throat.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{inhales the living beast whole. he chokes violently. he breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. he puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail. he looks about to crush some of the little ashes but they are gone. he places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair. he goes pale.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{nasty little thing's inside me.}
<A>__{he stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.}
<D>__{well let's see how you like a little hot water!}
<A>__{he grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat. he sets down the kettle and waits for a moment. a tiny scream emits from ash's stomach}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{emits a bark of laughter. he clutches as his chest. then his arm. he rips back his shirt sleeve. close on ash's arm stop motion animation we can see the outline of tiny ash #6's body squirming down ash's arm, just beneath the skin.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{watches in horror as...}
<B>__{the tiny figure}
<A>__{squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand. the iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. the possessed iron hand swings at him.}
<B>__{the iron hand}
<A>__{connects with an uppercut that knocks ash out of frame.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{lands next to an iron vice. he reaches for the evil hand. but the hand has grabbed a mallet that bonk bonks him on the head. ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice.}
<B>__{the evil iron hand}
<A>__{cranks the vice's handle.}
<B>__{the vice}
<A>__{tightens around ash's head. trapped, he looks to...}
<B>__{the evil hand}
<A>__{rummaging through a wooden toolbox. it comes upon a crude wooden punch. angle the evil hand undercranked stabs rapidly at ash's good hand. but ash expertly dodges each stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb is super fast motion.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{with is head still wedged in the vice.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{why you dirty little...ahhhhhh!!}
<B>__{a pair of iron pliers}
<A>__{has entered frame and clamps down upon ash's nose. he emits a nasal scream and shakes the pliers loose.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{soon as i get out of this thing i... yieeee!!}
<B>__{the pair of iron pliers}
<A>__{dip into ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{no! not the teeth!}
<A>__{yank!}
<B>__{the evil hand}
<A>__{jerks his rear molar from his head and holds up the tooth for his inspection. it sets the tooth down nearly in front of him. the evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust. it scurries from view. ash's head struggling in the grip of the vice.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{where the hell are ya!?}
<B>__{the evil hand}
<A>__{grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{i can't see ya!!}
<B>__{his evil hand}
<A>__{raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the right half of his body.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{no, no not the poke }
<A>__{sssssssssssss!}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{jerks his head free from the vice with a scream. he holds up his iron hand. it's back to normal. again under his control.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{okay then.}
<A>__{but he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: his shoulder itches. he scratches it. the itch grows. it itches madly. he rips back his shirt. upon his shoulder... there blinks a third eyeball!!!}
<B>__{the camera races into this hideous sight}
<A>__{it is the eyeball of evil ash. beneath it, a mouth and nose begin to take shape on the surface of ash's back.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{shrieks and shrieks and races out of the mill. the camera follows him in docu horror style as he flees into the dark woods.}
