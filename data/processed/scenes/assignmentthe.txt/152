<D>__{this isn't the place for this conversation.}

<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{excuse me sir... i only wanted to know where i could buy a newspaper.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{go over there by the phone booths and wait... i will come to you.}
<A>__{ramirez gets up casually. angle on amos he has heard everything that has gone down. angle on koj he waits, standing a few feet away and not by the phones as he was told. he watches ramirez. something doesn't jibe... passwords were not exchanged. he crosses to ramirez's side.}
<C>__{koj}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{excuse me sir... i asked if you knew where i could buy a newspaper.}
<A>__{ramirez stops for a moment. he knows that the line is some kind of code and he has no response to give so he starts up walking again. koj is instantly behind ramirez, his hand going into his flight bag and pushing the flight bag up against ramirez's back.}
<C>__{koj}
<D>__{make the slightest move and i shoot... and i don't miss. walk to the rest room, very carefully.}
<A>__{ramirez does as he is told.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{amos. he watches it all going down in the back of a chrome napkin holder. he slowly gets up, looks around for jack and goes out into the corridor and sees koj and ramirez going into the rest room. koj sees one of those sandwich board signs off to the side which says, "lavatory temporarily closed for cleaning." he pulls it in front of the door.}
