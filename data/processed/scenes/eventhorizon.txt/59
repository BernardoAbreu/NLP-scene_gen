<L>__{exterior event horizon lewis and clark model}
<A>__{the lewis and clark carefully maneuvers in close to the event horizon's airlock. a mechanical boom arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the event horizon. its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster. the cluster buckles under the stress.}

<P>__{(to weir)}
<D>__{it is now.}
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{we're locked in.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{starck, give me a read.}
<A>__{a scan of the event horizon appears across starck's screen.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{the reactor's still hot. we've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. nothing serious.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{do they have pressure?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{affirmative. the hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. i'm showing deep cold. the crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{find 'em, starck.}
<A>__{starck frowns at her display.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{something's wrong with the bio scan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{radiation interference?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{there's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. i'm picking up trace life forms, but i can't get a lock on the location.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{could it be the crew? if they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{if they were in stasis, i'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. it doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{okay. we do it the hard way. deck by deck, room by room. starck, deploy the umbilicus. i believe you're up for a walk, mr. justin. go get your bonnet on.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{yes, sir!}
<A>__{weir starts to follow justin from the bridge.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{dr. weir, i need you on the bridge.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{captain, i didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, i need to be on that ship...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board }
<C>__{weir}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{that is not acceptable }
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{ once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i need you to guide us from the comm station. this is where i need you. help us to do our job.}
<A>__{weir exhales.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{very well.}
