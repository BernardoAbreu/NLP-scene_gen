<L>__{interior lobby of apartment building morning}
<A>__{we hear a smack off camera and a ping as the elevator door opens. the model storms off and a stunned fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.}
<L>__{exterior courtroom , morning}
<A>__{a shaky fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he is accosted by a beggar.}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{any change, mister?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{but he continues walking.}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{could you spare some?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{unquestionably.}
<A>__{fletcher walks faster, puzzled that he has answered truthfully. the beggar is even more puzzled.}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{will you?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{because i resent your p re sen ce. you fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. further, i don't believe you'll use the money for food, but i believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or cigarettes. also, i'm cheap.}
<A>__{as fletcher heads up the stairs...}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{jerkoff.}
