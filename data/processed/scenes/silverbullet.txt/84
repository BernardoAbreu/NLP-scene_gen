<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh my dear god... stella!}
<A>__{she runs for the doorway and the hall. from upstairs comes a confusion of sounds: roars, breaking furniture, shattering glass.}
<L>__{interior stella's bed, cu}
<A>__{one of those deadly claw hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself. hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.}
<L>__{exterior stella's window, extreme up angle}
<A>__{the werewolf leaps out it's graceful, savage, animal. sound: a triumphant howl.}
<L>__{interior the upstairs hall, with mother}
<A>__{she's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it gamely along.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{stella!...stella!}
<A>__{she reaches the closed door of stella's room, vacillates there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in. a long beat of silence as we hold on the door.}
<B>__{mother shrieks.}
