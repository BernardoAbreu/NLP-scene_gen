<L>__{interior bedroom in salieri's apartment day 1780's}
<A>__{a somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study. we see a four poster bed. also, a marble mantelpiece above which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure of a severe christ. opposite this image sits salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink. on one side of him is an open forte piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty. he scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair which we see without a powdered wig. there is a knock at the door.}

<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{grazie, signore.}
<A>__{he inclines his head to the christ above the fireplace, and starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which pleased him.}
