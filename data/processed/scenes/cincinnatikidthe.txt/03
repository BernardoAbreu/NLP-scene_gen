<A>__{the eight men gathered here in a game of five card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the sounds of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley. in fact the noise is so loud that the dealer of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{somebody shut the goddam window. let a man think.}
<A>__{the player nearest the window shuts it. the dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. except for the cincinnati kid, the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you. the man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named danny, and he and the kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each. no other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot. only four men are left in the hand.}

<D>__{you seen my hole card, you bastard!}
<P>__{(indicating dealer)}
<D>__{he was dealing them high.}
<A>__{attending to first things first, the kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. now as danny accuses him again, the kid looks him squarely in the face.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you stole that dough.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them buster.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
