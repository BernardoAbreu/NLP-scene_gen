<L>__{3.2 enjoys the attention.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{she's some of your finest work, daryl.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{all my work is my finest.}
<A>__{sid 6.7 continues appreciating sheila 3.2. as reilly races back in, the monitors then all go black. reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's head. he dangles the snake right in front of lindenmeyer's face. terrifying him.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(backing away fast)}
<D>__{get that fucking thing away from me!}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you're...such a wimp.}
<A>__{he grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake. the half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving. but the half still in reilly's hand begins regenerating a new tail. literally growing a new one. lindenmeyer can't believe his eyes. he studies the snake closely.}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(in awe)}
<D>__{it's nanotechnology, isn't it? machines the size of molecules...}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{coordinated by polymer neural net.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(touching the snake)}
<D>__{it feels so.. .real.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{it's better than real. it's synthetic flesh. synthetic blood. synthetic organs...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's a physiological machine.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(awed)}
<D>__{this is supposed to be years away.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{as far as the public is concerned, it is. the reason you got fired, and i got my second demo into production, is i'm a lot smarter than you. i never give my best stuff away.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(restraining himself)}
<D>__{how do you kill it?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{separate the character module from the neural net...}
<A>__{using lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net. the snake stops moving. it "dies."}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{... and you get nanodeath.}
<P>__{(discarding the snake)}
<D>__{don't worry, i've got a bunch of other ones.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{amazing. i hate to say it, but it is.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. if you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. and bring the sheila 3.2 character module with you...}
<A>__{he exits. as lindenmeyer reaches for the sheila 3.2 character module, sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and winks.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{you catching my drift?}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{i think i understand what you have in mind...}
<A>__{peeling the label off the sid 6.7 character module, lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. sid 6.7 disappears from the screen.}
