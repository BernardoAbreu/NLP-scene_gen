<L>__{exterior palace grounds night, saudi time}
<A>__{three suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive, walled palace. impersonal wealth. two dozen sang troops on security detail. two humvees equipped with anti aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart. colonel al ghazi out of the middle suburban. frisked by sang, rough: no love lost.}
<L>__{interior impersonal palace same moment}
<A>__{al ghazi is passed to a silent, boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea. a mammoth foyer. prince sa'ad bin khaled (saudi interior ministry) steps out from a 20 foot high doorway: nebbish, thin, bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses. his hand over his stomach: napoleon's ulcers. a quick wave to al ghazi.}
