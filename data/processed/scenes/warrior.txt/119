<L>__{exterior atlantic city day}
<A>__{fourth of july weekend in full swing down the shore.}
<L>__{interior hotel room same}
<A>__{paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained v neck, clutching his walkman and a bottle of whiskey. "moby dick" plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off. liquor bottles are strewn everywhere. he has obviously fallen off the wagon. hard.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{god pity `em! all shall perish except me! you bastards! stop the ship, you bastards!}
<A>__{he staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to no audience.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{ishmael! god pity `em! stop the ship! please stop the ship! somebody help `em!}
<A>__{suddenly the adjoining door swings open. tommy, hair disheveled, looks in and sees paddy's state. the old man thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at tommy.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{ahab! you godless sonofabitch!}
<A>__{paddy staggers over and gets in tommy's face, his own face blotched and contorted. the old paddy conlon revealed. the monster from the past.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{you stop the ship, you godless sonofabitch!}
<A>__{there's no anger in tommy. he simply walks toward the old man and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. as he struggles to take it, the walkman falls to the ground. faint dialogue is heard coming from the earphones.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{captain. oh captain. stop the ship. for the love of god. we're lost.}
<A>__{the old man is running out of steam. he begins weeping.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{please stop the ship.}
<A>__{paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. tommy looks at him. the first time we've seen anything resembling compassion on that relentless face of his. he hugs his father and pries the whiskey bottle from his hand}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{we're lost. we're all lost, tommy. we'll never make it back.}
<A>__{tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. puts his arms around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. it's a tender moment, and it seems as if tommy is only able to relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.}
<C>__{paddy }
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{i always loved you. you know that, don't you tommy? i always loved you. you and your brother. my two boys.}
<A>__{tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into the room. the end of a very long night.}
