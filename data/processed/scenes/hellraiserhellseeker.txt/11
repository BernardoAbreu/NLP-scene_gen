<A>__{trevor starts nodding out. the bus is practically empty. two black children a boy and a girl sit across from trevor. a creepy old woman sits further back, knitting something. a church bell ringing causes trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. as the church passes the bell becomes louder and louder. trevor hears laughter and looks up at the children. the girl and her brother seem to be play fighting over a toy they hold between them. trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that.}
