<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{our old german couple are dancing wonderfully in each other's arms inspiring. pan a dozen really old couples dancing to the three piece filipino ensemble, until we come to... gin and mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the surrounding geezers that they are very much in love. we close to hear their sweet murmurings...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{and the meal...?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{my contract. with debeers.}
<A>__{she blinks. hit by a ton of bricks.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh my g...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{sensible folks, debeers. a world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle...something's only priceless if it's scarce.}
<A>__{he whirls her in a tight spin. the geriatic germans can only watch and envy.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{these guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them out of circulation. otherwise, you could buy 'em at the five and dime...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{watch the old guy stuff, they don't have dimestores anym...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{imagine the chaos we could cause.}
<A>__{she is imagining.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you said 'contract'...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{we're sort of bounty hunters.}
<A>__{gin likes the ring of that. green eyes dance with delight.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{our machine is worth far more dead. than alive.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{glad to see you're both alive.}
<A>__{they look over. the officious steward from this afternoon. now in black tie.}
<C>__{steward}
<D>__{when you missed cocktails. and supper. i thought of knocking on your door...}
<A>__{mac turns gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh, i wish you had. we love having strangers join us! maybe later ...?}
<A>__{mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward across her bare shoulder...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{promise you an interesting time...}
<A>__{trademark smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{or my name's not banquo macduff.}
