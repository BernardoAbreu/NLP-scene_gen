<L>__{exterior ocean}
<A>__{the orca and its song in the night. in the foreground, the barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards the ship.}
<L>__{interior pilot house}
<A>__{the song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. quint's eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to hear the abrasion of his ship. things vibrate on the shelves. quint stops singing, hooper and brody continue a duet. the scraping repeats, and hooper now senses it. he drops out of the song, leaving brody singing solo.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(quietly, to hooper)}
<D>__{start the engines.}
<A>__{as brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the vessel. water bubbles up into the hold. brody starts, and looks at the radio. he is about to move towards it when quint's urgent instructions stop him.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{he's busting the shaft! start the pump!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where...?}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{the bilge pumps. there }
<A>__{he leaves brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, grabbing his m 1 rifle as he goes. brody hits a switch and we hear the pumps starting.}
<B>__{angle on the orca}
<A>__{hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the diesels sound wrong.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{cut the engines!}
<A>__{hooper does.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{rudder bearings?}
<A>__{the boat is assaulted again. quint fires over the stern, emptying a clip into the water.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{get up forward! watch for him!}
<A>__{brody moves cautiously up to the bow.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{keep your eyes open, mr. hooper!}
<A>__{hooper stands ready on the bridge, quint pacing the stern deck.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{nobody sleeps! nobody.}
<A>__{he jams a fresh clip into the m 1. the men scan the seas around them. quint resumes their song, louder this time, more defiant.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{show me the way to go home... i'm tired and i want to go to bed.}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<A>__{hooper and brody join in from their respective positions.}
