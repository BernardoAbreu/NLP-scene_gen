<A>__{we see her flickering shadow and then coraline appears behind the entry curtains. she steps close, pulls the curtain open. song stops. pov on theater, quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains. she spots usher's flashlight on the ground. on coraline she picks it up, clicks it on, and steps forward. she sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then hears something overhead. she aims flashlight up and startles a nest of bat dogs half scotties half bats. one bares his teeth and growls. she clicks off the light and shivers. on stage, one spotlight and footlights fade up : on a huge, wrapped saltwater taffy. it hangs from ropes and sandbags. she cautiously climbs up onto the stage. a human sized taffy thing striped pale pink and green can just be seen through the wrapper. she holds her triangle candy with hole to her eye. there is a blue white glow coming from inside the wrapper. coraline punches a hole through the paper, steels herself, then reaches inside. she touches something sticky and cold and inhuman. clenching her teeth, she grabs hold and pulls out two clasped together cold, taffy hands young spink and forcible's. her heart thumps. she pries the taffy hands open like scallop shells until a large pearl on a ring is revealed.}

<A>__{coraline, desperate, gets an idea. she clicks on her flashlight and aims it at the bat dogs. they growl with annoyance, open their wings. the taffy monster is getting closer! coraline hurls the flashlight at the bat dogs and hits them. angered, they take wing to attack her just like she planned! bat dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on the right! she waits to the very last second, and then dives out of the way! bat dogs and taffy monster collide! coraline's hand is released by the taffy hands, leaving her the pearl. the bat dogs and taffy monster stuck together and still as stone turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and theater. the pearl in coraline's hand pulses blue.}
