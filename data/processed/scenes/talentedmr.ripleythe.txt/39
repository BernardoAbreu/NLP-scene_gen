<L>__{interior dickie's house. night.}
<A>__{a new icebox, incongruous in pride of place in the living room, casts its glow on a delighted dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers, handing one to ripley who is paging through his copy of the collected works of shakespeare.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i could fuck this icebox i love it so much.}
<P>__{(considering ripley)}
<D>__{what were you actually doing in new york?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i played piano in a few places.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{that's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{a few places that's a few jobs. anyway, i don't want to think about new york.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{the mysterious mr ripley. marge and i spend hours speculating.}
<P>__{(drinking)}
<D>__{cold beer. thank you dad.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{copy out from here...}
<A>__{he hands the book to dickie, pointing out the lines.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(staring to write on the back of a postcard)}
<D>__{i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes. ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. is that true?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no! i've got more than one shirt!}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{she can do that stuff for you. anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.}
<P>__{(he's finished writing)}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{now your signature.}
<P>__{(watching him write)}
<D>__{not "dickie". your signature.}
<A>__{dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard. ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean them. dickie looks at him.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{without the glasses you're not even ugly.}
<P>__{(takes them, tries them on)}
<D>__{i don't need them because i never read. how do i look.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{like clark kent.}
<P>__{(takes them back, puts them on beaming at dickie)}
<D>__{now superman.}
<A>__{dickie cuffs him. ripley looks down at the postcard.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i know. i write like a child.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{pretty vile. see this: the s and the t , do you see? fine, vulnerable that's pain, that's secret pain.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{it must be a deep secret, cause i don't know about it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your handwriting nothing more naked. see nothing's quite touching the line that's vanity.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{well we certainly know that's true.}
