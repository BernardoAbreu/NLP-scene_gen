<L>__{interior confessional booth night}
<A>__{beth lays in jam's arms on the floor. they might as well be the only two people on the face of the earth. they whisper.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{so. is it true that gene simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? y'know, to make it so long?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i dunno. i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. i'm not too up on gene trivia.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{your man is the drummer, peter criss, right?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{peter criss is my inspiration, man. if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo, i'd consider it... money... hey, how'd you know that?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i have all your notebook doodles memorized, jam... here.}
<A>__{she opens her backpack and pulls out a package addressed to jam. the return address reads: beth bumsteen, somewhere in ann arbor.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{ann arbor?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{my dad's company is relocating him. we're moving. that's why i was acting so freaky in school today. i thought it was the last time i'd ever see you. anyway, open the box. i would have given it to you this morning, except... like i said, i was freaking out.}
<A>__{jam opens the box and his jaw drops. it's a black tee shirt with the "mystery" logo printed in white on the chest. jam holds it up. it's gigantic.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i pass by this really cool tee shirt shop on my way to school every day and i know you wear those black tee shirts all the time. you look like a size thirty five, but all the sizes were in roman numerals. so i got you an xxxl. that's thirty five, isn't it?}
<A>__{touched, jam kisses her for a long time. he starts putting on the shirt when suddenly they hear the shuffling of the priest entering his booth. jam grabs his clothes and sits back on the bench. beth starts getting dressed at his feet.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. my patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(pulling up his pants)}
<D>__{alright, father, here it is. about two weeks ago i went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{beth is tying her shoes. jam slips on his socks.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i was insulted, so i asked her if i was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{oh, this is terrible... please go on.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{well, she was a very tempting siren, father. built like you wouldn't believe. so i gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.}
<A>__{jam pauses.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{well? continue! continue!}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{was it a teddy?}
<A>__{fully dressed, beth crawls out of the confessional.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{no. much bet... i mean, much more sinful than that.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{a bustier?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{tell you what. you keep guessing and i will say something when you get it.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{splendid! i love a good game of name that nightie.}
<A>__{jam quietly sneaks out.}
