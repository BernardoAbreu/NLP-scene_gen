<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{now hurry, hurry. i will watch! your desires may be my pleasure also...our fitting climax to an evening's enter tainment. you must...hurry now.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, gazing back at criswell seductively. she finally gets to shirley and cuts the button off of shirley's shirt, which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway. she unsnaps the front of shirley's bra. bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely stepping forward. he is instantly hammer fisted on the back of the neck by the wolf man, and falls down unconscious. the princess of darkness raises her long dagger high above shirley's head. but suddenly, the sun rises (it is already high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power. the princess of darkness clings to shirley's arm, as she slowly sinks down to the ground, losing all strength. the camera pans around, showing shirley and bob's faces, then back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming skeletons. only their clothing and bones remain. quick zoom in on criswell's throne. criswell's steaming skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.}
