<A>__{laterally tracking down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead. pedestrians look up. all except one man who continues walking. this is jim prideaux. across the street: more pedestrians. we're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at the short stocky man? the girl in the mini skirt? the man in the checked jacket? a car driving beside prideaux accelerates out of the frame. across the street the girl in the mini skirt peels off into a shop. the stocky man turns and waves to us. but it isn't prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands. now we're left with prideaux and the magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other. just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby. he looks over and sees prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. a tiny moment of contact between the two. then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...}

<A>__{a formerly grand arcade. many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. a cafe occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. a jazz rock band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast feeding, the hum of chatter. the ordinary world. we find prideaux and the magyar sitting at one of the tables.}

<D>__{would you excuse me a moment?}
<A>__{he starts to walk towards the exit of the galeria. behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a crash, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling. the waiter starts, turns, sees prideaux leaving. panic flashes across his face, he draws a gun from the back of his belt, aims after prideaux and fires the shot echoing in the cavernous space. the shot misses, ricocheting off the tiled wall and prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus an image from a surreal nightmare: the other customers stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. we hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in russian.}
