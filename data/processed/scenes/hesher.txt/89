<A>__{tj & nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree lined street eating ice cream cones. they walk in the middle of the road, still damp. the sun is setting. the light is magical.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{my shoes are so squishy.}
<A>__{tj steps hard, squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes. nicole smiles.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{so, what's his name?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{hesher.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{hesher?... is that a name?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{does he have a last name?}
<C>__{tj}

<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{that was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car. i was freaking out. i don't really have any insurance right now. i just can't afford it. there's no way i could afford to fix that guy's car. how do people do this stuff? i mean, i have a job. it's kind of a joke though. i've been there for like a year and i'm still only doing like five hours a week. why aren't they giving me any more hours? do you think it's because they think i suck? did you think i sucked when i served you at the checkout?}
<C>__{tj}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent. i'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon.}
<A>__{tj licks his ice cream, then reaches into his pocket.}

<D>__{here, i got two bucks.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{the sad thing is i could actually use it.}
