<L>__{interior jack's flat day}
<A>__{working at his computer, jack lights one cigarette from another. he pauses from his typing. on the desk beside him is the note with jani's phone number. he picks up the phone, starts to dial, then stops, replaces the receiver. he looks distracted, lost. on the table marion's flowers are dead in the vase.}
<L>__{interior bookstore day}
<A>__{jack comes downstairs from the upper floor. he is looking at a book he has selected: 'scarne on cards'. across from the cash desk near the entrance a book signing is in progress. a small crowd surrounds a middle eastern author called habib dressed in a kaftan. giles is with him. a photographer is there. a few camera flashes. giles sees jack at the cash desk. he is uncertain for a moment, then smiles.}
