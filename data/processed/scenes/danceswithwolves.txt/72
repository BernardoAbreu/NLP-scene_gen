<A>__{a teenaged boy, smiles a lot and his two buddies otter and worm lie prone outside ten bears' home. they are peeking under the tipi's rolled up sides. their eyes are wide, for inside there's plenty to see and hear. the village's most influential warriors have squeezed into the lodge for this big and important meeting}
<L>__{interior ten bears' lodge night}
<A>__{the eldest and most respected men of the band, including ten bears, his pal stone calf, an influential warrior named wind in his hair, and kicking bird are seated around the fire. crowded around them, in a high state of excitement, are the village's leading warriors. the meeting is in progress.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{he might be a god or he might be a special chief that's why we are thinking of having a talk with him.}
<A>__{there is a little murmuring around the fire, and it goes silent. wind in his hair rises to speak.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{i do not care for this talk about a white man. whatever kind of white man he is, he is not sioux and that makes him less. we've camped here for ten days now and each day our scouts find nothing. one old bull with wolves tearing him apart, nothing more. we need meat not talk.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{you are right, we need meat today and tomorrow. but we must also have meat in ten years.}
<A>__{kicking bird pauses here. everyone is listening attentively.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{but the whites are coming. our friends the shoshone and the kiowa, even our enemies, agree on this the whites are coming. more than can be counted.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{kicking bird is always looking ahead and that is good. but when i hear that more whites are coming more than can be counted i want to laugh. we took a hundred horses from these people, there was no honor in it. they don't ride well, they don't shoot well, they're dirty. they have no women, no children. they could not even make it through one winter in our country. and these people are said to flourish? i think they will all be dead in ten years.}
<A>__{there is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and wind in his hair is riding the crest of it.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{i think this white man is probably lost.}
<A>__{this parting shot prompts a good natured round of laughter.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{wind in his hair has spoken straight, his words are strong and i have heard them. it's true the whites are a poor race and it's hard to understand them. but when i see one white man alone, without fear in our country, i do not think he is lost. i think he may have medicine. i see someone who might speak for all the white people who are coming. i think this is a person with which treaties might be struck.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{this white man cannot cover our lodges, or string our bows, or feed our children. i will take some good men... there are many here tonight. we will ride to the soldier fort, we will shoot some arrows into this white man. if he truly has medicine he will not be hurt. if he has no medicine he will be dead.}
<A>__{this is the best idea so far and there is much talk around the fire. they quiet down as ten bears prepares to speak.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{it is easy to become confused by these questions. it is hard to know what to do. no man can tell another how he will be. but i know this... killing a white man is a delicate matter. if you kill one, more are sure to come. we should talk about this some more.}
<A>__{he drops his head, closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep. the meeting is over.}
