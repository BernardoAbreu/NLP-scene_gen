<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{hippy trudges along the dark corridor. he reaches the men's head and goes in. as the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor b.g. it 'looks' left and right. then extends the length of the corridor, holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.}
<L>__{interior trimodule b ladderwell bunkroom mess hall}
<A>__{looking down three levels through the central ladderwell between the cylinders. the pseudopod enters and undulates upward. from inside the makeshift bunkroom, we see its tip extend inside. sonny and one night are snoring, oblivious. jammer is still unconscious. the pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on. in the mess hall, it's dark and quiet. lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table. the shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence. it sways gracefully in to air, searching. it undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything. it moves past lindsey. sensing something, she lifts her head, turning... sees the apparition next to her. her eyes go wide. amazement, but not fear. the tentacle is moving on, still searching. lindsey shakes bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth. bud blinks twice, then freezes. when she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon. bud chucks his pillow are catfish, on the next table. catfish cracks one eye open. turns away. turns right back... both eyes open now. sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them. it seems to recognize lindsey. it doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her. she holds her ground, fascinated. the bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face. it is water, still clear and undulating... but definitely lindsey. she gasps in surprise. the liquid lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression. lindsey laughs involuntarily. it laughs... without sound. lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue... testing it. the liquid lindsey does the same. bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty will, considering.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i think it likes you.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{it's trying to communicate.}
<A>__{her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of bud's. she reaches out her hand slowly. gingerly, her fingers touch the surface. ripples extend outward from the contact, across bud's features. her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways. she draws her wet fingers out and studies them, amazed. touches one fingertip to her tongue.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{seawater.}
<A>__{the pseudopod pulls back from her. it loops in the air dramatically, full circle... and ties itself into a knot. as the knot tightens down, it melts back into the body. the 'disappearing knot' trick. lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show. she is transported.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{show off.}
<A>__{she looks at bud. he grins broadly. he's with her now. the stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room. out to the corridor}
