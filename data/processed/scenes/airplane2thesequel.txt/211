<A>__{joe bolts. passengers panic. ted tackles him. the case flies into the air in slow motion. it turns slowly, hanging for the longest time as we cut, still in slow motion, to horrified faces watching it. this slow motion sequence lasts for about 60 seconds people put on make up, do macrame, read, etc. while the case is still in the air. suddenly, scraps leaps high into the air in slow motion and comes down with the case between his teeth.}
