<L>__{interior burke's master bedroom day}
<A>__{burke sits on the edge of the bed, fearful. he sees her.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{oh, i thought you took off in the middle of the night.}
<A>__{she moves quickly to him.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{no. i just had to call home. is that why you're sad?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{no. it's everett. this kid who used to work for me. he was always crazy to do his own movie.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(fearing worst)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(very down)}
<D>__{his movie not only opened to a three million dollar friday it's gotten great reviews.}
<A>__{nan is dumbfounded; still she puts a hand on him, actually consoling him for his hideous thought hollywood lovers: he, wrapped up with ill thoughts of others; she, feeling intimate, yet severely compromised. cupid's work is done.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{listen. i'm tremendously worried about 'ground zero' because of the bad 'want to sees' you sent over. but that's just me being nervous over nothing, isn't it?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{no. that's just you correctly assessing the situation. so stop being so hard on yourself.}
<A>__{he eyes her, then:}
