<L>__{interior dentist next day}
<A>__{an attractive dental technician with an australian accent cleans chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device. she's close, very close. chuck looks up at her. she looks really good. she smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out his tooth.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{you sure you don't want to have the implant done here? we do quite good work.}
<A>__{chuck shakes his head: no. she scrapes behind his front teeth.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter behind these front incisors. a little wider, please.}
<A>__{chuck opens his mouth even further. the technician talks on in the self absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do, that constant babble of human contact which chuck has not heard for four years.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{anyway, so the second prosthetic foot worked better, but he still couldn't drive his new cortina, it being a standard shift, if you follow me.}
<A>__{chuck nods. i follow you.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{but would he hear of me driving him around? not on your bloody life. rinse please.}
<A>__{chuck does. stan bursts into the room.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{chuck! god damn!}
<A>__{chuck struggles out of the chair.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{god damn. god damn. god damn.}
<A>__{they are both almost overcome. stan holds chuck by the shoulders and looks at him.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're alive, you're fucking alive!}
<A>__{chuck laughs, thrilled to see stan.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i beat the odds!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you beat 'em to shit, pal! jesus!}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i still need to floss you.}
<A>__{stan notices the technician.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{this is amber. her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.}
<A>__{he says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the laughter with great effort. instantly there's this connection again between him and stan.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{ex boyfriend.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{and he and chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of their shared unspoken irony.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{uh, there's somebody out here who wants to see you.}
<A>__{chuck stares sharply at him. kelly? stan nods, but there's something he wants to say.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{she thought you were dead. we all did.}
<A>__{that's not all stan wants to say. but chuck is limping out the door.}
