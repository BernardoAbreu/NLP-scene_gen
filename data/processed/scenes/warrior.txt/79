<D>__{gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. i expect a clean fight. obey my commands at all times. defend yourselves at all times. touch gloves, go back, let's do this.}
<A>__{in the crowd, two sections of marines in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for tommy, who returns to his corner. paddy attempts to give him some advice, but tommy is not listening.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{we're about to get the big answer to the big question: is tommy riordan for real? and here we go!}

<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{barbosa's gonna be looking for a take down.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{definitely gonna be looking for a take down.}
<A>__{there will not be a take down. tommy ducks a blow, then levels barbosa with a massive and brutal left hook. the brazilian's head snaps sideways, his mouthpiece goes flying, and he does a face plant on to the canvas. it's over.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{barbosa is down! barbosa has been knocked out! tommy riordan is most definitely for real!}
<A>__{as the crowd erupts and josh rosenthal waves to barbosa's corner to get a medic in there, tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{and now he's walking out of the cage! he's leaving the cage! there goes another rule out the window!}
