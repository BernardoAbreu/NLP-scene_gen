<L>__{interior elementary school principal's office day}
<A>__{kate sits across a desk from principal barnes: female, early 50's, stern, scattered, and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of glasses around her neck.}
<C>__{principal barnes}
<D>__{vice principal davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day so you don't need to worry about that.}

<A>__{kate's not sure how to respond.}
<C>__{principal barnes }
<D>__{having kids wasn't in the cards for me. i came close, but...}
<A>__{principal barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then catches herself and quickly shifts gears.}
<C>__{principal barnes }
<D>__{...i mean, it's like i've got a couple hundred kids here }
<P>__{(forces a laugh)}
<D>__{ but...i don't fool myself. it's not the same.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(considers her reply)}
<D>__{well...it's hard to explain.}
<C>__{principal barnes}
<D>__{of course...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i wouldn't call it a burden, but }
<C>__{principal barnes}
<D>__{it's a responsibility.}

<D>__{like...a lot.}
<A>__{principal barnes gets up and kneels next to kate. she places her hand on kate's belly and closes her eyes.}
<C>__{principal barnes}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{hello in there. can you hear me? you're a tiny miracle. did you know that? a miracle.}
<A>__{principal barnes looks up at kate and smiles with tears in her eyes.}
