<A>__{lighted by dash panel, steve tries to concentrate on seeing the road. he leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get rid of the condensation. from his pov we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay ahead of the rain. beyond them the headlights make a slight dent in the night. in the bg we hear a country station on the radio, but it is bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical storm. steve's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio.}
