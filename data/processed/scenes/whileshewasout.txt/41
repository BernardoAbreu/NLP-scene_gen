<L>__{interior pharmacy evening}
<A>__{della enters a pharmacy. she locates the wrapping paper aisle. she sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety nine cents. she feels the texture of the paper, it's thin and looks gaudy so she puts them all back. instead she selects some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and matching silver ribbon. she then finds some jolly children's wrapping with christmas tree designs and a great big red bow. she browses through the aisles of cards. she sees some cute cards for the twins and then arrives at the "to my darling husband at christmas" section. she opens some of the cards and recoils from the sentiments contained inside. she catches a groomed blonde housewife staring at her and corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a complicit stepford smile.}

<D>__{it's a pity they don't have any "to a bastard at christmas" cards.}
<A>__{the woman looks at della like she's a lunatic. della chuckles to herself. she finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of regular tampax. she gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a tired man and his two kids wait before her on the line. the man tries to remove a snow globe, with a tiny house and christmas tree inside, from the clutches of his young son. the child starts bawling. the man ends up buying the snow globe to placate the child. it's della's turn. the pharmacy sales assistant smiles.}
