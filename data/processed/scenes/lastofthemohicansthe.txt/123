<A>__{and her eyes take it all in. and her affect starts to flatten. a blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head.}
<B>__{hawkeye}
<A>__{locked in combat. he tomahawks one huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand fires killdeer at ...}
<B>__{huron}
<A>__{six feet from uncas and about to shoot him in the back.}
<B>__{hawkeye}
<A>__{free for a moment, spins. he has no idea of direction any more. everything is death in strange tableaux. meanwhile:}

<A>__{hollering}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{cora! alice!}
<A>__{he cuts down a huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. an osage warrior with red scalp lock leaps on the back of munro's horse, reaching over to stab down into munro's neck. the old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in an iron grip. his right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires backward, point blank, blowing the osage off the back of his horse.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{just then munro's mount is shot. his horse rears up, throws munro and falls on him.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{shouting orders over the deafening noise.}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{second rank fire! six paces back! prime! load! third rank! present!}
<A>__{a well oiled, well drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. they're getting cut off. they close ranks automatically as a man drops. they're retreating in perfect order.}
<B>__{huron warrior}
<A>__{about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by magua. closer: magua his eyes drop to what's in front of him. the field goes quiet. over magua's shoulder: munro his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. magua leans in towards him.}

<D>__{grey hair. i will cut your heart from your living chest in front of your eyes. as you die, know that i will put under the knife your children and wipe your seed from this earth forever ...}
<A>__{magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards munro ... mohawk & huron spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. the huron goes down and then the mohawk is shot. the huron who shot him is cut down by a ranger with tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. two mohawks and three rangers fighting back to back. they become an island swamped by huron and ottawa: amidst bodies and ground slippery with blood. as smoke obscures their image. cora & alice in a group of civilian militia. two of the militiamen are shot down. the third engages a fox warrior. cora & alice run. munro's face frozen in agony by shock.}
<B>__{magua}
<A>__{reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into the air. but his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. long shot: magua seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of munro. reverse: hawkeye saw him and fights his way to attack when ...}

<A>__{crazed, crashes through men, knocking hawkeye over ...}
<B>__{chingachgook}
