<L>__{exterior house – tight on derek.}
<A>__{he hovers over big lawrence. gun pointed steadily, he kicks him in the stomach over and over – tongue pressed against teeth. hot air flows from derek’s breath and into the cold.}

<D>__{did you follow me from the courts? answer me, motherfucker!}

<P>__{(anticipating)}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{derek stomps his foot on the back of lawrence’s head – completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb’s corner.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{holy fucking shit! derek! what the hell was that for?! jesus}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{why’d you do that?!}
<A>__{the two look at each other. derek analyzes himself – a gun in one hand and a key of coke in the other. danny checks the man’s condition.}
<C>__{danny}

<C>__{derek}
<D>__{danny?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{derek takes his time answering, drunk with confusion.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{danny runs inside the house. the women scream from the other room. he quickly pans the house for a hiding place. nothing. he spots a planter on the back porch as a helicopter now hovers above. copter lights shine briskly through the house’s windows. obnoxious sirens blare and tires screech outside. danny’s pov. he watches a lone cop take cover behind his door. the officer draws his gun and waits for backup. derek and the cop stare at each other. without instruction, derek drops the gun, turns around, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his knees facing danny. the two brothers share a look of reckoning.}
