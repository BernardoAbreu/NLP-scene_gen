<L>__{exterior cimmerian village day}
<A>__{a small cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley, a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it. round wooden huts surround a stone lined pit, where young cimmerian boys, ages 12 15 stand. pollen drifts through the air, giving it an ethereal haze. at the center of the pit uran, an elder cimmerian warrior speaks.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{a cimmerian warrior is like any other man. a cimmerian warrior feels hunger. he feels cold. like other men he may lie and cheat.}
<P>__{(stares the boys down)}
<D>__{but when a cimmerian warrior hungers, he hungers only for the blood of his enemy. when he feels cold, it is the cold steel of his sword. when he lies, he lies in wait for his enemy. and when he cheats, he cheats death itself!}
<A>__{uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good two heads smaller than the rest. he is no more than eight, but his face is as stoic, driven.}
<C>__{uran }
<D>__{conan! you are too young to be here. withdraw.}
<A>__{conan, determined, doesn't move an inch. the largest teen menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.}
<C>__{largest teen}
<D>__{he said leave, motherless whelp.}
<A>__{the hulking teen goes to shove conan, but conan pulls his arm towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the teen in the throat. the large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for air. a smattering of laughs erupt from the boys, quickly silenced by uran's stare. uran hands out river stones to each boy, ending with conan. the boys know what to do: they put the large stones in their mouths.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{in the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword. the one who claims it, with stone still in his mouth, will have earned the right to train with the warriors.}
<A>__{the boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.}
<C>__{uran }
<D>__{well? what are you waiting for?!}
<A>__{and off they run. they knock each other down, punching the other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel their stones. one or two succeed. most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high into the mountains. but a few head right for the sheer cliff face. conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.}
<B>__{cliff face}
<A>__{and when the cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold. they find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock face as though it were a ladder. the hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as conan, trying to knock him off. conan swings with one hand and finds another path. in moments he is ahead.}
