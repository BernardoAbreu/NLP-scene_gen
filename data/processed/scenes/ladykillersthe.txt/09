<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{oh, he's up the tree again. your gonna have to shimmy on up.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i am so terribly sorry, madam. but won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{huh? no, he won't come down less you fetch him. he'd set there til gabriel blows his horn if someone didn't shimmy up. up with you now!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well then couldn't we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements, or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in hong kong but now produced in the other so called "little tigers"...}

<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...of the pacific rim? the point bein', do we have to actually ascend the tree }

<D>__{no need to call the authorities. i did this often as a youth why, i was a positive lemur... here, kitty...}
<A>__{the cat backs away down a branch, arching its back and hissing.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{don't upset him, now!}
<A>__{dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i wouldn't dream of it... harmless little felix domesticus... come to g.h...}
<A>__{the branch breaks, hinging down to slam dorr face first into the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the ground.}
