<L>__{exterior podacter's balcony cont}
<A>__{ace examines the area. einhorn is in hot pursuit.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{oh, so, you don't think this in an obvious suicide, mr. pet detective?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't say that. lord knows, there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory, except of course that spot of blood on the balcony.}
<A>__{on the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood. einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. they look down.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{may i tell you what i think happened? alrighty then!}
<A>__{ace moves as he talks.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{roger podacter went out after work. he had a few drinks, and he came home. but he wasn't alone. someone was with him in this apartment. there was a struggle, and then roger podacter was thrown over that balcony. roger podacter didn't commit suicide. he was murdered.}
<A>__{a beat as everyone considers this.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{well, that's a very entertaining story, but real detectives have to worry about that little thing lawyers call evidence.}
<A>__{ace picks up a lottery ticket on podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{let's take a trip to clue corner, shall we? can anyone tell me why a man buys a lottery ticket on the day he is going to commit suicide? or why the family pet, suffering from acute canine trauma, clawed at the bedroom door until his paws bled? how about the blood on the railing? i will bet if we put our thinking caps on we'll see that it was the result of the struggle that took place inside this apartment while mr. podacter was still alive!}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{next time you don't have a clue come on back to clue corner! boop!}
<A>__{everyone looks to einhorn.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{not a bad try for a pet detective, but not near conclusive enough for us real investigators.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{first, people buy lottery tickets everyday. it's a habit. it doesn't prove a thing. second, the dog wasn't suffering from canine trauma, he was suffering from bladder trauma. sergeant neilson found a piss stain as big as lake huron near the bed. and third, the blood on the railing. simple. he doesn't jump far enough and whacks his head. a fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp, with traces of a white chalky substance. i.e. plaster from the balcony.}
<A>__{einhorn shows ace the paramedics report. everyone is impressed with einhorn.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{so much for your murder, ventura.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{uh oh, i think i heard a toilet flush. maybe someone lost their turtle?}
<A>__{everyone has a laugh. ace looks beaten.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{well, maybe i'm just a little out of my league, here. einhorn…}
<A>__{ace holds out his hand, einhorn shakes it.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{…good work.}
<A>__{ace and melissa head for the door.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{oh, there is just one more thing, lieutenant.}
<P>__{(re: the neighbor)}
<D>__{this man is roger podacter's neighbor. he lives across the hall. he said he heard a scream, is that right, sir?}
<A>__{the neighbor nods. ace turns to the apartment manager.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{and you said you had to open the balcony door when you keyed into the room?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you're certain you had to open this door?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{what's the point, ventura?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{only this… aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww…}
<A>__{ace sustains an incredible pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them. when the door is closed nothing can be heard.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(tapping the door)}
<D>__{this is double paned, sound proofed glass. there's no way this neighbor could have heard podacter scream on the way down with this door shut. the scream he heard came from inside this apartment, before podacter was thrown over the railing! and the muderer closed the door before he left!}
<P>__{(celebrates insanely)}
<D>__{yes! yesss! i have exorcised the demons!}
<P>__{(a la poltergeist)}
<D>__{this house is clear.}
