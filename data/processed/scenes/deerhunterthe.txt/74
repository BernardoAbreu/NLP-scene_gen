<A>__{there are five of them, coming in low under the tops of nearby trees.}
<L>__{exterior grass huts the villagers day}
<A>__{the villagers stand motionless, staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror. they turn. they start to run. and then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.}
<L>__{exterior grass huts after napalm attack day}
<A>__{merle stands alone with his b.a.r. surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke. there is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames. merle's clothes are burning. flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet. in front of merle the soldiers and the villagers lie in two charred heaps. the babies lie between them. both are motionless now, like two roasted stones. an american lieutenant steps out from behind one of the burning huts. merle and the lieutenant spin on each other and then the lieutenant lowers his carbine.}

<A>__{more americans appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line. among them are nick and sal.}

<D>__{move it out, girls! move it out!}
<A>__{the lieutenant heads down the line. nick stares at merle.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merle?... jesus, merle!}
<A>__{merle turns and looks at nick. there is no recognition. he seems to be looking right through him. sal comes up behind nick.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{hey...! hey, merle!}
<A>__{a shot rings out. the lieutenant goes down and suddenly the whole line of americans is caught in a murderous cross fire. grenades rain out of the trees. merle, nick and sal dive for cover. out of the smoke v.c. soldiers begin to appear, more and more of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.}
