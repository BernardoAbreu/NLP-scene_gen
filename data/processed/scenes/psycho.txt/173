<A>__{lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out of norman's room. she has left the light on. she pauses in the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.}

<A>__{sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. a candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking as if just dropped. over shot comes the sound of norman's footsteps and camera turns in time to catch a brief glimpse of him going out into the office, almost at a run.}
