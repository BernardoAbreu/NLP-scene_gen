<L>__{interior video store day}
<A>__{ed arrives at work. the store is already open. (ed usually gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing.) customers are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera. some know what it's about some don't. the clerks are aware of what's going on. they all signed releases. ed's boss greets him stiffly. clearly he's trying to get face time on camera.}

<D>__{welcome to work, ed.}
<A>__{he shakes ed's hand and smiles at the camera. he waves a little. the broom guy crosses, staring transfixed at the camera. he blocks ed and lou. he freezes, then panics. he tries to get out of the way and trips over his broom. he tumbles face first into the camera lens, hurting himself. angle on ed, observing.}
