<A>__{the cop looms over bernie and natalie. cocks his pistol. lowers the gun to the back of bernie's head. they appear oblivious to it. they're already in another place. sunning themselves in the bahamas. the cop squeezes back the trigger.}
<B>__{on bernie and natalie}
<A>__{still looking at each other. suddenly the piercing shriek of screeching tires... followed by a reverberating, bone crunching wham! and a gunshot. bernie and natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not quite sure what's just transpired. only that they're still breathing. they look around, startled to see the tail lights of a pick up truck about ten yards away. the cop, their would be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels. all this in the blink of an eye. natalie clutches bernie's arm. suppresses a hysterical, shock induced giggle. bernie just looks dumbfounded. he staggers to his feet, rushes over to the pick up truck. the driver's head is protruding through the shattered windshield. death glazed eyes. bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure. shakes his head. we see a dozen coors empties on the seat and floor of the truck. natalie checks the cop. likewise. bernie comes over. they regard each other breathlessly.}

<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{don't give it a name, bernie. it scares me. all i know is, you're still running hot and that's a good thing. but we're only winners if we keep going. no looking back.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{lady luck, natalie. i'm calling it. lady luck. and we got it as long as we're together. they can't touch us now.}
<A>__{he kisses her furiously. then drags her over to his car. they climb in. drive off.}
