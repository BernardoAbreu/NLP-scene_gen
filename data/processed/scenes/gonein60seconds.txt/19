<A>__{a barmaid sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{there you go }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{thanks, donna }
<A>__{she leaves... atley is staring at him... memphis shrugs...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{it's been a long time, memphis }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{six years ...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{six years. shit. time flies, don't it? six years ago we were fartin' through armani and pissin' cristal. now look at us ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{tell me about kip }
<A>__{atley takes a sip of his beer,...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{he took a job. and he fumbled it. now he's jammed up. jammed up bad...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{what kind of job... ?}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{a boost. a big boost ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{a boost? what's kip doing on a boost?}
<A>__{atley frowns ... looks at him...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{you're shittin', right?}
<A>__{clearly memphis is not ...}
<C>__{atley jackson }
<D>__{kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. he's been working a low rent ring for two years now. you don't talk to your ma?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{it seems she neglected to mention it}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{maybe she don't know. although i don't see how that could be. maybe she didn't want to upset you }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, atley...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{the point is: kip's been living the life. only he's a wild child. crazy. makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. but he fungold this one so bad, folks around l.b. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.}
<A>__{memphis takes a beat ... sips at his brew ... then:}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{who was the job for?}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{who do you think?}
<A>__{memphis waits ... in no mood for guessing games ...}
<C>__{atley jackson }
<D>__{calitri, man. raymond "the carpenter" calitri ... your favorite and mine ...}
<A>__{which means nothing to us ... though the look on memphis, face speaks volumes ...}
<C>__{atley jackson }
<D>__{i just thought you should know, man. i kind of had a feeling you didn't. but i should tell you: i'm working for him now the carpenter so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... like i said: i just thought ... i owed you ... and that it was the right thing to do ...}
<A>__{memphis nods ... his face clenched in despair. we fade to black: , as a super on screen reads: part 1: stolen moments we pre lap j. geils band's "hard drivin' man" and cut to: three plates of bacon, eggs and hash browns placed on the service deck by a short order cook...}
