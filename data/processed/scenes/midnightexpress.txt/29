<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{bell goes up for another ball close to the net and really smashes it with all his might, and: ball bangs right into the eye of a turk who flails his arms and screams with pain, very theatrical.}
<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the same turk now swaggers around the courtyard, wearing sunglasses so no one will see his black eye.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{...to the turks all foreigners are "ayip" unclean, dirty. we don't shave our under arms or around our crotch...}
<A>__{bell across the pointyard grins at him and points him out to billy, and erich.}
<C>__{billy voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{even the yoga i sometimes do is "ayip" too suggestive...}
<A>__{the turk scowls back at bell, huddles menacingly with another turk.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{and you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. you know why? because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper. and yet they hate pigs. there are no pigs in turkey. they're considered dirty...}
<A>__{bell, smirking at the turk, turns and walks away.}
<C>__{billy voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{so is homosexuality. that's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get. there are about a thousand things that are "ayip". but they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. for instance...}
<A>__{suddenly a cry off and: the turk runs up, pulling a sharp shiv from his pants, and using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly stabs bell in the ass and backs of his thighs. one, two, three, four, five quick stabs, like a cook hammering veal. in spite of its violence, the action seems like slapstick. bell tumbles to the ground, crying out. the turk stashes the shiv and disappears among his friends, his honor restored. billy and erich run over to help bell who is obviously more in pain than in danger.}
<C>__{billy voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{...you can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. so everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass. that's what they call 'turkish revenge'. there's also a lot of "baksheesh" that's a favorite turkish word for bribery...}
<A>__{long shot hamidou and aslan the young fat turkish gangster pointed out previously by erich, are taking tea together in the first story kogus alone except for ziatr and hamidou's two fat sons, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in little suits listening politely as hamidou gestures to them, in couched terms. the voices are distant and, after a few beats, under billy's voice:}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{unfortunately my youngest son arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days}
<C>__{aslan}
<P>__{(patting arief on the head)}
<D>__{poor kid... you know i have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a... reasonable price.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<P>__{(protesting with}
<D>__{his hands, shaking his head)) oh, no...it's out of the question...wouldn't want to ask your friend...}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{yes. please! as a favour... i insist}
<A>__{they go on, each protesting.}
<C>__{billy voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons. aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist. they bullshit for half an hour and hamidou finally accepts the "baksheesh" in return...}
<A>__{a burlap bag comes flying over the wall of the courtyard late at night. then another comes over, lands in the yard. one is around.}
<C>__{billy voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to aslan, who re sells it through his runners. people like ziat. but one night, it backfired...}
<A>__{a third bag comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips right open. hundreds of yellow pills spill out.}
