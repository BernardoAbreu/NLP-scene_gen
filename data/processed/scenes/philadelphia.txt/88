<D>__{anywhere from two weeks, to several months.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{any women on board?}
<A>__{kenton glances at the marine juror.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{not when i was in the navy.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god given, hormonal instincts ... anything going on?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{going on... like...?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{like... two sailors playing hide the salami.}
<A>__{andrew covers his face with his hands.}
<C>__{belinda}

<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you haven't ruled on my objection, your honor.}
<A>__{kenton seems eager to tell his story. joe stands with crossed arms, waiting.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{let's continue.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to kenton)}
<D>__{you had one guy "like that?"}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{yeah. but we took care of him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{we stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.}
<A>__{laughter and some applause from some spectators, and some jurors. activists boo and hiss. the judge pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you taught him a lesson.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{yes, we did.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{like firing andrew beckett taught him a lesson?}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will withdraw.}
<P>__{(moving on quickly)}
<D>__{you were aware, when you worked with maria torres, that she had aids, correct?}
<C>__{kenton}
<A>__{she didn't try to conceal it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{i know the difference. that doesn't mean i'm always able to recognize the difference.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but didn't you avoid contact with ms. torres, after you found out she had aids? she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{i felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.}
