<A>__{a shot of daddy and buddy in a rose garden below the windows of the house. it is hawkshaw the detective and his unwilling assistant. daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{see that, son? now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. someone has been walking here.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{well, it's not very plain.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{that is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him understand?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{but how would you find him?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well. well, what i mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. but look this, brother, it is even more interesting. look at this mark here, and that mark over there. now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, i don't know.}
<P>__{(trying to sound like a}
<D>__{fellow detective, but doesn't want rose to get}
<P>__{caught)}
<D>__{no, i don't know, daddy, i think the rain has obscured it.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{true, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.}
