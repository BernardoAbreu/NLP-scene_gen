<B>__{a phone rings...}
<A>__{lorenz enters, shuts the door and removes his mask. he lets a few rings pass, before answering.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<P>__{(into voice modulator)}
<D>__{detective conners?}
<L>__{intercut with: exterior american national bank day}
<A>__{conners and company gather outside of the police tech van. dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes. dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{who am i speaking with?}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{for now... you can call me lorenz.}
<A>__{dekker writes, "lorenz."}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{okay, lorenz, how are we doing in there? can we get you anything? food, medical supplies. we heard an explosion.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{everyone who matters is fine. of course, i would've preferred not having the authorities involved at all. we weren't planning to be here this long. but, since seattle's finest needs a presence on the scene, i'm glad it's you.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{my fame proceeds me.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{don't be flattered. i needed someone who's been through the experience before. hopefully this time it will go better for all involved. i plan on living a full, long and rich life. i didn't, however, expect them to find you so quickly. i thought you were suspended.}
<A>__{dekker writes, "in the know," on his pad.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{i was, but i'm back. you're information's old.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{you never get what you pay for.}
<P>__{(back to business)}
<D>__{you want to know about the hostages? how many and are they okay?}
<A>__{dekker scribbles, "pro".}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{approximately forty, they're fine, considering. all except one. we had a situation.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{someone's dead?}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{theory... put to practice isn't always perfect. can't expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may... randomly decide to revolt. chaos... has some order to it.}
<P>__{(conners drifts in thought)}
<D>__{detective? are you still with me?}
<A>__{teddy snaps her fingers. that gets conners attention. there's a new intensity to his demeanor.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{what else will i be looking for?}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{demands... probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{safe to say.}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{stay by the phone. i will contact you shortly.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{lorenz...}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{don't worry, i have no plans until sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. it's going to be a long one.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{wait, we're talking here...}
<C>__{lorenz}
<D>__{patience, detective. we don't want another pearl street bridge, do we?}
<A>__{conners's thrown by the mention of pearl street bridge. lorenz abruptly hangs up.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{he's off.}
