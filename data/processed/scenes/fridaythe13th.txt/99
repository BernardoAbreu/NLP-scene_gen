<A>__{the camera, shooting from the prowler's pov, moves to a place alongside alice's cabin. there is underbrush about two feet tall and all around that area. the prowler stops, leans down and reaches into frame with a gloved hand. the gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a burlap bag which has been secreted there. the hand lifts the bag, which has something in it that moves. the camera moves around to the side of the cabin right below the window. the window is open, making entry quite simple. the prowler's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in and haul out quickly a medium sized snake. one hand has the animal firmly behind the jaws. the hand takes the snake and puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white coverlet. it slithers across the bed. the prowler's hand closes the window. the camera moves towards one of the sheds.}
