<D>__{as first officer i should be the one beaming down...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{normally, i would agree. but in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. you're many things, number one, but you're not much of an historian.}

<C>__{riker}
<D>__{good luck, sir.}
<C>__{picard}
