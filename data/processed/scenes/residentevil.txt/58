<A>__{wesker looks around. there are three doorways...open wide with only darkness beyond. wesker runs around closing them.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{watch these entrances, guys.}
<A>__{fox and marini take up posts. brad lowers himself gingerly. he drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his bloody leg.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{aaaah ! shit.}
<A>__{he topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.}
<C>__{vickers }
<D>__{i'm alright. i'm alright.}
<A>__{he limps over and attacks the computer keys. grrrrraaaaawwwwwllll! another distant snarl.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{hold tight. it doesn't sound like it's on this level.}
<C>__{vickers}
<P>__{(at the computer) shit. i'm locked}
<D>__{out. any clues for a password?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{try... umbrella.}
<A>__{brad types rapidly, nervously. flubs. types again.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{nothing. wait. i'm into... no. no data. just some kind of video feed. time coded. yesterday. it's a play back. (watching the screen) holy shit!}
<A>__{we hear it before we see it. the sound of absolute panic. people shouting! screaming! thuds and crashes! glass breaking! then a woman's voice .}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{please...please.. .if anyone is receiving this...}
<A>__{brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the others to see. the woman is an oriental. she's standing in the foreground, as marcus was in the opening video. behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white coated figures... running... firing guns.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{the situation is completely. out of control. we...}
<B>__{w}
<A>__{ham ! the woman is pushed out of the way by a man who is trying to protect her from... ...something that blurs past the lens, like a pendulum, from above. in the next instant... splat... the lens is coated with blood! as it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same man. his head is out of frame at the top of the screen. the thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is dangling, his arms witching. his back has three gouges in it, long and so deep that they might have been made by piece of heavy machinery. we only see this for an instant... before the man is lifted, straight up, with amazing speed. wesker clicks off the monitor. the other men instinctively look up above their heads.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{maybe the ceiling's not such a safe place, after all.}
<A>__{crash! the door behind fox bursts open. before he has time to react a zombie is on him, biting his cheek, neck, shoulder. the two figures fall to the floor, grappling. wesker can't get a clean shot.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{scram! scram!}
<A>__{marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping brad up ahead of him. two more zombies lurch in through the open doorway. wesker shoots them, but he sees more... can't tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the darkness beyond. wesker focuses on fox, who is still being mauled, bitten. fox screams. wesker still has no safe shot. brad is yanked up into ceiling by sullivan and aiken. chris leans out of the opening, reaching for marini. wesker kicks the mauling zombie in the head. it takes three hard boots to attract the thing's attention. when it finally looks up at him, wesker blows out its skull. fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, bleeding profusely from a half dozen bites. wesker stoops down, trying to roll him over, lift him up. fox resists. he's gone insane. chris pulls marini up to safety. barry leans down through the opening.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{haul ass, boss!}
<A>__{the zombies are heading for wesker. there are three of them. barry shoots at the one in front. misses. his second shot hits the thing's brain. wesker again tries to hoist fox who, this time rolls over on his own. he has drawn his pistol. before wesker can stop him, he eats the barrel and blows out the back of his head. one zombie is dangerously close. barry fires two more rounds. no head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though not dead, falls...directly toward wesker. the colonel rolls on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear. he uses his own pistol to blast the zombie. he scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps up. the third zombie grabs his legs. from above, barry risks a dangerous shot. blam! wesker hears the bullet whizzz past his head like a mosquito. the zombie is hit in the skull. it drops. there are more of them coming out of the darkness. barry takes hold of wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...}
