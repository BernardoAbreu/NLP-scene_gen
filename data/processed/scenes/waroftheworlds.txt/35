<L>__{interior harland's house basement dusk continuous}
<A>__{harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks at ray and rachel. his face, half lit looks medieval with the clothes he wears. harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where ray and rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(to rachel) you all right?}
<A>__{rachel does not respond most likely due to shock.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(to ray) and what about you?}
<A>__{ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. he is still heard muttering "robbie" very quietly. harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about on the floor. the army platoon has gone far enough over the hill that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(while harland moves the wheel barrel) (to rachel) there you go. is that comfortable?}
<D>__{i need you to close your eyes now, okay? you need some sleep.}
<A>__{rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{ray already knows what she is going to ask.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he's gonna meet us. hey, robbie's gonna meet us, rach, in boston, at your grandma's.}
<A>__{harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(about ready to cry) what do you think}
<D>__{mom's doing right this minute?}
<A>__{harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation. he begins sharpening a shovel with a file.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mom? she's in boston. waiting. and i know she's not sleeping 'cause she is so worried about you. (trying to comfort her) ... and she's in grandma's kitchen, and she's making that awful tea that she makes. and they're all just... ... ...there all just counting the minutes until they see you again.}
<A>__{rachel is crying because she misses robbie and her mom. ray sees the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to investigate what it is.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(picking up the ribbon) what is this?}
<D>__{what... what is this?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i won.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you won?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the walk, trot, and canter. third place.}
<A>__{she begins to feel dreary...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{sing me "lullaby and goodnight"?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(shakes his head in displeasure because}
<D>__{he can't think of it) i don't remember that one.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{sing me "hushabye mountain"?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sorry rach, i don't know that one either.}
<A>__{rachel turns over (her back to ray) because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. ray thinks for a moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(begins to sing) i'm not bragging, baby.}
<D>__{so don't put me down. because i've got the fastest set of wheels in the town. something comes up to me that don't even try....}
<A>__{rachel turns back over as ray continues singing...}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(continues singing) ... if i had a set}
<D>__{of wings, man, i know she could fly. she's my little deuce coupe. you don't know what i've got... just my little deuce coupe. (now whispering) you don't know what i've got....}
<A>__{rachel has fallen asleep. ray kisses her on the forehead. harland taps two glasses together and says...}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{peach schnapps.}
<A>__{ray gets up and begins walking towards him.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{disgusting, i know it. i found a whole case of this shit.}
<A>__{harland hands ray a glass as they both sit down.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{silence falls over for a period.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your son.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we got separated... he's gonna meet us in umm... in boston.}
<A>__{ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) did you loose anybody?}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{all of them.}
<A>__{another pause.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(introduces himself) harland ogilvy.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(introduces himself) ray ferrier.}
<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{i got water... food.... enough for weeks. you're welcome to stay, both of yous.}
<A>__{ray gets up from the conversation.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm gonna get some sleep.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(speaks loud enough to get ray to pause)}
<D>__{those machines, those tripods they got... they buried them... right under our feet. since before there were even people here. they've been planning this for a million years. we're beat to shit.}
<A>__{ray looks at harland sternly because he is afraid rachel may hear what he may say nexterior}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{please, my daughter.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{think about it. ... they defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days. walked right over us. .... and these are only the first, they'll keep coming. this is not a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots. this is an extermination.}
<A>__{ray walks over to where rachel is sleeping.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(feeling he's not grasping the reality)}
<D>__{are you afraid?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{of course i am.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(going on) i been around death plenty.}
<D>__{drive an ambulance in the city. well, drove and ambulance in the city. that's all over now, huh? .... you know the people who make it ray? the ones that don't flatline before the hospital? it's the ones who keep their eyes open, keep looking at you, keep thinking. .... there the ones who survive... .... we can' t loose our heads ray. .... running, that's what'll kill you. ...... i'm dead set on livin'.}
<A>__{he pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{hah. dead set on living.}
<A>__{harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first started.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{thank you for taking us in.}
<A>__{ray lies down next to rachel as harland finishes...}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{we're not going to be exterminated.}
<A>__{the ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. ray gets back up just as boom!! a small piece of the corner of the basement collapses from all the vibration.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(with shotgun at side) it's okay! come}
<D>__{on, i wanna show you something!}
<A>__{they both are waling towards a window.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{we're gonna fight them ray. they gotta have a weakness. come on, take a look.}
<A>__{ray and harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{somehow they killed a few of these things in osaka. that's what i heard. you telling me the japanese can figure it out but we can't?}
<A>__{ray goes over to rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere else.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{we can do it. we can get 'em. we can figure it out.}
<A>__{ray puts the now wide awake rachel in a chair.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stay right there!}
<A>__{ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground almost as if they are tilling up the soil. he now understands that robots do this on a regular basis.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i have a daughter! why did you bring us here?}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{to fight 'em together, ray. .... now we'll be the ones coming up from underground. when the time is right, we'll take 'em by supries, the way they took us. we'll take 'em by surprise.}
<A>__{ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying with an insane man.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{we're right under their feet, ray. right here, under their feet.}
