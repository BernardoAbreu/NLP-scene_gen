<L>__{interior staircase outside old salieri's salon night 1823}
<A>__{total darkness. we hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress. it is old salieri. he uses a mixture of english and occasionally italian.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! mozart. forgive me! forgive your assassin! mozart!}
<A>__{a faint light illuminates the screen. flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. we are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing. up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by salieri's valet. by his side is salieri's cook, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. both men are desperately worried: the valet is thin and middle aged; the cook, plump and italian. it is very cold. they wear shawls over their night dresses and clogs on their feet. they wheeze as they climb. the candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. a cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door. the valet tries the handle. it is locked. behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{show some mercy! i beg you. i beg you! show mercy to a guilty man!}
<A>__{the valet knocks gently on the door. the voice stops.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{open the door, signore! please! be good now! we've brought you something special. something you're going to love.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{signore salieri! open the door. come now. be good!}
<A>__{the voice of old salieri continues again, further off now, and louder. we hear a noise as if a window is being opened.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! i confess it! listen! i confess!}
<A>__{the two servants look at each other in alarm. then the valet hands the candlestick to the cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.}
