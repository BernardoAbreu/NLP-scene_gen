<A>__{sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat to shit old air boat, rips through the florida swamp land. he glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall grass which whips at the hull of his boat. bits and pieces of debris fly through the air. sam smiles, swinging the boat through a series of wide, sliding turns. suddenly he spots something. he throttles down gliding into a shallow pool where... a huge alligator, aware it has been found out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling out of sight}

<A>__{sam sits for a moment in the silence. he pulls a pair of binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.}

<A>__{all we see is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings shimmering in the last long light of afternoon. sam watches for some time. at last he lowers the binoculars, revs up his engine and leaves. angle on sam's boat as it moves away, as seen from water level where... the old gator has risen once more just the eyes a cold primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky waters of the swamp.}
