<L>__{interior truman's car. dusk.}
<A>__{truman and meryl are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the new jersey turnpike. we observe the oldsmobile on a television lens from the pov of a tail light on the car ahead.}

<P>__{(a manic edge to his voice)}
<D>__{so much traffic, this time of day. does that strike you as peculiar?}
<A>__{on the side of the road, two motorists, are arguing over a minor collision.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(sneering at the sight of the motorists)}
