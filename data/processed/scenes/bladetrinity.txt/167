<A>__{caulder's land cruiser glides through the streets.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{where are you taking us?}
<C>__{caulder}
<D>__{another safehouse.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{we told you, blade. we operate in sleeper cells. when one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack.}
<L>__{exterior deep six aquarium stock night}
<A>__{caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.}
<L>__{interior deep six aquarium stock night}
<A>__{caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door. he leads blade and abigail through the darkened aisles. there are fish tanks on either side, aerators bubbling, aquatic animals of every kind swimming about.}
<B>__{in the back}
<A>__{is another arsenal lab area. this one is smaller than the nightstalkers' main headquarters. caulder moves to a computer, calls up a file. a dialogue box for a media player opens. caulder activates a video file.}
<C>__{caulder}
<D>__{sommerfield left a video message for you.}
<B>__{on the monitor}
<A>__{the video plays. we see sommerfield's face on the screen. she looks grave, as if she might have been crying.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<P>__{(on video)}
<D>__{if you're watching this, i'm already dead. if zoe's still alive, i want you to promise you'll take care of her. i've been reading her the oz books every night. we just started the emerald city of oz, the one with the nome king }
<A>__{her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{i think i've managed to cultivate a workable strain of the daystar virus. as a precaution, i transmitted the genetic sequence to caulder, in case our main stock was destroyed. in order for it to achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to interfuse it with drake's blood. if it works, any vampires in the immediate vicinity should die almost instantly. after that, it should take only a few weeks for the virus to spread throughout the rest of the world.}
<A>__{zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{there's one other thing, blade. you need to know that there's a chance the virus could destroy you too. because you're a hybrid, i'm not sure whether your immune system will be able tolerate it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we didn't have enough time to properly test it.}
<A>__{the video cuts to static. abigail turns off the monitor, looking to blade. god only knows what he's thinking.}
<C>__{caulder}
<D>__{take a look at the plague arrow.}
<A>__{caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it open. inside, resting on a bed of form fitting foam, is a glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake like contraption. it looks like the head of a high tech harpoon.}
<C>__{caulder}
<D>__{i only had time to fabricate a small batch of daystar. i outfitted it with a compressed gas projectile, so you should be able to fire it from one of the fourbarrel rifles or a bow.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just make sure the shot counts, cause we don't have enough for a second try.}
<B>__{a series of dissolves}
<A>__{abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom mp3 playlist. we watch as she hi lights songs with her mouse, moves them over to her portable device with a few clicks. abigail unhooks her mp3 device, slips her earbud headphones into her ears. the sounds of fluke's track atom bomb fade up, gradually shifting from tinny source music to soundtrack.}
<B>__{more dissolves}
<A>__{blade and abigail suit up, arming themselves. we see: blade loading rounds into his pistols. abigail selecting arrows, checking the range dials. blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers. abigail working with caulder, affixing the plague capsule to one of her arrowheads. blade polishes his sword. finished, he sights down the length of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back scabbard with a flourish.}
