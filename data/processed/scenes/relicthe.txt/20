<L>__{interior corridors stairwell museum day}
<A>__{margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower. she half runs down an elegant, edwardian fifth floor corridor, her footsteps lost in the thick carpet. at the very end is a heavy oak door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply "dr. frock".}
<L>__{interior frock's office day}
<A>__{margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to the modernity of her own. two large bow windows look out over the park. upholstered victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint carpets featuring large red roses. plant specimens and drawings of flora and fauna line the walls. cardboard boxes cover the floor. seated in a wheelchair is a white haired man in a tweed jacket and a loud floral tie. glasses slip down his nose. this is dr. frock, and he's in the middle of packing. he looks up, smiles apologetically.}
<C>__{dr. frock}
<D>__{hello, margo. sorry about the mess.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{is it true? greg said you'd been fired.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{yes. bit of a shock. but as cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. and since i've been here since the mesozoic era }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{now margo, don't overreact. cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. my leaving makes perfect sense. this isn't exactly early retirement. i've overstayed the party a bit.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{we can't do without you. you're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. you're practically an institution around here.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{that, apparently, is the problem. i'm yesterday's news. who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.}
<A>__{frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and margo moves to his side. she pulls frock's books back out of the box, returns them to his desk.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{"phyletic transformation and the tertiary fern spike" is not going anywhere. i will talk to cuthbert and put a stop to this right now.}
<A>__{she starts for the door and frock wheels into her path. now for the first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding... the deep pain in his eyes.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{please. don't humiliate me further.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{let me help. i can take care of everything.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{no, margo. this is one problem you can't solve. you have to stay out of it. the fact is, i want to retire.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how can you say that? you know it's not true.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{yes it is. i'm tired and i'm no longer needed }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{with all due respect, dear, that's bull. you dance rings around me with your new technology. you've left me in the dust.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(stubbornly loyal)}
<D>__{your work is highly relevant. what about your display on primitive pharmacology? cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art.}
<A>__{frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says the discussion is over.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{come on. i will walk you back to the elevator.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm not giving up.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{you must.}
