<A>__{billy is led down a corridor by hamidou into: a visiting room cabins are lined up like narrow wooden phone booths.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{kabin on yedi}
<A>__{billy plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes the door, sits in the chair. no one is there. he waits indifferent to any sense of time. dirty two glass panes separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the panes. an erratic microphone is the method of communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the voice. hamidou opens a small peep hole in the cabin door, looks in unseen as: tee visitor door opens and susan tentatively walks in holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for her to react, and then her face shows the shock. billy stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well. reality, the outside world all at once. his mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp it.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{oh my god...!}
<B>__{susan}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{billy, what have they done to you...my god!}
<A>__{the microphone makes her voice jarring, gagged. she looks silently. no sobbing, no big sad looks. just shock. shock of recognition, shock of time gone by. billy looking at her, his eyes moving down to: billy p.o.v. susan, her neck, her breasts straining against the thin shirt. susan fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and distinct; not sure she is communicating.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...billy, your family is fine. senator buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the senate. newsday has written several big articles about you. they've called you a pawn in the poppy game between nixon and the turks. the letters are coming in, billy. people care....}
<A>__{stops, shakes her head. it sounds all wrong in this contexterior billy is still staring at her breasts. he hasn't seen a woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes into his eyes he moves suddenly pressing up against the glass, rabid. and in turkish:}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(in turkish)}
<D>__{take it off. take it off!}
<P>__{(then remembering the english)}
<D>__{take it off. take it off!}
<A>__{his voice is savage, demanding. susan understands, startled. looks around.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{billy you'll just make yourself crazy.}
<B>__{billy}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{take it off! take it off!}
<P>__{(suddenly in a very soft voice)}
<D>__{...s'il vous plait?...}
<A>__{a strange look in his eye. susan slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt. hamidou looks on silently, does nothing. billy follows every movement with wild eyed lust. susan leans up close to the window. with both hands on the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart. billy going wild! against the window. his hand down in his pyjamas. her breasts spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. they hang full and loose. full screen billy's eyes full screen. billy beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly. susan is shattered, scared of billy's sanity.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh billy, billy, i wish i could make it better for you. please don't... don't...}
<A>__{tears. fear. billy tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants, slumps against the window. susan realizes he has come, surprised. billy looks at her. furtive, animal shame. and suddenly he starts to cry. a flood of feelings locked up too long come pouring out. he murmurs some words, turkish sounds sputtering out in his throat, then:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{s.... susan?}
<A>__{softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak. susan yearning. tears sprinkling her eyes.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, billy?}
<A>__{billy straining, not out of physical weakness but an emotional one. sputters, eyes closed.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{...i love you....}
<A>__{it sounds pathetic, lost. susan is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through the window.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh billy... billy! don't give up. please don't give up. you'll get out. i know you will!}
<A>__{remembers something. grabs the photo album with all her strength, holding it up for him to see through the glass.then remembering herself, looks around the room to make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{billy, your father gave me this for you. there's pictures of your mom and dad...rob...peg...}
<A>__{billy looks at it listlessly. his p.v.o susan holding the album open to pictures of his mother and father in front of the house, rob on a bicycle, peg in her cheer leading outfit.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and there's pictures in the back of your old mr. franklin. remember him... from the bank?}
<A>__{a certain tone slips into her voice.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he's over in greece now. he bought a ticket.}
<A>__{billy looks from the album to susan. possibly there is a gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very fainterior an attendant bangs on susan's door, off.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{visiting is over.}
<A>__{susan quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden weapon.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i will give it to them for you.}
<A>__{she buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on billy.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you were right billy don't count on them, you hear, don't count on anybody but yourself!}
<A>__{the attendant now swings open her door, annoyed.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to the bars, hard and practical.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{if you stay you'll die billy! get out of here. get to greece, you hear me?...billy?}
<A>__{pause. silence. she closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't think she has reached him. she turns to go, resigned. billy looking at her. behind him hamidou opens the door. a calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with billy towards a brief glimpse of susan looking back, the album under her arm. the door closes.}
