<L>__{interior the countess' office day}
<A>__{the countess is in a snit.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{sissy, don't play dumb with me! you're a good model but a shitty actress. the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. you know perfectly well they are. last seen in nebraska. didn't make it to canada. siwash lake is between nebraska and canada. the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake. and who else but jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? how much do you know about it? have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i don't know anything about it.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{sissy. you're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. those stinking sluts are going to suffer...}
<A>__{sissy strikes the countess with her right thumb with astonishing force. immediately the thumb strikes again, this time shattering the countess's monocle against his eye.}
<C>__{the countess}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{shit o dear.}
<A>__{his dentures fall onto the shag rug. the left thumb strikes. sissy is swinging her thumbs like ballbats socking flaming homers over the left field fence. the countess is out on his feet. his eyes are closed. his legs wobble. he does a pathetic dance, like a drunken old fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl. he topples forward and meets sissy's onrushing thumb of thunder which straightens him up, sends him over backward. motionless, he lies on the floor, a crimson part in his thinning hair, a bright ooze at each nostril.}
