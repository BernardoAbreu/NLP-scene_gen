<L>__{interior orthanc ante chamber day}
<A>__{saruman and gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber.}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{sauron has regained much of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. concealed within his fortress, the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf...a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{the eye of sauron.}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{he is gathering all evil to him.}
<C>__{saruman }
<D>__{very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon middle earth.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{you know this? how?}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{i have seen it.}
<A>__{gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman.}
<A>__{saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir.}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{why? why should we fear to use it?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{they are not all accounted for, the lost seeing stones...we do not know who else may be watching. gandalf throws the cloth back over the palantir.}
<A>__{flash image: a fiery eye! saruman sits upon his throne.}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{the hour is later than you think. sauron's forces are already moving...the nine have left minas morgul.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{the nine!}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{they crossed the river isen in midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in black.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{they have reached the shire? saruman shrugs...}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{they will find the ring...and kill the one who carries it.}
<A>__{gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut.}
<C>__{saruman }
<D>__{you did not seriously think a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can.}
<A>__{gandalf slowly turns to saruman...a look of dawning horror.}
<C>__{saruman }
<D>__{against the power of mordor, there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(deadly)}
<D>__{tell me, friend, when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness?}
<A>__{at that moment: gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room! he slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on saruman...blasting him off his feet! gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing! gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it flies across the chamber into saruman's hand! gandalf is flung to the floor.}
<C>__{saruman}
<D>__{i gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain.}
<A>__{gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of saruman... commanding two staffs, saruman sends gandalf into a sickening spin. gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. rushing pov: the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera.}
