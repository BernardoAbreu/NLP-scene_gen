<A>__{the plan shows two doors in relation to the stairway. the first one is clearly marked: "my room." the adjoining door is marked: "my father's room."}
<B>__{close shot guy}
<A>__{he pauses at the first door, then passes it quietly, walking on to the next one. he turns the knob soundlessly and passes through into the room.}
<L>__{interior antony bedroom long shot}
<A>__{the room is in darkness except for the dim outline of the recumbent figure in the bed. we hear guy's voice, in a loud whisper:}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{mr. antony!}
<A>__{the figure stirs.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{guy takes a stop closer to the bed.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{mr. antony! don't be alarmed but i must talk to you about your son. about bruno. mr. antony!}
<A>__{the figure on the bed turns and a hand stretches out toward a bedside light. the light goes on with a sudden glare. closeup face of bruno in the light (low camera) the low camera throws a vast shadow up on the wall behind him, creating a grimace of his smile.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{yes, mr. haines?}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{his face is dead.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{bruno rises from the bed and sits on the and of it. he is fully dressed, just as he was at the party, in white tie and tails.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{my father isn't home tonight, mr. haines.}
<P>__{(smiles grimly at guy's surprise)}
<D>__{i was about to tell you that over the phone. but you came to such a sudden decision. i wondered why.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(recovering quickly)}
<D>__{since you sent me a key to your house, i decided to use it to make a little social call on your father. i thought he'd be interested to know he his a lunatic son.}
<A>__{the faintest flicker of bruno's eyes indicates the intensity of his reaction. he stares hard at guy.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{then a i correct, mr. haines, in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no intention whatsoever. i never had.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i see. you won't have any further use for the key, then, mr. haines.}
<P>__{(he holds out his}
<D>__{hand and guy gives}
<P>__{him the key)}
<D>__{thank you very such.}
<A>__{as bruno continues to stare at him, guy takes out the luger. for a moment a look of fear comes into bruno's face as he thinks guy will probably shoot him. after a pause, guy tosses the gun on the bed.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{or this.}
<A>__{bruno's relief turns again to menace. he picks up the gun and fingers it nervously.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{look, bruno. you're terribly sick.}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{i don't know whether it's possible for you to realize it or not. i don't know much about these things, bruno. but why don't you go someplace where you can get some treatment? not only for your own sake, bruno, but you can't go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet.}
<A>__{bruno pays no attention. he rises.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{guy's arguments have made no impression on bruno whatsoever. he fingers the gun.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i don't like to be doublecrossed.}
<C>__{bruno }
<D>__{i have a murder on my conscience, but it's not my murder, mr. haines it's yours. and as you're the one to profit, i think you should be the one to pay for it.}
<A>__{for an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with the urge to kill guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(gives up)}
<D>__{well, i guess it's no use, bruno. we sees to have nothing further to discuss.}
<A>__{bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it for guy to pass through.}
