<L>__{interior hardware store day}
<A>__{happy music. the hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly stockboy. the music turns tense as elijah appears and scans the shelf. he makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles. he grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag. darkness.}
<L>__{exterior freakland then}
<A>__{the bag opens, elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer. the music turns to psycho like string stabs as elijah uses the hammer to smash in a nail.}

<A>__{the worm shakes his head. the freaks turn and head back to their cubicles. rick exchanges a look with julie before she and ernie turn and head off. rick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer.}
