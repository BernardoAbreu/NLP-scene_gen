<A>__{brent steps down into the basement. it is a combination prison bedroom. it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. water drips for the ceiling. rat traps are everywhere. old broken child's toys are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which are bolted into the wall above a cot. the cot is small, the mattress rotted. old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall. huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner. brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it. he pulls out a pair of grown man's trousers. he examines them.}
