<L>__{exterior business district evening}
<A>__{a fashionable area. expensive shops, well kept streets and sidewalks. a television store has caught chance's eye. he stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color tvs, all turned on, playing various channels. a video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an advent tv. chance is intrigued by his own image. he poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it is really him on television. he moves forward, smiles, then moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the screen. he steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the advent. standing between two parked cars, chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the advent. four or five other sets in the window change channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. as he does this, the car to his,left, a large, american made limousine, backs up. the car bumps chance, pins him against the car to his right. chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo. the chauffeur, david, and the liveryman, jeffrey, immediately jump from the car, run back to chance.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm very sorry, sir... i...}
<A>__{david and jeffrey reach out to help, but chance is wedged solidly between the two cars.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{... i can't move... my leg...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(rushes back to limo)}
<D>__{... my lord...}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{this is terrible, sir i hope you're not badly injured...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. i'm not badly injured. but my leg is very sore.}
<A>__{david pulls the car forward, freeing chance. a few bystanders begin to gather as jeffrey helps chance to the sidewalk.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{can you walk? it's not broken, is it?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(leans against limo, holds leg)}
<D>__{it's very sore.}
<A>__{david gets out of the car, comes back.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{perhaps i should call an ambulance.}
<A>__{a bystander interrupts.}
<C>__{bystander}
<D>__{somebody ought to call the police!}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(looks over, smiles)}
<D>__{there's no need for police, it's just my leg.}
<A>__{during this, the rear door of the limo opens and eve rand steps out. eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a traditional new england lady. she watches as jeffrey tends to chance.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(obviously hurting)}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{let's have a look, do you mind?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{of course. i would like to look.}
<A>__{chance bends, raises his trouser leg. a red bluish swollen bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{it's starting to swell, is it painful?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{eve moves closer to chance, looks at the bruise.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to chance)}
<D>__{... won't you let us do something for you? your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(smiles at eve)}
<D>__{there's no need for a hospital.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{why, there certainly is. you must see a doctor, i insist on it. please, let us take you.}
<A>__{eve turns to get back into the limo. david goes with her to hold the door.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm terribly sorry, mrs. rand, i never saw the man.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh, i don't think it was anyone's fault, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thank you, ma'am.}
<A>__{chance is hesitant about getting in the car. jeffrey offers a helping hand.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{please, sir.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i've never ridden in an automobile.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i assure you, sir, david is a very careful driver. please, won't you let us take you?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(looks at the car, then decides)}
<D>__{... yes. you can take me.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{jeffrey assists chance into the rear seat of the limo.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(as he gets in)}
<D>__{... my suitcase.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{yes sir. i will take care of that.}
<A>__{jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up chance's suitcase, does not notice the remote control. as jeffrey puts chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license plate "rand l."}
