<C>__{frances}
<D>__{it's a perfectly good car. it runs.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes, but... really, i hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. people won't take you seriously.}

<D>__{i don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. or my car.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{uh huh. you mean what if the public finds out i perspire? and wear slacks. and drive an old jalopy? what if they find out i'm a real person. oh no! say it ain't so! not a real person!}
