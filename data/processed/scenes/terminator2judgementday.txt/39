<A>__{reverse angle as she turns slowly into close up. sarah connor is not the same woman we remember from last time. her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal. defiant and intense, but skittering around looking for escape at the same time. fight or flight. down one cheek is a long scar, from just below the eye to her upper lip. her voice is a low and chilling monotone.}
