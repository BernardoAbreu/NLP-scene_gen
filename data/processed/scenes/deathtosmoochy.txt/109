<L>__{interior sheldon's penthouse night}
<A>__{nora is pacing. sheldon sits by the fire.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's stokes. he's behind the whole thing! he cut some kind of deal for the smoochy slot!}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{he wants you out so he can put takashi in!}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{who's takashi?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{jesus, sheldon! don't you ever pick up a copy of international performer? he's the hottest kid show host from asia.}
<A>__{sheldon's head is swimming. suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open. randolph, dressed like he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{ah! how very cozy. like two logs in a little bonfire. all we need is a few sticks and some wienies.}
<A>__{he almost trips as he stumbles over to sheldon. he waves the gun in his face.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i had her before you! pachyderm! i was in love with her! in love! and you snatched her away! like a common thief! you're the bad guy! not me! he's the bad guy, nora. he's incapable of understanding the love we once had! tender, yet passionate. old fashioned, yet experimental.}
<P>__{(cackles)}
<D>__{tell him about a few of our experiments, nora! tell him!}
<A>__{sheldon looks stunned. nora hangs her head.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(to nora)}
<D>__{is this true? please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind.}
<A>__{she looks at him, but doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{holy mother of toledo. when exactly were you planning to let me know about this?!}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(turns to sheldon)}
<D>__{listen, there was a time and i'm not proud of this but there was a time when i was a bit of a... kiddie host groupie.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{you're just another action figure for her collection!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{that's not fair!}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{tell him about jingle jackson!}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you dated jingle jackson?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{the bells turned her on. hey, tell him about jumbo johnny! there's a tale for ya! a whale of a tale!}
<A>__{she looks down, somewhat ashamed. a look of utter shock comes over sheldon.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{oh good lord in heaven.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{look, what i did before i met you is none of your business.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{shut up! both of you! this is my show!}
<A>__{he waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{do you fully understand the power of a condemned man? do you? i'm already wanted for one murder, why should i give a flaming horse's twat if i commit two more?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. to that end, would you like to hear a funny joke?}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes)}
<D>__{oh, please. go blow yourself, martha.}
<P>__{(waves gun again)}
<D>__{fix me a beverage, woman. make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy bouncy time!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{fix it yourself, asshole.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(points to gun)}
<D>__{remember, i have mr. boomy.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm telling you, you'd love this joke. it revolves around santa claus and the easter bunny getting into a fender bender.}
<A>__{nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(to sheldon)}
<D>__{you know, when i lived here i used to have a big painting above the fireplace. a naked chick holding a pumpkin. it was very tasteful. no bush...}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{look, randolph. we know it wasn't you who killed spinner.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{we'll go to the police, first thing tomorrow... straighten everything out.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{oh! goody goody gumdrops!}
<P>__{(to nora)}
<D>__{vodka straight up is fine, sugar babe!}
<A>__{he grabs the bottle out of her hand. he rises from the chair. he takes a cd, "party time with rainbow randolph," from his pocket and puts it into an audio system on the fireplace wall.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{did you put on a little weight, honey? that's okay, you're still a hot little brood mare. i bet you miss the sweet sting of my riding crop. giddy up, pony!}
<A>__{the theme song from his show starts to play. he flicks a switch and a spotlight goes on. he sings and dances.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(to tune of 'ol' macdonald)}
<D>__{'rainbow randolph is the man. yes he, yes he, is. he's the prez of rainbowland. yes he, yes he, is. with some fun, fun here, and a laugh, laugh there. here a dance, there a song, everything is fun, fun. rainbow randolph is the king, the king of rainbowland!'}
<A>__{randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle. sheldon suddenly lunges at randolph and tries to grab the gun. randolph shrieks. the two men wrestle on the floor, but randolph is not much of a fighter. he screams as sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{is this what you want? a hansel and gretel ending?! you want to be the big bad wolf?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{stop! it's too hot! the heat! it's driving me mad!}
<A>__{randolph rolls sheldon to the bottom. nora reaches for a fireplace poker and whacks randolph with it. randolph cries out and drops the gun. sheldon grabs it and points it at randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a child. he's bleeding.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{go ahead, kill me! finish me off. my life's over anyway. everything i touch turns to shit. put me out of my misery.}
<A>__{sheldon slowly takes the gun away from randolph's head.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you're not nothing. you're bitter, misguided and i'm guessing a raging alcoholic, but you're still rainbow randolph. despite everything that's happened, you once made children happy.}
<A>__{randolph sits up and looks at sheldon through watery eyes.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{would you be my friend?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(to nora)}
<D>__{you too?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{sorry about the brood mare stuff.}
<A>__{randolph throws his arms around sheldon and cries into his shoulder. sheldon pats his back. he glances down at randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy. nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from one of the chairs. she kneels next to randolph and blots the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow. randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.}
