<L>__{interior city morgue day}
<A>__{a lab tech, ricco, leads brian and rimgale through the autopsy area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered in plastic.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{okay, alan seagrave and donald cosgrove...}
<A>__{if you say so. brian's stomach does a half gainer as he's confronted by two hideously charred bodies.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{...both deaths due to close encounters with stationary objects; office door for mr. cosgrove, '89 porsche for mr. seagrave. no non relevant traumas. no significant blood toxicology. attitude of both trajectories consistent with explosions.}
<A>__{brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. it's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. burns almost completely away when you light it.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{putty? on both doors?}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{there's something else kinda interesting...}
<A>__{ricco lifts benton's charred shoulder. underneath we see some of his clothes that have melted and co mingled with his flesh.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{see this?}
<A>__{a credit card has been fried right into cosgrove's skin about where his back pocket should have been.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{guess he didn't leave home without it.}
<A>__{ricco erupts in a honking laugh, then switches instantly back to a business tone.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{anyway, down here, take a look...}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{mccaffrey, hold this for us.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{uh, i don't think that's in my contract...}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{i just re wrote your contract. c'mere...}
<A>__{with supreme reluctance brian pulls the crisper's head and shoulder away from the table.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{jesus christ, he isn't gonna try to sell you insurance, lift him.}
<A>__{brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher.}
<C>__{ricco}
<P>__{(to rimgale)}
<D>__{see that patch of shirt? we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate. nobody around here had ever heard of it.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{trychticholorate? alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. it's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{probably got in cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{what the hell was it doing in the fire?}
<C>__{ricco}
<D>__{that's your job.}
<A>__{at that instant, cosgrove's eyes open and his body sighs. brian drops the body in shock and backs away, stunned.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{i asked you to hold him, not feel him up...}
