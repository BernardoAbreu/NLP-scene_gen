<A>__{seq. 100 meet the croods a huge caveman, grug, rushes forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a threat display. he blinks in the bright morning light. he lifts and hurls a large boulder.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{raaaaar groooooooooooowwwll erf erf glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!}
<A>__{as suddenly as he began, grug stops. panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. grug turns to the cave entrance, he prepares to bellow a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips a cave girl, eep, bursts from the cave.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{you're supposed to wait for my signal eep. eep?}
<A>__{eep scares a pack of nearby liyotes away. they pounce on grug briefly before scampering off. eep spreads out on an overhanging rock. she basks in the sun.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{we've been in that cave forever.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{three days is not forever.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{it is with this family.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{eep would you come down here? you're being so dramatic.}
<A>__{a little girl, sandy, charges out nexterior her display is more terrier like.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{no, no, no sandy, come back here. remember the signal. good girls wait for the signal.}
<A>__{a cave woman, ugga, scrambles out nexterior she is mostly focused on catching sandy, giving only cursory effort to her display.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{ugga.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{as soon as i get sandy, i will go back in, and you can give the signal.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no, i mean, you're already out now.}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{i am waiting for the signal, dad.}
<A>__{we hear the voice of grug's nine year old son from inside the cave. thunk is eager to please his dad and emulates his every move.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{never mind, thunk. just, come out.}
<C>__{thunk}
<P>__{(not so fast)}
<D>__{uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do i know you're my dad?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{the signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know i wasn't eaten by an animal.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{then why is the signal an animal noise? i mean, doesn't that just confuse things?}
<A>__{grug sighs.}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{i don't know... i'm still waiting for the signal.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{sigh. hoo hooooo! hoo hooooo!}
<A>__{thunk comes out growling, and barrels into grug. thunk picks up a boulder and throws it. it ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into grug. grug gets plowed over by the boulder.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{mom, we're ready to leave.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mom!}
<A>__{grug sits up and smiles.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{still alive!}
<A>__{grug's face drops.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{it's still early.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{and you're still fat.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{breakfast formation!}
<A>__{the croods form up in a flying wedge, with grug in the lead.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{i want to see some real caveman action out there. we do this fast. we do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid. go!}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{yay, breakfast!!!!}
<A>__{compressed time the croods run out of crood canyon, across the wide expanses of desert.}
