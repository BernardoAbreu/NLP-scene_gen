<L>__{interior room}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{anybody home?}
<A>__{a demonic cackle cuts through the darkness.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{no one here but us chickens.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{say, it's pretty dark in here, sir.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{what do you expect, theodore, a fuckin' floor show?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i don't know. do you?}
<A>__{in a flash the lights switch on and ted finds himself staring down the barrel of a pretty intense looking .357 magnum, cocked and ready to fire. at the other end of the gun stands a 50 year old man, sigfried, who sports a cheshire cat smile and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. sigfried isn't the only person in the room. directly behind him sits a beautiful young woman, angela, gagged and bound to a chair. ted drops the bucket to the floor.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i brought your ice.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that's cute. in fact, the whole getup's kind of cute. the monkey suit's a nice touch, honey puss.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{this has to be a mistake. is this room 404?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{theodore? what do you take me for, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a very upset man?}
<A>__{sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like they were breath mints. sigfried thrusts his hand forward, gripping ted by the throat, and leads him to angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{i am an upset man, theodore.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{how do you know my name, sir?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i'm psychic, theodore.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look my name is ted, actually, and i have no idea what's going on here, but i've obviously come at a bad time.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, theodore. the fact is you're here.}
<A>__{sigfried turns to angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and i couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on new year's eve.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh fuck, there's a mistake. you're fucking wrong here. my name is theodore, yes! my mother named me that and i hate the name. but i'm a fucking bellhop. people call me ted. i work here.}
<A>__{suddenly, with great force, sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into ted's temple, sending him to the floor. ted looks up at sigfried in shock.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{look, i'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that was insensitive of me, wasn't it, t h e o d o r e? but let's cut to the chase, okay?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{so apologize!}
<A>__{a tense silence fills the room. all eyes are on ted, who can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{sigfried looks hard with disbelief at ted, who winces back.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you are really beginning to annoy me, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, obviously you two are working something out and if i could help you with your problem i would.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{what are you saying? are you saying i got a problem? are you trying to say i don't give her what she needs? that i'm fucking insensitive!!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, is this about another man? or something?}
<A>__{ted has struck a raw nerve. sigfried's mood swings drastically; he bends down next to ted.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{let's get our abc's right, here, theodore. theodore, right?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ted's better.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{ted, okay... are you saying my wife cheats on me?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i didn't say that... i...}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake, theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and angela here. it's pretty cozy. to say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. i demand an apology!}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{don't move. i've got to take this.}
<A>__{sigfried glances at it. then to angela. he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we ain't got any needles here, kid. just a big fucking gun.}
<A>__{he listens to the other line, says good bye, and hangs up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{now, where was i? oh yeah, i remember.}
<A>__{sigfried kneels next to ted and assumes a prayer position.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i want you to pray for forgiveness, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for ted to do the same. the gun lies at his side. ted considers a bold move, but thinks better of it. sigfried's eyes pop open. he cuts a look to ted, signaling him to assume the pose.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now say after me, "i apologize..."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i apologize...}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{ted looks to angela for help. she can only stare back with intense, wide open eyes.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{for fucking what?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that i said you might have been unfaithful?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{"that i said you might have been unfaithful?" listen, theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. truth... truth is all it hears. say the following, "i, theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!"}
<A>__{ted repeats what sigfried has told him. this appears to have a calming effect on sigfried, who gets up off the floor, turning his face to angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{satisfied?}
<A>__{angela nods.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you accept the fucking apology?}
<A>__{naturally, angela says nothing.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you always gotta get the last word, don't you? it's one way with you, angela, isn't it? i give and i give and i get nothing back.}
<A>__{sigfried turns to ted.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops...}
<A>__{angela attempts to speak through the gag. both men wait with bated breath for a response. sigfried's had enough.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stupid me, for a second i thought you were going to say something... something like, "i'm sorry." ha! "i'm sorry." you're absolutely right, love cakes, i wouldn't want it that way. that's one thing you can say about angela. she'll never do anything she doesn't want to do. if the feeling ain't there, she just isn't going to do it. there is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesn't want to. never let that happen to you, theodore. it makes you feel very little indeed.}
<A>__{ted beckons sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mind if i...?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{go ahead. spit it out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't mean to upset you further, sir, but i think she was trying to say yes.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{are you condescending to me, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{absolutely not, i would never do that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{why don't you just say it?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{say what?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that you think i'm an idiot.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i would never say that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you think you're superior to me, don't ya, theodore? you don't think i notice there is a gag in the woman's mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{of course you do.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{naturally "of course." and do you know how i know that?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{how, sir?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{because i put the gag in her mouth! i'm gonna let you in on a little secret about communication, theodore. it's all in the eyes...}
<P>__{(points the gun at ted)}
<D>__{him?}
<P>__{(turns the gun on himself)}
<D>__{or me? him or me? no one? okay. let's drag it out.}
<A>__{sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving the empty bottle over his shoulder. he takes off, disappearing into the bathroom.}
