<A>__{starks, determined, now leads jackie. as they reach the end of the hall, we see damon now in his 50s look after them curiously before he goes back to his work with a patient.}

<A>__{jackie watches starks ignore the "authorized personnel only" sign as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause.}
<L>__{interior morgue, basement, alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{the morgue looks exactly as before. starks is momentarily jarred in the room. he looks to the wall on which the jacket hung and sees only the bare hooks that used to hold it up.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{this was the room. they used to hang the jacket there. [turning to jackie] this is where it happened. this is the room i'm actually in right now.}
<A>__{jackie isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be convinced...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i can show you. it's probably in there.}
<A>__{starks walks to the cadaver drawers and rests his hands on the one they put him in. then, with great difficulty physical and emotional he opens it to see if there is anything left. he pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{maybe this wasn't such a good idea...}
<A>__{starks leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the stained metal still reddened and browned with dried blood and the part of the morgue slab he clawed his nails into when he was in it. jackie looks at it in disbelief.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yes, it was. [softly] my fingers were the only things i could move. [beat] dead bodies don't bleed. and they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal.}
