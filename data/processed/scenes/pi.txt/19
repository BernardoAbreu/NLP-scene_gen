<L>__{interior apartment staircase day}
<A>__{max heads up the stairs to his apartment. just then, a toy slinky appears from nowhere marching down the stairs. max stops and waits until the slinky hits his foot. he picks it up and looks at it. he looks around wondering what's going on. then jenna leans out over a railing and starts laughing at max.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{max sits at the counter frantically looking at the wall street journal. he plops three pills into his coffee. he draws circles and other shapes across the page. max is interrupted by a puff of smoke. at the same time, someone touches his shoulder and says:}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{hey, max, how you doing?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{lenny meyer.}
<P>__{(motioning to the cigarette)}
<D>__{i will put it out.}
<P>__{(which be does)}
<D>__{so, what do you do?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{um, i work with computers ...math.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{really? what type of math?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{number theory. mostly research.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{number theory? no way, i work in theory, too. not traditional, though...}
<P>__{(points to his yarmulke)}
<D>__{i work with the torah.}
<P>__{(awed by the coincidence)}
<D>__{amazing.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(passing it of as a coincidence)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yeah. you know hebrew is all numbers. it's all math.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{lenny pulls out a worn' dog eared bible from his pocket. there are paper slips marking what seems like every other page. when he opens it up, max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens, notes and diagrams. lenny points to the texterior extreme close up of hebrew letters.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{here, look...the ancient jews used hebrew as their numerical system. each letter is a number.}
<A>__{lenny pulls out a pen and grabs max's journal. he writes on it as he talks.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you see...the hebrew "a," the number 1. the hebrew "b," bet, is two. you can take any hebrew text and turn them into a long string of numbers.}
<A>__{the waitress refills max's coffee.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{the torah is just a long string of numbers. some say that it's a long code sent to us from god.}
<A>__{satisfied, lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(mildly impressed)}
<D>__{kind of interesting.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<P>__{(proud of himself)}
<D>__{yeah, like take the hebrew word for, say, the garden of eden, kadem. kuf, dalei mem...kuf is a hundred. daled, four mem, forty. they equal one hundred and forty four. then take the tree of knowledge...in the garden, aat ha haim, it equals two hundred and thirty three. now you can take that number and...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they're fibonacci numbers.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the fibonacci sequence. italian mathematician, thirteenth century. if you divide a hundred and forty four into two hundred and thirty three, it approaches theta.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{theta?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the greek symbol for the golden ratio. the golden spiral.}
<A>__{lenny exhales the smoke. max quickly graphs the number on his wall street journal.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you're right, i never saw that before. that's the series you find in nature. like the face of a sunflower.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{wherever there's spirals.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you see, there's math everywhere.}
<A>__{lenny's smoke drifts by max's eyes. slow motion: max's pov of smoke spirals spinning in front of him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{math everywhere...}
<A>__{slow motion: max looks down at his coffee cup. he pours cream into his coffee. it shoots up and mixes with the black coffee forming spirals in the mug.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{everywhere...}
<A>__{slow motion: max looks at the spiral he just drew on the wall street journal. normal speed suddenly, max stands up.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh my god...}
