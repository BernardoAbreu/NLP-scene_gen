<A>__{annie is awake reading the faxes lucy sent. one after other. as she flips through them, one falls to the floor near the bed. she gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something under the bed. an old, battered cello case. she pulls it out to find the initials r.b. carved on the top. she opens it to find papers, receipts, bills all from tom's married life.}
