<A>__{the camera angle on hackman begins to switch perspectives and spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three dimensions.}
<C>__{castle}
<D>__{he's so perfect.}
<A>__{snap out to reveal castle in a dark lounge; the walls and ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the dimensions of the room. minimalist, expensive looking furniture is scattered around. there's no one else in the}
<B>__{room.}
<A>__{castle is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. he is manipulating the image of hackman in the air by pulling, squeezing, twisting with his hands the interface is similar to the one in simon's room. castle is as pumped as a kid on christmas morning. then, from behind him:}
<C>__{castle 2}
<D>__{he's scary.}
<A>__{we see that a perfect double of castle himself has appeared in the room behind him.}
<C>__{castle}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{he changes the angle on hackman's mug to give a better view then turns to face his double...}
<C>__{castle }
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{the new face of slayers. pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's so what they want.}
<C>__{castle 2}
<P>__{(playing dumb)}
<D>__{but they love kable.}

<C>__{castle 3}
<D>__{he's right.}
<A>__{castle faces them.}
<C>__{castle}
<P>__{(unaffected)}
<D>__{they do now. but when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh trust me, they'll change their point of view.}
<C>__{castle 2}
<D>__{how can you be sure?}
<C>__{castle}
<D>__{it's human nature. they'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...}

<C>__{castle 2}
<D>__{tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer you dropped him in with common murderers. what did you expect?}
