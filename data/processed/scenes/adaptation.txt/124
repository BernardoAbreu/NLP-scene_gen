<L>__{exterior empty beach day}
<A>__{kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. an attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in german. he watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. he doesn't get it. they're gone. a tan older man sits on the bench, lights a cigarette. kaufman continues to look at the ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. he doesn't want to engage.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{we could use the rain, huh?}
<A>__{kaufman nods, looking at the ocean. pause.}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{so you from around here?}
<A>__{kaufman shakes his head "no." pause.}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{so where then?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{california.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{yeah? i'm moving to l.a. i just wrote a screenplay. i sent it to a lot of agents. but if they turn me down, i will go there and market it myself. i used to be in marketing in new york, so i know exactly how to sell this thing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where's a nice place to live if you don't have a car?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{you kind of need a car. i guess west hollywood would be okay.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{so you recommend west hollywood then.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'm not recommending it.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{i moved down here for a change, and i wrote the screenplay. just like that. it's a great idea.}
<A>__{the old guy waits for a response. he gets none.}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{it's about a mob guy, but it's not your regular mob story. there's a twist. a cop tells this mob guy's wife that the mob guy's cheating on her. but the truth is, the cop's lying because he wants her for himself. see, they used to go together in high school.}
<P>__{(waits for response, then:)}
<D>__{you know anything about screenplays?}
<A>__{kaufman shakes his head.}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{well, the object is to make people think you're going in one direction, then you twist it to keep 'em surprised. i came up with all these amazing twists out of nowhere. well, not nowhere.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm a born again christian.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you have faith?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{you don't believe in anything?}
<A>__{kaufman shrugs.}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{i don't know how you can look out at this beautiful ocean and not believe there's an intelligence that created it.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{well, you can't know until you experience it. that requires accepting jesus christ as your lord and savior. believe me. lookit, if i was to show you a bottle of clear liquid and told you it was vodka, how would you know if it really was or if it was water? there's only one way.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'd smell it.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{no. you can't smell vodka. you'd have to taste it, right?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{it could be poison. i don't know you.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{look, let's go with the analogy i'm drawing here. it's not poison. okay?}
<P>__{(resuming control)}
<C>__{guy on bench }
<D>__{so you'd have to taste it to know. right? that's my pointerior}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{guy on bench}
<D>__{that's all i'm saying.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so west hollywood, huh? i think i will make it out this year. because how long can you look at an ocean, y'know?}
