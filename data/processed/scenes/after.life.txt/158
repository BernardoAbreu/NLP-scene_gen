<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room same time}
<A>__{anna lies down on the slab. closes her eyes. eliot's voice seems far away now. receding.}
<C>__{eliot }

<L>__{interior funeral home. basement corridor continuous}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she needs my help.}

<D>__{you can't help her anymore. believe me.}
<L>__{interior police station day}
<A>__{an open plan office. paul weaves quickly through the rows of desks. he seems unbalanced. manic. detectives cautiously watch paul approach tom sitting at his desk, his head bent over paperwork.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i need you to issue a search warrant.}
<A>__{tom looks up. he's shocked by paul's appearance.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{i need a fucking search warrant. now are you going to help me or what?}
<A>__{jeff (20s) a young detective at a nearby desk stands. tom nods to him. it's under control.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{paul. sit down.}
<A>__{paul hesitates for a second.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{sit. down.}
<A>__{paul sits. tom leans forward. he's not amused.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{just what the hell do you think you're doing? i got a call from eliot deane. are you out of your fucking mind?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna's not dead tom. he won't let me see her. he's keeping her there }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{anna was in a car accident. her car was wrecked paul. remember? it's downstairs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's not dead.}
<A>__{tom calmly gets up. moves to a filing cabinet. takes out a file. hands it to paul.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{here's the coroner's report.}
<A>__{paul manically rifles through the file.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{look.}
<P>__{(shows file to tom)}
<D>__{the paramedics phoned it in. they only checked for eye dilation and pulse. the doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{so? that's standard procedure.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there was no eeg. nothing. he could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{drugged her? are you serious?}
<A>__{jeff looks up eagerly from his desk.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{there are drugs like that chief. hydronium bromide. total paralysis within seconds. the heartbeat slows to almost nothing.}
<A>__{tom shoots jeff a look.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{see? i'm telling you. she's not dead. the boy at school. jack. he saw her.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{i saw her.}
<A>__{paul turns hopefully. finally someone believes him. vincent merano stands by jeff's desk.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{she was on the slab. dead.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i've seen dead bodies. believe me, she was definitely dead.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{tom. just go down there and check the place out.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{on what grounds paul? do you have any evidence?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. but }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{do you have anything?}
<A>__{paul hesitates. we sense his uncertainty.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i think she called me.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{called you?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{on the telephone.}
<A>__{jeff snickers. paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{collect or long distance?}
<A>__{jeff snorts with laughter.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{first you hit a fucking kid. then you attack deane. and now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? what the fuck's going on? you're loosing it paul.}
<A>__{merano and jeff shake their heads, looking at paul as if he were crazy. tom's voice softens.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together.}
<A>__{paul slumps in the chair. rubs his face.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{maybe you're right. but why won't he let me see her?}
<A>__{tom signals to merano and jeff. merano walks back to his desk. jeff turns back to his work.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look paul. the funeral's tomorrow. you'll see her then. it'll help. it will give you closure. trust me.}
