<L>__{interior knights inn game room day}
<A>__{gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. bullseye. merlin and jumpy haul rudy in. he collapses at gabriel's feet, unable to stand. still trembling. a couple kids scamper into the doorway }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{game room's closed.}
<A>__{ and merlin slams the door in their face. gabriel hurls another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a for effort, nick, honestly, a for effort and an honorary degree. i'm surprised you never escaped from the mountain.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(teeth chattering)}
<D>__{...never... tried...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{nick, here's what we're gonna do. in the spirit of the season, i'm going to give you a chance. i understand you're unhappy. right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on tv.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so we're gonna have a contest.}
<A>__{gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{we're each going to get one of these. whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye... gets what he wants.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you land closer, you get ashley. and you guys get to go free. i land closer... and we start getting your help.}
<A>__{he lifts rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. rudy's fingers are half frozen, they don't bend. gabriel has to wedge it in.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{may the best sportsman win.}
<A>__{gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his dart. it thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{he steps aside for rudy. rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. he focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws except the dart remains in his frozen grip. he brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. and the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet. gabriel smiles, steps close.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{got something to say to me, nick?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{...ttt..tt... two out of three?}
<A>__{gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. rudy crashes into a chair, flanked by video games.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{what'd you tell that casino manager?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nnn... nothing...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nothing... i promise nothing...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{maybe something about a robbery?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. he whistles a dart at rudy's head. it smacks the wall beside his ear. he whistles another. it trunks right above his head. a third hits the wall by his chin.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{he thought i was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...}
<A>__{gabriel flings another dart. just misses rudy's other ear.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{...dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's bitching 'bout the count...}
<A>__{another dart nails the wall, right through rudy's hair.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{...got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the dot at the top. and every day, every day, i see all those faces in their little airbag hot wheels, moms and pops and jam faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. hey. they don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise.}
<A>__{gabriel strides to rudy, sitting stock still, his head ringed by darts. stares him down.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you.}
<P>__{(frightening calm)}
<D>__{did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no, gabriel... no...}
<A>__{gabriel pulls the darts free. backs away again.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{...he... he asked me... how i'd heard about his place... he didn't know it was me...}
<B>__{gabriel raises a dart to throw}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i promise you he didn't know it was me!}
<A>__{ and then lowers it. believing he's gotten a reprieve, rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{nick. i been trying to hit you.}
<A>__{gabriel rears back and whistles another dart. it plugs into rudy's chest. rudy screams. gabriel fires another, skewering him in the ribs. then a third, fourth and fifth. rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. five darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering and spreading rivulets of blood.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{maybe that'll help sharpen your memory.}
<A>__{gabriel stalks close.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. and this time you're gonna tell me what i need to know.}
