<A>__{winters and galen howard are walking across the field after practice. the stadium is deserted.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i been talkin' to chancellor wilson...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what's he wanta do now, cut practice down to once a week?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{no, he's happy with the way the season's gone so far. the alumni have pretty much stayed off his back, but with joe out now, it could all be up for grabs again.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{he thinks he's gonna have trouble marchin' the ball down the old fund raisin' board, huh?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{the facts are, all we have left are freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' i saw at practice today, convinced me that any of them are ready to step in.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what are you sayin?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{we gotta get bobby collins back.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{wilson say that?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{he didn't have to.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{forget it, galen, collins is no all star either.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{yeh, but he's good enough to get us a split of the next four games.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{look, just because you're wilson's boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean i'm gonna let him make me look like a fuckin' whore.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{don't give me that high and mighty shit. there's a lotta people on the bubble here. four straight loses and we're out of bowl contention. how's that gonna make you look? if you're too stupid to consider your own situation, then maybe you oughta think about your assistant coaches. they've got families to feed too.}
<A>__{howard walks away, pissed off, leaving winters alone in the middle of the field.}
