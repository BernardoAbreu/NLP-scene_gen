<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(newscaster's voice)}
<D>__{is it safe to assume since the law enforcement authorities in the great state of texas are homosexuals of a sick and deviate nature, that they will be too busy fucking each other up the ass to actually catch the gecko brothers?}
<P>__{(in an fbi voice)}
<D>__{i would say that's a very safe assumption.}
<A>__{he changes a channel on the television. we see a casper the friendly ghost cartoon on the screen.}
<C>__{casper}
<D>__{would you play with me?}
<A>__{a big burly cop turns around.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{sure, little boy... a ghost!!!}
<A>__{the cop heads for the hills. casper cries. seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two take out bags of big kahuna burgers.}
<C>__{richard}

<C>__{richard}
<D>__{didya look at the border?}
<A>__{seth dumps the burgers on the bed. both men pop open beers and richard goes to town on a hamburger. seth flips off the tv}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, i saw the border. through binoculars from on top of a high building. that's about as close as i risked getting. what's the tv say?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{they're going to apprehend us in forty eight hours.}
<A>__{seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. longer we fuck around el paso our lives ain't worth a shit.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{look, fuck the border. let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. we showed our ass in texas. we killed texas fuckin' rangers. they ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i heard it on the radio. we gotta get our asses into mexico tonight. carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and }

<D>__{what?}
<A>__{seth's out of his chair.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what'd ya mean, what? the fuckin' woman, the hostage. where the fuck is she, richard!?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{she's in the other room.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck is she doin' there?!}
<A>__{he goes to the door of the adjoining room.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{seth, before you open the door, let me explain what happened.}
<A>__{seth stops and looks at his brother. he knows what he means. he can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling. then he bursts open the door. the dead, naked body of gloria hill lies on the bed. it's obvious richard raped her and killed her. seth covers his eyes with his hands. he slowly enters the room with the dead body.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh, richard, what's wrong with you?}
<A>__{richard rises from the bed.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{now, seth, before you flip out, let me just explain what happened.}
<A>__{seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him. richard backs up.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, explain it to me. i need an explanation. what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(low and calm)}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong with me, brother. that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! once you left, she became a whole different person.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(slowly approaching)}
<D>__{is it me? is it my fault?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{it's not your fault, it's her fault!}
<A>__{seth grabs richard and throws him in the corner of the room, holding tightly to his wrist.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{is this my fault? do you think this is what i am?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{this is not me! i am a professional fucking thief. i steal money. you try to stop me, god help you. but i don't kill people i don't have to, and i don't rape women. what you doin' ain't how it's done. do you understand?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{seth, if you were me }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{just say yes! nothing else, just say yes.}
<C>__{richard}
