<A>__{trinity's cabin. at first we see only stars twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background. the camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. the artwork terminates in the metal ring going around her room. it's a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. the articles she's collected during her time in the resistance dot the cabin. an unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. there are charcoal portraits of loved ones. softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. the neb is still in tow. neo is sitting against the wall on trin's bed, with her curled up beside him with her head on his lap. neo cant sleep. he stares at the wall opposite him. there's a photo of the crew of the neb, sans trin, in better days. smiling, laughing as they are seated around the table. morpeus, tank, dozer, switch, epoch, mouse. neo stops on the image of a smiling cypher. there's an unknown asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. gently, placing trinity's head down, neo stands and examines the photo.}
