<L>__{exterior george's garage evening}
<A>__{sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet to the ocean; guster is whining for attention behind sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, get over here, then, stupid.}
<A>__{guster inches forward on his belly, which makes sam smile.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{are you afraid of heights, guster?}
<A>__{sam drops to his belly and stretches out to pet guster.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{the fall probably wouldn't kill me, anyway.}
<A>__{guster inches closer and licks sam's face. george walks out with a tray filled with spaghetti, garlic bread and a coke.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thinking of jumping?}
<A>__{george sets the tray on the ground beside sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{pushing.}
<A>__{george walks to the edge of the cliff.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock. the water will take you out. let it. swim a little north and you'll see the sand.}
<A>__{sam sits up and faces his father with a trace of alarm.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{first time i did it, younger than you, i thought i'd break my neck and just sort of float to catalina.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't always get what you wish for, sam.}
<A>__{george suddenly leaps forward and disappears into the sea as a wave crashes against the rocks below.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{sam scurries to his feet and scans the ocean for his father; the only thing visible is darkness.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{guster is lapping up the dinner, bread and all as sam calls out again. in a bit of a panic, sam runs from the cliff.}
