<A>__{vaughan now leaps to his feet, hands raised in triumph. seagrave stirs behind the wheel, then raises his hands. trask emerges from the woods, waving to the now supercharged crowd. seagrave tries to get out of the collapsed porsche but is jammed behind the wheel. without missing a beat, vaughan dances over to the car and begins to haul seagrave out of his seat.}
