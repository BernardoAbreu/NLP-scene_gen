<L>__{interior dr. phil parsons' office day}
<A>__{parsons on the phone, gestures for them to enter.}
<C>__{parsons}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{dorothy, i can't discuss this now }
<P>__{(motions for them to sit)}
<D>__{i'm not taking it lightly, no. we will talk about it at home.}
<A>__{miranda and pete sit across from him. miranda trying hard to appear composed acutely aware of her every gesture, and of how different her last visit to this office was. nothing casual about it now. she stares at the picture frames on phil's desk (all facing away from us), the diplomas on the wall, the books by noted fathers of neurology (works by hughlings jackson, kurt goldstein, henry head, a.r. luria). a framed quote reads: "'if you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest.' wittgenstein"}
<C>__{parsons}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes, dear. me too.}
<A>__{he hangs up. takes a moment to look at miranda. tries a smile but to her it comes off condescending. fact is there's nothing to smile about.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{i'm so sorry about this, miranda.}
<A>__{she nods, dazed. angles her head to look at a framed picture on his desk. parsons looks to pete.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{has pete told you about the hearing?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{teddy already filled her in.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{teddy howard is top notch. he's going to do everything in his power and he's quite resourceful to prove you're not fit to stand trial. miranda, i know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we }
<A>__{push in on miranda who stares intently at something on the desk. not listening to a word he's saying }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{who is that?}
<A>__{parsons pauses here. exchanges glances with pete.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{the girl in the picture.}
<A>__{we see what she is talking about: a framed photograph on the desk is now facing us. eerie. it shows parsons, his wife dorothy and a young girl. our teenage girl.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{my daughter.}
<A>__{miranda looks up at this, perplexed.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{she's the girl i saw.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{you're obviously mistaken.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm positive. she was hurt, bleeding. is she all right?}
<A>__{pete and parsons trade uneasy looks.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{miranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office. you're just confused }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{not about this. is she all right?}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{no, she's not... all right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rachel committed suicide six years ago.}
<A>__{this shuts miranda right up. mind spinning.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{miranda, that's none of your }
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<P>__{(to miranda)}
<D>__{rachel was a very troubled girl. handicapped since birth. she was born mute. my wife and i tried everything to help her fit in but... but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and she finally succeeded. jumped off ashley bridge. she was only seventeen years old.}
<A>__{ashley bridge. mute. ghost? miranda hesitates here. she is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm i'm terribly sorry, phil.}
<A>__{parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore. rises.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{peter, can i speak to you?}
<A>__{the men step outside. push in on miranda's face as she stares at the picture of rachel. we catch snippets of the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her paranoia }
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{... textbook psychotic pattern... manifestation of guilt...}
<C>__{parsons }
<D>__{... much she knows about rachel?}
<C>__{pete }
