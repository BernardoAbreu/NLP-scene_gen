<L>__{exterior haul road the turtle night}
<A>__{the storm has passed. a faint chugging emanates from the small orange generator trailer behind the turtle. eric pulls up and parks the scout.}
<L>__{interior the turtle}
<A>__{nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds eric's research equipment and anne marie's photographic supplies. in one corner of the turtle are several of her black and white prints. all are of man made objects whose presence is juxtaposed with the natural surroundings. relieved he's home in one piece, anne marie meets eric at the door and kisses him. carrying a brown paper wrapped package, eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's preparing dinner.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{did you catch corbett?}

<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{was there any trouble?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, eric.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{can't help myself. corbett's type always pisses me off.}
<P>__{(hands her the package)}
<D>__{oh, i found this at the post office. had your name on it.}
<A>__{perplexed, she looks at the return address bloomingdale's. delighted, she tears it open. inside is a pretty, elegant dress. anne marie kisses him.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{oh, sweetheart. it's beautiful!}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you were looking at it in the catalog. don't know where you can wear it...}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{i will wear it for you. and i can wear it when we go home. we won't be here forever.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{you make it sound like a prison sentence.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{that's not what i meant.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it's exactly what you meant.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{look, why get into this again. as long as it's working, let's leave it alone. it's been nice so far. we're together }
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ permanently?}
<C>__{anne marie}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{do i want to be with you permanently? yes, i think i do. but be with what you do and the way you live? that i don't know. c'mon, eric, until i met you, coming back to alaska was totally out of the question for me. but i'm here. i'm getting great pictures, and i'm having fun.}
<P>__{(slips her arms around him)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{so shut up and let's eat.}
