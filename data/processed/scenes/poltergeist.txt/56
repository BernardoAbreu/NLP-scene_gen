<L>__{interior children’s bedroom night}
<A>__{robbie is watching the tree. carol anne is asleep but she’s tossing and moaning like the wind outside the window. another flash of lightning. robbie pulls the covers up over his nose and mouth. his little breath pushing the fabric up and down as he counts.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{one... two...}
<A>__{ka boom! the room vibrates and robbie takes his eyes off the window for just a moment, looking at the open bedroom door and the light down the hall from his parent’s room. he could be out of bed and there in six seconds if he hurried.}
<B>__{a savage crack of lightning. the explosion of thunder right on top of it.}
<A>__{robbie snaps a look at the window just in time to see it happen.}
