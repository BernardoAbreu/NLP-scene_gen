<L>__{interior charlie's apartment day}
<A>__{charlie lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment. each room is painted a different pastel color. it is furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on the wall and various knick knacks around the rooms it is evident that this is a family apartment rather than a bachelors pad. charlie is helping his mother pack a suitcase. through out the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on camera. the camera pans following his movements and charlie directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond it.}
