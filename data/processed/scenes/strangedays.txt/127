<A>__{lenny and mace approach his bmw, blocked in by ten other cars, so he's not getting it back this trip. he unlocks the door and looks inside with a tiny mag lite while mace covers them with the tazer. a puppy like whine comes occasionally from behind some cars nearby. we catch a glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling rottweiller eyeing them warily. lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side, still wrapped in the note. he reads the note: "help me. iris."}
