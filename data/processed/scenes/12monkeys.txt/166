<L>__{interior men's room airport day}
<A>__{the p.a. drones as ccle, head down, lingers at a sink, washing and rewashing his hands while another traveler finishes drying his hands, gives cole a quizzical look, then leaves. quickly, cole glances around, checks the seemingly empty men's room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly against his face as he leans close to the mirror.}
<C>__{raspy voice }
<D>__{got yourself a prob, bob?}
<A>__{cole whirls, looks for the source of the voice. nothing! until he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an occupied stall. it must be him!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{leave me alone! i made a report. i didn't have to do that.}
<C>__{raspy voice }
<D>__{point of fact you don't belong here. it's not permitted to let you stay.}
<A>__{a toilet flushes in the "occupied" stall. cole's answer is loud and defiant.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{this is the present. this is not the past. this is not the future. this is right now!}
<A>__{a plump businessman emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives cole a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i'm staying here! you got that? you can't stop me!}
<C>__{plump man}
<P>__{(high pitched voice)}
<D>__{anything you say, chief. it's none of my business.}
<A>__{cole looks dismayed. this guy couldn't be "the voice"! and there are no feet showing under the other stalls. did he imagine it?}
