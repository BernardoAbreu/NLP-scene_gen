<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{in the hotel lobby, a maid is cleaning and dusting, and at the same time, singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune. the hotel manager, who is busy writing something in the register behind the desk, looks up and says:}
<C>__{hotel manager}
<D>__{go ahead, keep right on singing...}
<A>__{disappointed, the maid immediately stops singing, and the manager resumes writing. but she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down the stairs. it is claudia.}
<C>__{hotel manager}
<P>__{(to claudia)}
<D>__{excuse me for interfering, but i've heard about that girl... here in this place one gets to know about everything... that girl you're looking for... why don't you try asking at the youth hostel in pergusa? almost all the young girls traveling through here end up there.}
<A>__{claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to ask for additional information. but she is suddenly distracted by sandro who enters the lobby at that very moment.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i was just coming out to meet you. how come you're back so soon?}
<A>__{sandro doesn't answer but merely shrugs his shoulders. then he takes claudia by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway. he has a worried expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing the stairs. as they walk through the corridor, claudia looks at him anxiously, wondering what is wrong.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro ...what's the matter?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he opens the door to his room and ushers claudia in. as soon as he enters, he takes off his jacket and throws it on a chair. then he walks over to the window and closes the shutters. then, without saying a word, he turns to claudia, grabs her in his arms and squeezes her. claudia smiles, and playfully yells "ouch!" then he goes to kiss her but claudia tries to resist but doesn't succeed. this little struggle stimulates sandro and is enough to make him forget all reserve. he drags claudia on to the bed and forces her to lie down.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, sandro... please...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no reason why...}
<A>__{but sandro hugs her and kisses her again. this time, claudia lets herself be kissed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{sandro only responds by kissing her again. then claudia yields. sandro is angry and excited, as though he wanted to take his resentment out on claudia.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... you seem like an entirely different person ...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and aren't you pleased?... that way you'll have a new kind of adventure.}
<A>__{wounded, claudia pushes him away with all her might, and exclaims:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i was only joking, really... can't i make a joke? and now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh, sandro... i want everything you do. but...}
<A>__{she stops short, then turns aside and reaches out to touch his jacket on the chair, looking into the pockets, not with curiosity but with a sense of love. sandro grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to turn around.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but what?}
<A>__{claudia remains silent, then gets up from the bed, and in a subdued tone of voice, says:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes, she started to but i didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. if we had to listen to everybody...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, sandro... we should go. besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. not even with anna's father. we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i don't doubt it. but at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. and as far as telephoning him... who knows where he is?}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence, then claudia starts heading towards the door.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{come, let's go. pack your things, and i will get mine ready too.}
