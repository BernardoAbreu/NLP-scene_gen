<L>__{interior blues club night}
<A>__{fred chatman, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. he's good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by the twenty something patrons. most of them are more interested in a baseball game showing on a big screen tv.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i can't believe these people! they could at least turn off their stupid sports game until he's done playing!}
<A>__{fred finishes to polite applause. an m.c. takes the mic.}
<C>__{m.c.}
<D>__{let's hear it for fred chatman.}
<P>__{(a little more applause)}
<D>__{hey don't go away because we've got blueshammer coming up in just a minute!}
<A>__{a cute girl, mid 20's, stands near their table sipping her drink. enid nods in her direction for seymour's benefit as if to say, "check it out."}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yes, that would certainly do...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well, offer her a seat! you want me to do it?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{wait a minute! hang on! jesus, i gotta think of something to talk to her about. no! no...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{just wait here.}
<A>__{enid gets up before seymour can stop her and talks to cute girl who looks back at seymour and smiles. she goes to join him. enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving seymour a "thumbs up."}
<C>__{cute girl}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{hello. uh... that was great music, huh?}
<C>__{cute girl}
<P>__{(sitting down)}
<D>__{yeah, i just love blues.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{actually, technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the "ragtime" idiom. although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical ragtime piano music like that of scott joplin or joseph lamb. authentic blues has a more conventional twelve bar structure in its stanzas.}
<C>__{cute girl}
<D>__{oh if you like authentic blues, you've just gotta see blueshammer! they're so great!}
<A>__{angle on: enid standing alone at the bar. we see seymour and cute girl from her pov. her gaze drifts to the other people in the bar. we move over the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny, introverted looking guy with a pool cue. he makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine. her gaze drifts on. she sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair. she reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. this is interrupted by blueshammer taking the stage. young, white, cocky, pretty boys.}
<C>__{lance}
<P>__{(lead singer)}
<D>__{all right people! are you ready to boogie? cuz we gwine play you some authentic, way down in the delta blues to rock your world! one, two, three...}
<A>__{a din of loud noise. cute girl immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music. several horny alpha males press in on seymour (who's still sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her. seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward the bar where enid sits.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what did you tell that girl?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{jesus...}
