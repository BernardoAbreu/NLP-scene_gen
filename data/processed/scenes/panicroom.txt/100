<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{out in the bedroom, it's worse for burnham, who has lost most of his hair and shirt. but his skin isn't badly burned, which is something, i guess. still, he's in a rage. he pounds the metal door of the panic room.}

<D>__{i'm coming in there, bitch, i am coming in there! i am coming in there!}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg whirls, goes to the door herself, screams right back. we can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds threatening. suddenly, she stops, hearing something else. outside the door, burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound, a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall that's shared with the brownstone next door. it's a faint very faint pounding sound, along with a high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be heard. sarah hears it too.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{neighbor!}
<A>__{meg and sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, shouting at the tops of their lungs get help, call the police, please, call the police, that sort of thing. they shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if their voices are as soft on the other side as the complaining voice is on this side, they have no hope. their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by the gas to shout for very long. long after they stop, the soft pounding from next door continues. their pleas are not heard.}
