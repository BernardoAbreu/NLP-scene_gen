<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{castle night now comes the moon riding over the horizon. upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light. queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate. heavy vines are climbing up the walls. the castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft. flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane. inside, the corridors are dark and silent. under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads.}
<B>__{hodge}
<A>__{a sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. a flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed. he is snoring gently.}
<B>__{conjuring room}
<A>__{this circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. an iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. in the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for a magical deed. feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor. a scroll is consulted; up comes an arm and a voice blurts out:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{omnia in duos: duo in unum: unus in nihil: haec nec quattuor nec omnia nec duo nec unus nec nihil sunt.}
<A>__{nothing happens.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{come on, candles, out!}
<A>__{but the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{in volunta divina et verbum magi: lux! exstinguat!}
<A>__{it's no use. there is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light. revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of galen bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.}
<B>__{tower}
<A>__{carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular staircase.}
<B>__{turret}
<A>__{the highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the stars and the night air. here, more magic is afoot. an old enchanter, ulrich, magister ipsissimus, pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl. as the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. all at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears. lights and shadows, reflected from within the basin, play across his face. his frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water draco draconis suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl. at that moment galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{vide, magister. there's something wrong.}
<A>__{ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student. galen is taken aback by the old man's grim countenance.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what's the matter? what's happened?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i've just seen something. something of consequence to you.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{to me?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{yes. my own death.}
<A>__{with a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish themselves.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{perhaps we had better hasten your training.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{barnyard day outside the castle wall hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks. he straightens up and squints through the early morning mists. on a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods.}
<B>__{ulrich and galen}
<A>__{hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(stern and troubled)}
<D>__{this wood, these leaves, the birds, the very dome of heaven, once they all rang with one great chord: and philosophers like me kept it all in tune. now, new voices are singing new songs.}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{have you mastered the threefold transmutation?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{well, almost.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{it's very difficult. have you committed to memory undying the codex de profundis?}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(a shrug)}
<D>__{the first two chapters.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{it's long. and what about the ritual of banishment as prescribed by my late master balisarius?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{to tell the truth, i haven't dared try it. what's the point, anyway?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{the point? the point is you don't know it, and you're no magician without it. it was my hope to school you, to mold your faculties and wits... i still believe you have some talent. somewhere.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i hate books. i hate drill. i want a real task.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{there's no time now. when i'm gone, half the powers in the universe will vanish with me. and what's the use of a few lingering skills if they're left in the hands of a child?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{listen!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<A>__{ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision. reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it. he drapes it around galen's neck.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{here, wear this.}
<A>__{galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. he cocks an ear.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{voices, singing on the road.}
<A>__{he hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. ulrich does not follow. instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the ground. awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i don't see anything.}
<A>__{he turns back, but the wizard is gone. a shadow falls over him. he looks up. there, two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind.}
<B>__{airborne}
<A>__{the old conjurer squints into the distance. miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest. they are singing a mournful round.}
<B>__{galen}
<A>__{he gawks skyward. suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(a shout)}
<D>__{we have visitors!}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{rotunda night clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. their leader is a fineboned youth, not yet twenty. like the others, he is uneasy; his name is valerian. hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before them. he leaves without a word. the visitors stare glumly at the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.}
<B>__{conjuring room}
<A>__{galen helps ulrich prepare for the audience. the sorcerer peers at himself in a full length mirror, adjusting the hem of a black robe.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{looks forbidding enough, don't you think?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{here are your sticks.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{no they'll think me infirm. you know, balisarius wore this whenever he changed lead into gold. he could really do that, you know. i never could. too bad you'd stand to inherit some real wealth.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you're in a morbid frame of mind. what's all this about dying? you don't even look sick.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(tying on a sash)}
<D>__{you still wearing that amulet?}
<P>__{(galen nods)}
<D>__{good. don't lose it. it still belongs to me.}
<A>__{he backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto his head.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{now, adeptus minor, get yourself a handful of that sulphurous ash over there...}
<A>__{the sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.}
<B>__{the rotunda}
<A>__{the visitors watch warily as a door swings open and galen makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed together. he looks rather young to be the famous ulrich. galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. ka whump! and ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky fireball. alarmed, the visitors retreat.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{nunc habeus lux!}
<A>__{pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{et calor!}
<A>__{in the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. ulrich totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward the warmth.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{welcome to cragganmore. i am ulrich. which one of you calls himself valerian?}
<A>__{the travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's performance. the young leader of the party screws up his courage and speaks.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{that would be me. we are here on behalf...}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i know why you're here. you're a delegation from urland, from beyond dalvatia. let's see the artifacts.}
<A>__{the travelers exchange nervous glances. valerian motions to one of his companions. the man steps forward and hands over a leather pouch. one by one, valerian places the contents on the table for ulrich's inspection.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{a bone. scorched. a rock, fire blackened.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{scales.}
<A>__{at this, ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering irridescent disks as big as saucers.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{all right. how did you come by these?}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{i found them. at the mouth of the lair.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears to be a curved sword. he jabs it into the table.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{a claw.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{that's no claw. it's a tooth. by the gods!}
<A>__{he runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at his visitors.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{and you want me to do battle with that?}
<A>__{valerian has lost all trace of timidity.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{who else can we turn to? we all know what we're dealing with here. this is a basilicok.}
<P>__{(he takes a step forward)}
<D>__{a cockatrice.}
<P>__{(another step, bolder)}
<D>__{a dragon.}
<P>__{(he leans close to ulrich)}
<D>__{this is no stag, no bear, no natural creature. this is one of your kind. and only a necromancer such as yourself can rid us of it.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{did you try the meredydd sisters? what about rinbod? i've heard it said he killed a dragon once.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{they're all dead. you're the only one left.}
<A>__{with a sigh, ulrich lowers himself into a chair. he rubs his withered legs and shakes his head.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{it's a long way to urland.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{every quarter, upon the solstices and the equinoxes there's a new victim.}
<A>__{greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{my daughter, for one.}
<C>__{other travelers}
<D>__{my sister... cousins...}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{all women?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{girls. virgins, to be exact, chosen by lot.}
<A>__{galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and tooth.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{master, don't you think }
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{silence!}
<A>__{he broods for a long time.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{are you afraid of dragons?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{no. sorcerers and dragons go back a long long time together. if it weren't for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any dragons.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right. i will go.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{courtyard day the travelers are making ready for departure in the grey light of dawn. as hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box, ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i know of this dragon. vermithrax pejorative: she's four hundred years old. as far as i can tell she's the last of her kind. very appropriate that i'm the one to finish her off, don't you think?}
<P>__{(he tries out the crutches)}
<D>__{there. flatten the highest mountain. what say you, galen?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{speak up.}
<P>__{(still no answer)}
<D>__{you, hodge.}
<A>__{hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(to galen)}
<D>__{while i'm gone see you keep your nose in your books and your hands out of my reagents. leave my instruments alone too.}
<A>__{galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master sullenly.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{look at yourself. how far will you get like that? a league, two leagues?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i'm not worried about the road.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{why don't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach and four?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{don't mock me.}
<A>__{galen gets up and calls out to the urlanders.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you pilgrims: you're used to lotteries. why not draw straws to see who'll be first to carry ironshanks here.}
<A>__{this is too much for hodge.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{hold your tongue. if the master's got a mind to go, he'll go.}
<A>__{galen approaches the old sorcerer.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{send me. you're always saying i need seasoning. i need a test. let me go.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{you're not ready.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i'm ready for anything.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(wan smile)}
<D>__{don't be so hasty. your time will come.}
<A>__{the walkers are ready to set forth. hodge picks up his pack, steps forward and pulls open the great gate.}
<B>__{horsemen}
<A>__{three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their shoulders. they look formidable. the urlanders take a step backward.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{tyrian!?}
<A>__{tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. there is a coat of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<P>__{(amiable)}
<D>__{good morning, all.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{we're not afraid of you. give us the road.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{why, the road is yours. all the way to urland. it's a long journey, isn't it? but when you're in search of a sorcerer, i suppose no distance is too great.}
<A>__{sensing trouble, galen moves forward. ulrich touches his arm.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{say nothing.}
<A>__{galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys. hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{what do you want with us?}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{well, like my good friends here, i've come for a bit of black magic. no doubt you've heard of our troubles at home. this is cragganmore, is it not?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{aye, this be the place of ulrich.}
<A>__{tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{and here we have the mystical presence himself, no?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{you'd best keep your distance and your manners.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{if he's ready to lay a dragon in its grave, he's got nothing to fear from me.}
<P>__{(turns to the urlanders)}
<D>__{i've no more love for that creature than you lot. nor has the king. but, before you stir things up, don't you think it a good idea to see you've got the right man for the job?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{aha it's a test you're looking for. we don't do tests.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{i'm sure you don't. they never do tests and not many real deeds either. oh, conversation with your grandmother's shade in a darkened room, the odd love potion or two... but comes a doubter, well then, it's the wrong day, the planets are not aligned, the entrails aren't favorable, we don't do tests.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{we've got no doubts. we require no test.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{and you're not going to get one.}
<A>__{when ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and authoritative.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(to galen)}
<D>__{go to the conjuring room. the iron box. fetch me the dagger within.}
<A>__{galen's eyes widen with alarm.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{the dagger. be quick.}
<A>__{galen dashes into the castle. ulrich gazes almost shyly at tyrian.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{you shall have your test.}
<B>__{conjuring room}
<A>__{galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and flings it open. amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a professional magician is an ivory handled dagger covered with runic inscriptions. galen eagerly examines it to see how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle, but it is all too genuine. a murder weapon.}
<C>__{ulrich's voice}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{where are you, boy? i'm waiting.}
<A>__{galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard. he displays the dagger.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{not this one, was it?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{the very one. let it fall.}
<A>__{galen hesitates, then tosses it. tumbling end over end, it arcs downward. the old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand and plucks it neatly out of the air. galen watches as ulrich passes the weapon to tyrian and strips back his robe exposing a bony chest. galen knows what's coming. he rushes for the door. he's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own accord. he sprints for a second exit. whack! this door slams shut too. locked in. quick, back to the window and climb down the vine... smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.}
<B>__{ulrich and tyrian}
<A>__{ulrich takes tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger to his breastbone.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{vita regula, vita hieratica!}
<A>__{everyone is filled with dread. hodge is shaking. from the castle come the rattling of shutters and galen's muffled cries. a sick sarcastic smile has crept over tyrian's lips. he tenses himself to thrust.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{go on. don't worry, you can't hurt me.}
<B>__{conjuring room}
<A>__{galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the shutter. below he can see the participants in this grisly drama. he holds his breath. tyrian makes a sudden movement and buries the blade in ulrich's chest. but the sorcerer stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. then, after a long moment, he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that holds it. tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in a heap. very quickly he remounts. in another moment he and his companions are gone. the others are riveted in horror. hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief. galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the gloomy conjuring room. click! the doors unlatch themselves and swing open.}

<A>__{funeral pyre day ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, reposes on a hardwood pyre. his hands are folded on his chest. his face is peaceful. while the visitors wordlessly look on, galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. at first the fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an unearthly roar. the onlookers back away from the intense heat.}

<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping ashes and small bones into a leather pouch the remains of ulrich. up behind him comes galen, now clad in a traveler's cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.}
