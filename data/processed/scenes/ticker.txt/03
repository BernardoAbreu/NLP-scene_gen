<L>__{interior building night}
<A>__{a huge, old, battered machine shop. spooky darkness, dead quiet. moonlight filters in through dirt smeared windows. the door creaks as reilly and rice slip in, stop, eyes scan. nothing. just rows of glistening machines. rice gestures for reilly to spread out. they head in, footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them. still nothing...deeper, deeper... then, glancing over, reilly sees a shape hiding behind a machine. he steps towards it. the shape whirls a beautiful spitfire of a girl with piercing blue eyes. she tries to bolt. reilly grabs her. she struggles, pulls a knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{ow! son of a bitch.}
<A>__{he punches her full force in the face she collapses, knocked out cold. rice rushes over.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{yeah, just a nick ...}
<A>__{then, over reilly's shoulder, rice sees a dark silhouette emerging from behind a machine. rice draws his pistol.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{freeze! police!}
<A>__{as reilly whirls, the silhouette raises a mac 11. rice shoves reilly aside as the silhouette opens fire... diving for cover, reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips out his 9mm and returns fire at the silhouette, blowing the shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines. silence for an instant, reilly looks for rice and finds him bleeding to death on the floor nearby he is completely exposed to the line of fire. the silhouette and another figure open fire on reilly. swan, 40s, crazy brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men, pale, sweaty, wearing an earring, 30s, continue the barrage. swan fires one shot at a time at rice, deliberately aiming not to kill him, trying to flush reilly out. rice screams as bullets rip into his legs. reilly tries to reach him but can't, shots forcing him back. a dark eyed man with a beard appears in the b.g. and stealths towards reilly from behind. reilly' face is in agony as rice moans in pain. he glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to the girl lying next to him what's keeping them there? obviously the girl. she stirs. desperate, reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves his 9mm to her head. using her as a shield, he drags her in front of rice to protect him.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(to gunmen)}
<D>__{drop it!}
<A>__{swan's eyes flare. he steps out into the open, gun aimed at rice, eyes locked murderously on reilly.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{let her go.}
<A>__{reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling. the girl stiffens, terrified. beard emerges behind reilly. deadly silent, he raises an automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines...}
<C>__{swan }
<D>__{no, the girl!}
<A>__{reilly whirls, sees beard, shrinks back to stay covered.}
<C>__{earring}
<P>__{(to swan)}
<D>__{we gotta get outta here!}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(to swan)}
<D>__{tell them to drop it now!}
<A>__{a deadly stalemate. faraway sirens wail.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{you have no idea how sorry you're going to be.}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{beard smolders, earring sweats. keeping their guns up, the three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door and slip out. the moment they're gone, reilly quickly handcuffs the girl to a machine, kneels, cradles rice.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{mike...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{don't talk.}
<C>__{rice}
<D>__{take your time... one day at a time, kid...}
<A>__{rice takes reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch.}
<C>__{rice }
<D>__{it's all i got... it's yours.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{it don't work }
<C>__{rice}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{ain't that a shit }
<A>__{rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath. reilly winces, eyes welling up. his gaze moves at the girl. the girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior ...}
