<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior vulcan family home dusk}
<A>__{the image is spectacular, aglow in dusk light: a beautiful baby, just born, held in a woman's hands. it is being cleaned; warm water runs down its face and body. tight on the midwife (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the baby as it cries. another, younger, midwife can be seen behind her, assisting with the pitchers of water. as she cleans the baby, she says to someone off camera:}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{he is strong.}
<A>__{the baby, now calm, gets swaddled. he is then gently held out to the new mother: amanda grayson, late 20's. an original beauty. she lies on a divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. she tenderly takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized. she holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{... hello.}
<A>__{close on the younger midwife, standing at the rear of the room. she raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:}
<C>__{younger midwife}
<D>__{the baby is healthy. why does she cry?}
<C>__{midwife}
<P>__{(a beat; then)}
<D>__{she is human.}
<A>__{a distant, quiet buzz and the elder midwife stands, looking into the distance. and this is when we see, for the first time, that the midwife has pointed ears.}
<C>__{midwife }

<L>__{exterior vulcan home dusk}
<A>__{sarek (late 40's, a vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home. he moves to amanda and kneels. he looks at the child his child and says:}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{well done.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly with just enough rancor:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he regards her. knows he's in trouble }
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{your tone suggests disappointment. the science council required my presence for a session regarding }
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{don't do that. you knew i wanted you here.}
<A>__{the vulcan midwives share a look. sarek glances at them. nods. the two women excuse themselves. sarek reaches over, touches a small touchpad the harpsichord music stops. he says, clinically:}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{as you are aware, the vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{well traditionally, i'm not the one giving birth.}
<P>__{(then)}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{i moved here to another planet to be with you. i needed you to be with me today. holding my hand and telling me i'm doing great, even when i'm just... breathing the best i can.}
<A>__{sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at the baby finding comfort in his innocence. sarek considers this. he moves closer to her. whispers intimately:}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{you are correct. i should have been here. i am sorry.}
<A>__{and with her free hand, she pulls sarek closer and kisses him. and the two look at the baby.}
<C>__{sarek }
<D>__{i had a thought. that we might name the child after one of our respected early society builders. his name was "spock".}
<A>__{she looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.}
<C>__{sarek }
<D>__{your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{no... spock.}
<P>__{(smiles, touches his face)}
<D>__{... spock.}
<A>__{she looks at sarek: spock it is.}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{the child has your eyes.}
<A>__{she pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears. she gently rubs the top of his right ear and it unfurls, revealing a small, soft pointed vulcan ear.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{... and your ears.}
<A>__{and off the image of this tiny baby, half human, half vulcan, we... fade out: . and over blackness, we begin to hear an alarm sounding growing and the super "three years later" appears and finally the blackness is split by turbo lift doors opening and we reveal that we're on:}
