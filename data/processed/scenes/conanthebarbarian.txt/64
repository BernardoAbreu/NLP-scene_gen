<L>__{exterior bridge to nowhere night}
<A>__{conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of rabbits he's hunted and skinned. he looks around, surprised not to find tamara. he hears a yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the clearing.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far, muddying and scraping herself all along the way. she lets out a frustrated grunt as conan simply picks her back up and carries her back to the outcropping. he pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at her feet.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{here. eat.}
<A>__{tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{couldn't you at least cook it first?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{fire draws attention.}
<A>__{conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{does it bother you, blood on your hands?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{the only blood on these hands i claimed with my own sword.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{clean hands mean nothing. kings and queens claim more lives than i will ever meet, and not a drop is spilled in their presence.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i've done no harm to you. i've done no harm to anyone.}
<A>__{conan confronts her, enraged.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you lie. you are the very reason my people are dead.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{are you mad? i never met your people.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{but khalar singh has. he destroyed my people, looking for you.}
<A>__{suddenly tamara understands.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{the one who came for us? his name is khalar singh?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you know this.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{we did not know who sought us, only that we were sought.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you hid from him. and while you did, others died in your place.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{if we did not hide, countless more would have been killed! you do not know what purpose he has for our queen.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{and i do not care, for he will not live to see it bear fruit!}
<A>__{tamara is shocked.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{wait you seek to kill this khalar? we have the same aim. he takes my queen to khor kalba. i have sworn an oath to protect her. i can help you.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{enough lies.}
<A>__{conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.}
