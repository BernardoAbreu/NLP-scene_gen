<A>__{under the dazzling neon light of the nypd coroner's premises, amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation. she is interrupted by somebody who enters the room there is someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her urgently. amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves, and exits the autopsy room. we follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital. the atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department. there is no doubt we are in new york city. coroner's office lobby continuous amy comes to the reception desk. ben, who clearly hasn't slept since the night before, is pacing back and forth.}
