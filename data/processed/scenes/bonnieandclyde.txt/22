<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior roadside cafe. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde seated in booth, now c.u. clyde. the sound track bridges the scene: the question that bonnie has just asked is now suddenly rebutted by clyde, as he points a finger at her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(not answering her,}
<D>__{preferring to lead}
<P>__{the conversation)}
<D>__{i will tell you about you.}
<A>__{he loves doing this and he does it well. the more he envisions bonnie's life, the more instinctively accurate he becomes. she grows more and more fascinated, like a child watching a mind reader.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{lessee...you were born somewheres around east texas...got a big old family, right?...you went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much 'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway. so you just quit. now...}
<P>__{(thinking, playing it for all it's worth)}
<D>__{...when you were sixteen...no, seventeen, there was a guy who worked in...uh...}
<A>__{pull back taking in bonnie, favoring clyde.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(fascinated)}
<D>__{cement plant }
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{right. cement plant. and you liked him 'cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be. you almost married that guy, but then...you thought, no, you didn't think you would. so you got your job in the cafe...}
<P>__{(getting closer to}
<D>__{home now, hitting}
<P>__{them right in there)}
<D>__{and every morning you wake up and you hate it. you just hate it. and you get down there and you put on your white uniform }
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(enthralled)}
<D>__{pink.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{and the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it...and they ask you for dates and sometimes you go...but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not...and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will i ever get away from this?...and now you know.}
<A>__{bonnie is half mesmerized by his talk. a waitress comes with their food. a cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on each temple in the style of the times. clyde looks at her and at bonnie, who also wears spit curls. as soon as the waitress leaves:}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(pointing at her hair)}
<D>__{change that. i don't like it.}
<A>__{without a word of protest, bonnie immediately reaches in her bag and takes out a mirror. she holds it up and with the other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair. she never again wears them. when she has pushed them back she looks at clyde for his approval. he nods his okay. she smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food. she's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on her plate. clyde doesn't touch his food, just watches bonnie eat for a minute.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{god, you're a knockout.}
