<A>__{marion and gabriel ride past the signs of a small skirmish. bodies. abandoned wagons. dead horses. a burning farm.}
<L>__{exterior camden hillside day}
<A>__{marion and gabriel ride to the crest of a hill. a vista spreads out before them. they see an awesome sight a massive slash of red approaches a massive slash of blue. a battle is taking place about five miles away. gabriel starts to spur his horse but marion restrains him.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no, it's too late.}
<A>__{gabriel stops. marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{command posts... patriot... british...}
<A>__{the distant slash of red stops. marion and gabriel hear only a gentle wind and some nearby songbirds. then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a sudden, silent eruption of white smoke. an instant later, the blue slash quivers. a moment later the sound of the cannons, rumbles up the hill and rolls over marion and gabriel. the red slash stops moving. it darkens as thousands of redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position. marion's eyes dart. he knows what's coming.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{break for the trees... break for the trees...}
<A>__{a massive eruption of white smoke billows from the red slash. an instant later, the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant patriots fall. the sound of the british muskets reaches marion and gabriel like the pattering of rain. then the smoke of ineffective, scattered volleys erupts from the patriot lines. the red line holds firm.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{send them to cover! goddamn you!}
<A>__{but the blue line of the patriots stays in the open field. from behind the redcoats, fast moving green and red masses move quickly onto the battlefield. cavalry.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father, we have to do something...}
<A>__{the british cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it. tiny bits of blue move in every direction.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's already over.}
<A>__{marion watches, appalled. at this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful. marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the patriot lines.}
