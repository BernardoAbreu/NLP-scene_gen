<L>__{interior east wing guest suite night}
<A>__{an enormous bedroom, filled with 18th century antique furniture. dr. robert allenby dabs chance's ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. chance stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television which is not turned on.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{the injection will ease the pain and swelling, mr. gardiner.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i understand. i've seen it done before.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{now, you'll barely feel this. it won't hurt at all.}
<A>__{allenby administers the injection, chance reacts from the pain.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{you were wrong, it did hurt.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(a chuckle)}
<D>__{but not for long...}
<A>__{as allenby puts a band aid on chance's ass, chance spots a remote control for the tv on the bedside table. he reaches out, picks it up.}
<C>__{allenby }
<D>__{it's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i think so, too.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{however, with injuries such as this, i have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{chance turns on the tv.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(a look to the tv, then to chance)}
<D>__{you can pull your trousers up, now.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{oh, fine.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(as chance pulls up pants)}
<D>__{just to take the proper precautions, mr. gardiner, i'd recommend we take you downstairs and x ray your leg.}
<P>__{(no reaction from chance,}
<D>__{allenby takes a long look}
<P>__{at him)}
<D>__{... by the way, mr. gardiner, i would like to ask you something straight out.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(doesn't understand)}
<D>__{... straight out?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{yes. are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand's?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{claim...? ... oh, claim, that's what thomas asked me.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{thomas? who's thomas?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{thomas franklin, an attorney.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{an attorney?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(turns back to tv)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(suddenly very cold)}
<D>__{then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{there's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(gives chance a look)}
<D>__{oh, i see...}
<P>__{(warms up)}
<D>__{... well, then... you're a very funny man, mr. gardiner. you caught me off guard, i must admit...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(changes channels, sits on bed)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{good, keep your weight off that leg, mr. gardiner. in fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. i can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, i could stay here. thank you.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{fine. would you like me to speak to your personal physician?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{allenby waits for chance to say more, he does not. finally, allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(stops by door)}
<D>__{i will send wilson up to take you for x rays, mr. gardiner. feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(clicking changer)}
<D>__{yes, i will.}
<A>__{allenby gives him a look, then leaves. chance watches an old movie of a man lighting a cigar. the man enjoys the cigar, blows out smoke. the scene seems to 'sink into' chance's mind.}
