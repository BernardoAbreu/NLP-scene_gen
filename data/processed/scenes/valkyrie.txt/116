<L>__{exterior airfield rastenburg day}
<A>__{titles: 1:15 pm. stauffenberg and haeften climb aboard a waiting plane. a beat later it is rolling down the runway.}
<C>__{mertz }
<D>__{every second we stand here arguing is a second lost.}
<L>__{interior war ministry olbricht's office day}
<A>__{olbricht is calm in full denial. he straightens his tie in the mirror as mertz paces the room, flustered.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i can't initiate valkyrie without confirmation that hitler's dead. it's too great a risk.}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{what about stauffenberg? what about his risk? he did his part and now you're abandoning him.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{watch yourself, colonel.}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{shouldn't you be consulting beck?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i know just what beck will say. he's a dying man. what does he have to lose?}
<A>__{he puts on his hat and coat now, turning to leave.}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{at least put the reserve army on alert.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i can't cover up another false alarm. when stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation. then we'll proceed.}
<A>__{mertz is speechless. as olbricht walks out:}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{and where are you going?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{the same place you are. lunch.}
