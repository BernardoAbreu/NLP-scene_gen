<A>__{the place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before. this might be due to the presence of danielle. she sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads. joyce guides her. harvey shuffles into the room. he watches for a moment as joyce and danielle play. angle on joyce: there is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face. he interrupts them.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{hey joyce.}
<A>__{joyce looks up. harvey looks like he's trying to hide something.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what is it harvey?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{that was the doctor.}
<A>__{joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. she hangs on harvey's every word.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{he said i'm all clear.}
<A>__{tears well in harvey's eyes. joyce breathes a sigh of relief and danielle jumps up and runs over to harvey. she hugs him.}
