<L>__{exterior roth's private terrace day}
<A>__{michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that overlooks the city.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{you have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy. it's always been that way, most men frighten easy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we're making a big investment in cuba. that's my only concern.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{my concern is that the three million never arrived at batista's numbered account in switzerland. he thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the money was sent.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{then you have to trace it. michael, people here look at me as a reliable man. i can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man. but you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me. you shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i wouldn't consider anyone else.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{except the president of the united states.}
<A>__{he laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between them. then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully stifles with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{if only i could live to see it, kid; to be there with you. how beautifully we've done it, step by step. here, protected, free to make our profits without the justice department, the fbi; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government. ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be president of the united states, and having the cash to make it possible.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you'll be there to see it; you'll be there.}
