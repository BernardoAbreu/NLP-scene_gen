<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{exterior small public park central texas day}
<B>__{agent scully}
<A>__{she stands against a backdrop of texas flatland, squinting into the sun. shaking her head.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i don't know, mulder...}
<A>__{we are: wide angle reverse, to include mulder, standing in the middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground equipment. all brand spanking new. they are standing right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched and barren little field. where the earthen hole had been dug by the young boys. and what had later been the site of so much activity by the group of scientists. but where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had been.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{he didn't mention a park.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{this is where he marked on the map, scully. where he says those fossils were unearthed.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. not even a sewer or a storm drain.}
<A>__{mulder scans the area, confounded. shaking his head as they walk.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{the bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{and you've never seen anything like that?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{no. it didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests }
<A>__{mulder is listening to all this while looking down at his feet:}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{this looks like new grass to you?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{it looks pretty green for this climate.}
<A>__{mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of turf. he digs around, lifting up a corner of a new square.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{ground's dry about an inch down. somebody just laid this down. very recently, i'd say.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{all the equipment is brand new.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{no irrigation system. somebody's covering their tracks.}
<A>__{they both turn, looking at something that's caught their attention on the street where their rental car is parked. three kids, all of whom we recognize from earlier. stevie's "friends". tooling down the street on new bmx bikes. reacting to mulder's loud whistle. this stops them, staring at mulder blankly across the distance.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{they don't answer. just keep staring, squinting into the sun. mulder and scully start walking toward them.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{do you live around here? 2nd boy yeah.}
<A>__{as the agents approach.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you see anybody digging here?}
<A>__{the kids don't answer quickly.}
<D>__{2nd boy not supposed to talk about it.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{you're not supposed to talk about it? who told you that? 3rd boy nobody.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{nobody. same nobody who put this park in? that new equipment...}
<P>__{(off the boys guilty looks)}
<D>__{they buy you these bikes?}
<A>__{the kids shift uncomfortably.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i think you better tell us. 2nd boy we don't even know you.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{well, we're fbi agents. 2nd boy you're not fbi agents.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how do you know? 2nd boy cause fbi agents wear like suits and goofy ties. and dresses like my mom wears to church. like on that one show.}
<A>__{mulder and scully pull their badges. the kids' mouths drop.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{maybe you've been watching too much tv. 3rd boy they all left twenty minutes ago. 4th boy going that way.}
<A>__{the kids all pointing in the same direction.}
