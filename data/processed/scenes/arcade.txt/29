<L>__{interior manning house, living room night}
<A>__{alex comes down the stairs, heading for the front door. only she stops for a moment...noticing the light. on the couch, her father is once again bathed in the blue light of the television. static whispers, the same as before, are coming from the set. alex looks at her father. he hasn't moved. and yet, the t.v. is on once again.}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{blue static. unexceptional. and a face? someone in the static? alex draws closer to the screen. she can hear something now, other than static whispers. sounds kind of like a voice...}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{a definite, ghostly face is there. it turns, looks at alex (us) and it's greg.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(on screen, strange)}
<D>__{alex...}
<A>__{alex jerks and snaps off the t.v., spooked as hell. she stands in the darkness and all but runs out of the house.}
