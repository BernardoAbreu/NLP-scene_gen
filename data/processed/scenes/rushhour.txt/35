<A>__{sam and joy sit at the table. ambassador han and mrs. han are having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish. ambassador han reads through the morning's faxed communiques. he's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the u.s. he's dressed in an impeccably tailored, valentino two piece suit. mrs. han is slender, soft spoken, but as iron willed as her husband. she, however, is quick to smile. she's wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders. ambassador han pulls the front of sam's shirt to reveal the "nirvana" logo on his t shirt.}
