<L>__{extreme closeup of glowing honey colored stones. their shapes abstract}
<A>__{as the camera examines air bubbles and crystalline patterns. moving up and over this amber abstraction, the camera finds unusual shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone: flecks of dirt, hairs, cracks. still moving. starbursts of light ricochet off the different surfaces of the stones. camera turns along a creamy stretch of amber. it turns in deeper, abstracting the picture further only to find a tiny blur that suddenly racks into focus a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb. it is folded on its back.}
<B>__{slow motion}
<A>__{as the tip of a fine pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug. orange flecks fly. the mosquito trembles. the drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body. a shiny pair of thin needle nose pliers reach in the borehole and extricate the mosquito remains. these are dropped on a brightly lit glass slide. a conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along. arriving under a long lensed microscope. in microscopic perspective, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately removes a fragment of tissue. pincers snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube. the tube spins, faster and faster until it is a blur on the screen. the screen floods with an infra red light. gray, oval shapes rock in a neutral mist.}
