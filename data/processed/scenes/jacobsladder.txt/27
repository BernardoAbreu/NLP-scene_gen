<L>__{interior della's apt. night}
<A>__{we hear loud dance music. sly and the family stone. jacob is with some post office employees at a crowded party in a small apartment. a drunk is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same time. it is constantly on the verge of spilling. jacob is fixated on it. in the background, we see jezzie dancing and motioning for jacob to join her. he nods no. the drunk, who keeps asking people if they "get it," takes jacob's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying to re explain the joke. jacob hears a strange noise and looks around. it seems to be coming from a covered bird cage. he goes over to it and lifts the cover. the bird is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. the sound, loud and insistent, startles him. he lowers the cover. in the dining room, several people are gathered around elsa, an attractive black woman who is reading palms. she sees jacob and calls over the music.}
