<L>__{interior men's room}
<A>__{derek enters. no one else around. he goes to the urinal and begins to unzip. about 30 seconds later he hears the door open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large public men's restroom in the workplace with 4 urinals and 2 stalls. but suddenly, a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his crotch. derek whirls around, face to face with a brazen, smiling lisa who dangles a sprig of mistletoe in her free hand. her eyes flash with desire.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{lisa tries to kiss him. derek resists. he staggers away from the urinal with lisa still holding him.}
<C>__{derek }
<D>__{lisa }
<A>__{they knock open a stall door and fall in. derek goes back against the toilet and lisa is now practically straddling him. d}
<C>__{derek }
<D>__{lisa, stop }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{are you out of your }
<A>__{that's when someone comes in. derek kicks the stall door shut with his foot just in time. he and lisa freeze, pressed close together as a drunk male worker staggers to the urinal and unzips. lisa hides a giggle. derek is horrified they'll be discovered. then... the drunk begins to piss. loudly. and then begins to sing santa claus is coming to town... even more loud. in the stall, lisa and derek are face to face. his hand grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch. he tries to remove it but her grip is like a vice.}
<C>__{derek }
<D>__{for god's }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh, come on...}
<A>__{hearing something, the drunk hesitates in mid piss, looks back over his shoulder.}
<C>__{drunk}
<P>__{(bleary)}
<D>__{hey, who's there?}
<A>__{derek is trapped. lisa gives him a naughty smile. she's in control and enjoying this, turned on by the thrill of getting caught.}
<C>__{drunk }
<D>__{somebody in there?}
<A>__{lisa is about to answer. derek hushes her. when there's no reply, the drunk resumes pissing. lisa smears the mistletoe sprig against derek's face, then starts to go down on him. he clutches her head with both hands forcing her to stop. she looks up at him, eyes gleaming with passion.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{don't do this...}
<A>__{the drunk continues his piss. endless. finally.. finished. he clumsily zips back up, lurches over to the sink. he looks at himself in the mirror, runs his fingers through his hair, smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door. the stall door bangs open as derek pushes lisa aside and staggers out, trying to zip up his fly.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{wait. where are you going?}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{you've got the wrong idea!}
<B>__{a p}
<A>__{lisa doesn't seem to understand but she's amused. derek is already out the door.}
