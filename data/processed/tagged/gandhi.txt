<L>__{exterior sky day}
<A>__{the camera is moving toward an indian city. we are high and far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear: "no man's life can be encompassed in one telling. there is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. what can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man..." and now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large factories... and as we move nearer, coursing over the parched terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images from the life we are seeking: british: "who the hell is he?!", lower class british: "i don't know, sir."... "my name is gandhi. mohandas k. gandhi."... a woman's voice, tender, soft: "you are my best friend, my highest guru... and my sovereign lord."... a man (gandhi): "i am asking you to fight!"... an angry aristocratic english voice: "at home children are writing 'essays' about him!"... the sound of massed rifle fire, screams...}
<L>__{exterior city day}
<A>__{and now we are over the city, coming in toward a particular street in the affluent suburbs of new delhi... there are a few cars (it is 1948), and we are closing on a milling crowd near the entrance to one of the larger homes. we see saris, indian tunics, a sprinkling of "gandhi" caps, several tongas (two wheeled, horse drawn taxis)... the shreds of sound continue american woman, flirtatious, intimate: "you're the only man i know who makes his own clothes." gandhi's laugh... the sound of rioting, women's cries and screams of terror... an american voice: "this man of peace"... and as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the street... an australian and his wife, a bbc correspondent... all in passing, as the camera finally closes and holds on one young man: godse. birla house exterior day godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward an entrance way at the back of a long wall.}
<C>__{house servant's voice}
<D>__{he will be saying prayers in the garden just follow the others.}
<A>__{in contrast to those about him, there is tension in godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. he glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his. two young men (apte and karkare) meet godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger. they descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (prakash) with a short, close cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching... apte and karkare look back at him. there is just the slightest acknowledgment and then prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. the gate at birla house exterior day godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. he stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of prakash. prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. garden birla house exterior twilight a fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark "i see him." "here he comes!" "which one is manu?"... apte and karkare move to different sides of godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. featuring gandhi. we see him distantly through the crowd. the brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, his "walking sticks," manu and abha. we do not see him clearly until the very last moment only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. the camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always godse's, but gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. we hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of apte and karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger. featuring godse. he slides through to the very front rank. his breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. and now, for an instant we see gandhi close from his point of view. he is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and manu half obscures him. godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face then he moves boldly out into gandhi's path, bumping manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands.}

<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{brother bapu is already late for prayers.}
<A>__{ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the mahatma. and now we see gandhi in full shot. the cheap glasses, the nut brown head, the warm, eager eyes. he smiles and joins his hands together to exchange godse's greeting. godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at gandhi loud, startling once, twice... thrice. gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls.}

<B>__{day}
<A>__{commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. we concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished american broadcaster of the time, edward r. murrow, who sits on the makeshift platform, a microphone marked "cbs" before him, describing the procession as technicians and staff move quietly around him.}

<D>__{...the object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived a private man without wealth, without property, without official title or office...}
<A>__{kingsway new delhi exterior day as the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of sikhs, and tamils, anglo indians, moslems from the north, marathas from the south, blue eyed parsees, dark skinned keralans...}
<D>__{murrow's voice over mahatma gandhi was not a commander of great armies nor ruler of vast lands, he could boast no scientific achievements, no artistic gift... yet men, governments and dignitaries from all over the world have joined hands today to pay homage to this little brown man in the loincloth who led his country to freedom...}
<A>__{we see the throng, following the weapon carrier bier of gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the kingsway. mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands... and behind them a broad mass of indians. for a moment we see their sandalled feet moving along the roadway and realize their quiet, rhythmic shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced.}
<D>__{murrow's voice over pope pius, the archbishop of canterbury, president truman, chiang kai shek, the foreign minister of russia, the president of france... are among the millions here and abroad who have lamented his passing. in the words of general george c. marshall, the american secretary of state, "mahatma gandhi had become the spokesman for the conscience of mankind..."}
<A>__{in the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall, english figure of mirabehn, dressed in a sari, her face taut in a grief that seems ready to break like the ganges in flood. near her a tall, heavy set man, germanic, still powerful of build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest a man well into his sixties (kallenbach). he too marches with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for national mourning. on the edge of the street an american newspaperman (walker) watches as the bier passes him. he has been making notes, but his hand stops now and we see the profile of gandhi from his point of view as the weapon carrier silently rolls by. it is personal, close. walker clenches his teeth and there is moisture in his eyes as he looks down. he tries to bring his attention to his pad again, but his heart is not in it and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the horde of passing feet following the bier.}
<D>__{murrow's voice over ...a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than empires." and albert einstein added, "generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."}
<A>__{the camera picks out those who ride on the weapon carrier with gandhi's body... the stout, blunt, but now shattered patel, gandhi's son, devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of maulana azad, now angry at the gods themselves... and finally pandit nehru a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father.}
<D>__{murrow's voice over ... but perhaps to this man of peace, to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate, the tribute he would value most has come from general douglas mcarthur: "if civilization is to survive," the general said this morning, "all men cannot fail to adopt gandhi's belief that the use of force to resolve conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our own self destruction."...}
<A>__{a news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd. as the cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their pictures. there is a newsreel crew center. the camera features a woman photographer (margaret bourke white) who sits with her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous camera held loosely in her hand, un regarded, as she watches the body of gandhi approach. the intelligent features are betrayed by the emotion in her eyes. for an instant we see gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact it has on her.}
<D>__{murrow's voice over perhaps for the rest of us, the most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent new york pm which today wrote, "there is still hope for a world which reacts as reverently as ours has to the death of a man like gandhi."...}
<A>__{the camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear, moving off down the vast esplanade, its narrowing path parting the sea of humanity like a long trail across a weaving plain... and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades in the distance we dissolve through to railroad south africa exterior night with the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out across a darkly verdant plain, and suddenly the whistle of a train as its engine and light sweep under the camera, startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape. tracking with the train. we begin at the guard's van, dwelling for a moment on the words "south african railways," then pass on to the dimly lit third class coaches in the rear of the train, moving past the crowded blacks and indians in the spare wooden accommodation... there are two or three such coaches, then a second class coach... cushioned seats, better lighting, a smattering of europeans: farmers, clerks, young families. their clothes indicate the date: the early 1890s. the conductor is working his way through this coach, checking tickets... the track continues to the first class coach linen over the seats, well lit luxurious compartments. we pass a single european, and then come to rest on the back of a young indian dressed in a rather dandified victorian attire, and reading as a black porter stows his luggage. first class coach south african railways interior }

<A>__{featuring the young indian. it is the young gandhi a full head of hair, a somewhat sensuous face, only the eyes help us to identify him as the man we saw at birla house, the figure on the bier in delhi. he is lost in his book and there is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads intrigues and surprises him. he grins suddenly at some insight, then looks out of the window, weighing the idea. as he does the european passes the compartment and stops dead on seeing an indian face in the first class section. the porter glances at the european nervously. gandhi pivots to the porter, holding his place in the book, missing the european, who has moved on down the corridor, altogether. we see the cover of the book: the kingdom of god is within you, by leo tolstoy.}

<A>__{maritzburg station exterior night gandhi's luggage is thrown onto the station platform. a blast of steam from the engine. a policeman and the conductor are pulling gandhi from the first class car. gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by the door, a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand. the european cracks on gandhi's hands with his fist, breaking gandhi's grip and the policeman and conductor push him across the platform. it is ugly and demeaning. disgustedly, the conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start. gandhi rights himself on the platform, picking up his briefcase, his face a mixture of rage, humiliation, impotence. the conductor hurls gandhi's book at his feet as the train starts to move. gandhi picks up the book, looking off at the departing train. a lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into light and darkness. his point of view. the black porter stares out of a window at him, then we see the european taking his seat again, righteously. the conductor standing in the door, watching gandhi even as the train pulls out. then the second class coach, with people standing at the window to stare at gandhi then the third class coaches, again with blacks and a few indians looking at gandhi with mystification and a touch of fear. gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train pulls away but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform with self conscious embarrassment. a black railway worker looks as if he would like to express sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing wind. the policeman who pulled gandhi from the train talks with the ticket taker under the gas lit entrance gate, both of them staring off at gandhi. an indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her face half veiled. a small child sleeps in her arms, and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet. she turns away from gandhi's gaze as though it brought the plague itself. mr. baker's living room interior night featuring gandhi. as if a reverse angle from the previous shot, he is angry, baffled, defiant.}

<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.}
<A>__{reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and walker senses it. but they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a european (kallenbach) is perched above a doorway on the half completed structure, getting a level. some indians are working below him. gandhi turns to him, light hearted again.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{this is mr. kallenbach. he is our chief carpenter and also our chief benefactor. he has made this experiment possible.}

<C>__{walker}
<D>__{they tell me you also take your turn at peeling potatoes and cleaning the "outhouse" is that part of the experiment?}
<A>__{as we have approached we see a table set for tea under the awning. there are two places. having set the places, ba is walking along the side of the building, away from them. she glances at gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or acknowledging him.}

<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{it's one way to learn that each man's labor is as important as another's. in fact when you're doing it, "cleaning the outhouse" seems far more important than the law.}
<A>__{a grin but forced. when a girl (sora) comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting, gandhi calls to the driver.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{please come and join us you'll need something before your journey back.}
<P>__{(he nods to walker.)}
<D>__{excuse me a moment.}

<P>__{(like lead)}
<D>__{where do you expect me to go?}
<A>__{gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse. he sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding his head in his hands. ba studies him for a moment and she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. she moves and kneels before him.}

<D>__{what is the matter with me...?}
