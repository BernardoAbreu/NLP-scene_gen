<L>__{interior hell's sitting room day}
<A>__{white light fills the screen and kirsty steps through it into view. instantly the white light contracts and disappears. kirsty finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room. the room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day. the birdsong kirsty heard earlier continues but is, if anything, even more melodic, even more sweet. the room is vaguely edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings and decorative porcelain ornaments. there is a large wooden dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old fashioned brass frames. despite herself, kirsty cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at the appearance of the room. she touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is real. she approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed photographs. she gasps in pleasure. we see the photograph. it is a family group and looks to be have been taken ten to twenty years ago. it is of a man, a woman, and a young girl of four or five. the man is clearly larry, albeit a younger version, and the little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair just like kirsty's. the woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her daughter. kirsty's eyes prick with tears but they are clearly tears of happy memories. she smiles.}

<A>__{kirsty puts down the photograph of her family and looks around the room again. a troubled look crosses her face. despite the aparent summer light in the room, kirsty suddenly realises what it is that is odd. she looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face. there are no windows in the room. and no door. at this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes apparent. it is nothing too obvious at the moment the total effect is simply less sweet than it was. kirsty looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a look of concern. the photograph has changed. it is now a wedding photo. the wedding of larry and julia. suddenly the photograph begins to bleed. blood pours from the paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass so that it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the picture showing. the blood begins to escape out of the frame, trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping onto kirsty's fingers. with a cry of horror, kirsty drops the frame. it lands on the floor and the glass shatters. the blood continues to flow. in fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor. kirsty steps back and glances at the dresser. blood is flowing from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the floor. by now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much predominant and, as kirsty sweeps all the frames off the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking. kirsty throws her hands to her ears.}

<D>__{nooooo!}
<A>__{she rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her fists. the walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists strike, like flabby flesh. kirsty stands back in disgust. the wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling. the light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. it is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing. kirsty turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has given in to decay. the sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten, the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. a skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board. a rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which run wildly across the floor. suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke, churned up by an ever increasing intensity of wind. the smoke obscures the screen.}
