<L>__{interior city council room day}
<A>__{jones is at last on the stand. hahn stands before him, the rest of the city council, christine and the huge audience looking on.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{we then instituted a nationwide search. on july 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in de kalb, illinois. upon questioning, he admitted to being walter collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to california.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{where mrs. collins told you the boy was not her son.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{yes. she denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{but as subsequent events have demonstrated, she was correct. so what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. throughout this period, she acted strangely. she was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in de kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. it was because of her disturbing behavior that i submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of los angeles county general hospital.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{just like that. you snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{she wasn't }
<A>__{hahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{every home in this state is in grave danger when a police captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority!}
<A>__{the crowd applauds and cheers. joes fights to be heard.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(over the crowd)}
<D>__{she wasn't }
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{what was that, captain?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{she wasn't thrown. she was... escorted.}
<A>__{changeling a true story there's laughter from the gallery. he doesn't like it.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, captain. what does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant.}
<A>__{hahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{i am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the state of california vs. christine collins. who signed the affidavit?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{and what is the date on this document?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{september 12th.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{but mrs. collins was incarcerated on september 6th.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the form is backdated.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{yes, so it would appear. the bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served. but it has not been filled in. may i assume from this that the warrant was never served?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{that's correct. there was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{let me see if i have this straight. a woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because}
<P>__{(more)}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{hahn }
<D>__{she was already in the asylum! is this correct, captain?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{technically...yes.}
<A>__{more murmuring from the crowd.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation! is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be walter collins? no. in light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her?}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{because she questioned you.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, because }
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{because she was fighting for the life of her son! a boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong!}
<A>__{this silences both jones and the crowd. you could hear a pin drop. hahn approaches jones, and now speaks softly.}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{and in the end, that's what happened, isn't it? at some point, while all this was going on, walter collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the northcott ranch in wineville. is that correct, captain?}
<A>__{jones looks to chief davis. it's a moment. then:}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<A>__{christine's face falls into her hands. the place erupts. changeling a true story}
<C>__{hahn}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{hahn walks away from a devastated looking jones.}
