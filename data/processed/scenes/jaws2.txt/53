<B>__{bottle}
<A>__{macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of sodium cyanide, from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. follow the syringe and reveal brody, working at his desk in the deserted office. he is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed .38 hollow point ammunition; a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. the radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine reports faintly in the b.g. a slow night in pre season amity.}
<B>__{angle on brody}
<A>__{as a sound at the door makes him look up. he hides the odd gear as hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.}

<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{what camera?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that one from the wreck. you brought it up, did you look inside it?}

<C>__{brody}
<D>__{well, what the hell might be something worth seeing. take it somewhere and see if there's film in it...}
<C>__{hendricks}
<P>__{(catching on)}
