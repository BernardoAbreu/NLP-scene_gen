<L>__{interior ellie's office continuous}
<A>__{ellie is that editor. stylish and successful looking, she's about ike's age. ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on her pretty face. her casual looking husband, fisher, sits nonchalantly on the arm of the couch. ike enters as ellie reads maggie's letter.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(reading letter)}
<A>__{"anyway, i'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that i have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: ike graham's column on a platter. yours truly, maggie carpenter. p.s. i have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article. there are fifteen." ike sits as ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(chuckles as he sits)}
<A>__{fully. i like her. she has wit.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{i left four messages. you don't return my calls.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{so? i never returned your calls, even when we were married. and what's fisher doing here anyway? fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his way to the other side of the room.}
<C>__{fisher}
<A>__{ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{since when does ellie need moral supp }
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{ it's for you, ike.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{journalism lesson number one. if you fabricate your facts, you get fired. ellie pushes usa today lawyer's letter across the desk for him to read. ike picks it up and skims the letter. his face is as impassive as stone.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{lesson number two. never work for your former spouse.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{that's not nothing to do with it. you cooked this story up and you know it.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i didn't cook up a story. i had a source.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{someone reliable, i'm sure. a booze hound in a bar?}
<C>__{fisher}
<A>__{in vino veritas.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{don't knock drunk guys in bars. drunk guys in bars are good. it means they're not driving. ike gets up and stands near ellie, making his pointerior}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{besides, i'm a columnist. this is what columnists are supposed to do. this is what you like. we push, we stretch, we go out on a limo. that's what makes me good!}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{no, that's what makes you unemployed.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i merely write the stuff. you're the one that serves it up. ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his pocket.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{not anymore. i have to draw the line.}
<P>__{(pushing a piece of paper)}
<A>__{she sent us this list. our lawyers say it's actionable. ellie hands ike maggie's list.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<A>__{lawyers.}
<P>__{(glances at list)}
<A>__{i don't know, ellie firing me is going to be very tough on you. it's going to be hard to get over. there will be therapy bills for you.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<A>__{i already made an appointment for later today.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(putting the list down, standing)}
<A>__{see? you want custody of my job? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i've served my time?}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{i'm sorry, ike. this is permanent. fisher winces and looks away. ike and ellie look at each other for a sober moment.}
<P>__{ellie (v.o.; cont'd)}
<A>__{if you go quietly, i will get you severance pay. ellie fidgets with her toy rake, then ike heads for the door. he laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks out. ellie collapses back in her chair. fisher goes to her and rubs her shoulders.}
