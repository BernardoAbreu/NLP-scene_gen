<A>__{d 1 insurance office twelfth floor anteroom (day) two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work. several visitors are waiting in chairs. lola dietrichson is one of them. she's wearing a simple black suit and hat, indicating mourning. her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously. (now and then the telephone operators in the background are heard saying, "pacific all risk. good afternoon.") the elevator comes up and the doors open. several people come out, among them neff, carrying his briefcase. lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{hello, mr. neff.}
<A>__{neff looks at her a little startled.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{his voice hangs in the air.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{lola dietrichson. don't you remember me?}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(on his guard)}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{could i talk to you, just for a few minutes? somewhere where we can be alone?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. come on into my office.}
<A>__{he pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. as she passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation. d 2 twelfth floor balcony neff comes up level with lola and leads her towards his office, camera with them.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{is it something to do with what happened?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes, mr. neff. it's about my father's death.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm terribly sorry, miss dietrichson.}
<A>__{he opens the door of his office and holds it for her. she enters. d 3 interior neff's office (day) lou schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his desk. lola enters, neff after her.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(to schwartz)}
<D>__{lou, do you mind if i use the office alone for a few minutes?}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{it's all yours, walter.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes out. lola has walked over to the window and is looking out so schwartz won't stare at her. neff places a chair beside his desk.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{won't you sit down?}
<A>__{at the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a catch in her voice.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{mr. neff, i can't help it, but i have such a strange feeling that there is something queer about my father's death.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{queer? queer in what way?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i don't know why i should be bothering you with my troubles, except that you knew my father and knew about the insurance he took out. and you were so nice to me that evening in your car.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. we got along fine, didn't we.}
<A>__{he sits down. his face is grim and watchful.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{look at me, mr. neff. i'm not crazy. i'm not hysterical. i'm not even crying. but i have the awful feeling that something is wrong, and i had the same feeling once before when my mother died.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{when your mother died?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{we were up at lake arrowhead. that was six years ago. we had a cabin there. it was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia. she had a nurse with her. there were just the three of us in the cabin. one night i got up and went into my mother's room. she was delirious with fever. all the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open. the nurse wasn't in the room. i ran and covered my mother up as quickly as i could. just then i heard a door open behind me. the nurse stood there. she didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes i will never forget. two days later my mother was dead.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you know who that nurse was?}
<A>__{neff stares at her tensely. he knows only too well who the nurse was.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no. who?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{phyllis. i tried to tell my father, but i was just a kid then and he wouldn't listen to me. six months later she married him and i kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that. but now it's all back again, now that something has happened to my father, too.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you're not making sense, miss dietrichson. your father fell off a train.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes, and two days before he fell off that train what was phyllis doing? she was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on, and she was pinning a black veil to it, as if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look. you've had a pretty bad shock. aren't you just imagining all this?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i caught her eyes in the mirror, and they had that look in them they had before my mother died. that same look.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you don't like your step mother, do you? isn't it just because she is your step mother?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i loathe her. because she did it. she did it for the money. only you're not going to pay her, are you, mr. neff? she's not going to get away with it this time. i'm going to speak up. i'm going to tell everything i know.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you'd better be careful, saying things like that.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i'm not afraid. you'll see.}
<A>__{she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying. neff gets up and goes to her.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to act like this.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{all this that you've been telling me who else have you told?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{no one.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how about your step mother?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{of course not. i'm not living in the house any more. i moved out.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{and you didn't tell that boy friend of yours? zachetti.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i'm not seeing him any more. we had a fight.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{where are you living then?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i got myself a little apartment in hollywood.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{four walls, and you just sit and look at them, huh?}
<A>__{she turns from the window with a pathetic little nod.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(through her tears)}
<D>__{yes, mr. neff.}
