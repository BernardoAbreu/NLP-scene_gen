<A>__{elle sits, glaring at sarah, who keeps waving her "the rock" in elle's direction, as she plays footsie with warner. professor donovan — 40s, a big fan of himself, salt and pepper hair, no time for bullshit — stands before the class.}
<C>__{professor donovan}
<D>__{i should warn you that in addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this class, you'll also be competing for one of my firm's highly coveted four internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases. let the bloodbath begin. now, let's commence with our usual torture —}

<D>__{ms. woods —}
<A>__{sarah and her bitchy, clone like friend claire exchange knowing glances.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{this should be amusing.}
<C>__{professor donovan}
<D>__{would you rather have a client who committed a crime malum in se or malum prohibitum?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{neither.}
<C>__{professor donovan}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i'd rather have a client who's innocent.}
<A>__{elle smiles, proud of her answer. the class snickers. warner frowns.}
<C>__{professor donovan}
<D>__{dare to dream, ms. woods. ms. knottingham? which would you prefer?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{malum prohibitum. because the client would've committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime.}
<A>__{elle raises her hand.}
<C>__{professor donovan}
<D>__{yes? ms. woods?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i changed my mind. i ' d pick the dangerous one.}
<A>__{she looks pointedly at sarah.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i ' m not afraid of a challenge.}
<A>__{sarah glares back at her. warner looks between the two of them, worried.}
