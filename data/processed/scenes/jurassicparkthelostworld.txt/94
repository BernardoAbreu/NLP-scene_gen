<A>__{only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured. dieter claws forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself. he clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his hand to his belt buckle. he freezes, hearing something we didn't. he glances around, head darting, alert to any danger. nothing there. just a few distant animal calls and s scurrying around to his left. dieter snaps his head in that direction. at first, he sees nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him, he sees a small dinosaur, a compsograthus, the same chicken sized animal cathy saw on the beach so long ago.}

<A>__{the wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle, whimpering. dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out into more jungle. he stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back or forward. he looks behind him. he pauses, recalculating the path he took coming into the jungle, muttering to himself, gesturing with his hands, retracing his steps. he adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in that direction. but after five or six hard fought steps, he stops again. still nothing but jungle.}

<A>__{on the trail, dieter's cries are faint, but audible. the only marchers hear enough to hear him is carter, but the walkman is blaring in his ears.}

<D>__{...carter... me?...}
<A>__{in the jungle, dieter hears that scurrying sound again, this time from his right. he adjusts his angle again and scrapes through the foliage, moving faster and faster. panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on his face. he looks up. the scurrying sound comes again, this time ten times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him. dieter gasps as something rushes in at him. he whirls to his right. whatever it is rushes in from that side as well. and the left. and behind him. dieter scrambles up into a sitting position and laughs. he is surrounded by at least forty compys now, the same as the one he wounded. for a long moment, they just stare at him. slowly, he brings his gun around, to point it at them.}

<A>__{as one, the compys shriek and hurl themselves forward, covering dieter's body. their teeth and claws flash as they each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely. dieter screams and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly. some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off, smashing into trees or the ground. but dozens of others hang on, and dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on the ground. hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, screaming, shaking, swatting the compys loose. he spins, and that tactic seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and drop off of him. but he also loses his grip on his weapon, which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six feet from him. losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse, stopping ten yards away from him. but they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up and down, chirping and shrieking. dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun. but the compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his lost weapon. ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun. he turns to face the pursuing compys. they stop. dieter charges them, shouting, waving his arms. the compys turn and run. dieter stops. the compys stop. they stare back at him. there is a moment of quiet, then they start to hop again, chirping and}
