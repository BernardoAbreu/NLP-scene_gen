<L>__{116th street and frederick douglass boulevard.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{frederick douglass boulevard? what was wrong with just plain 8th avenue?}
<A>__{he considers the street itself. it too has changed. the corner groceries, as bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i used to sit here with ana in my old car. she hated it. now i don't even have a car. or her.}
<A>__{frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and across the street to where he shot tango. it isn't a fruit stand any more.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just do what?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the fuck is that? just do what?}
<A>__{it's a nike store with huge paintings of michael jordan and the admonition "just do it."}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{sneakers. expensive ones.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who the fuck would buy those?}
<A>__{a car equipped with sub woofer bass comes booming past. frank stares at it with the same pained look bumpy had at the discount emporium.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{your brothers know you're out?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i haven't talked to them in years. it's better that way. for them. i don't know where they are. went back to greensboro when they got out, i guess.}
<A>__{richie nods. frank looks back at the new storefronts.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what am i going to do now, be a janitor? what do i know how to do? how am i going to live?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i told you i wouldn't let you starve.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you told me but you can barely take care of yourself.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(glances to a pay phone on the corner)}
<D>__{you know, one phone call, richie, i could be back in business.}
<A>__{the look richie gives him calmly assures frank if he did that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison ever.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i won't. i'm just saying i could.}
<A>__{he buttons the cuffs of the fake members only windbreaker richie bought him off the street.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thanks for the clothes.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them like they own the sidewalk and everything around it baggy pants, bandanas tied around their heads.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh oh. look out. here come the gangsters.}
<A>__{frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. the gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on frank's face, thinks better of it. the others stop.}
<C>__{gangsta 2}
<D>__{what.}
<A>__{the first one is still staring at frank, but finally has the good sense to let it go.}
<C>__{gangsta 1}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{they move on. frank glances to richie.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{every idiot gets to be young once.}
<A>__{frank zips up his members only jacket, props up the collar and points himself in the other direction.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
