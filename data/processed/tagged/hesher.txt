<L>__{exterior street moments later}
<A>__{tj pedals in the middle of a suburban street. he steers his bike with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with the other. he glides down a hill. it's a long hill. he travels fast. despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and looks depressed.}
<L>__{exterior housing development moments later}
<A>__{tj rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development half built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets. up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road a big patch of dirt and rocks. he veers up a driveway to avoid it. he passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. he hits the road and loses his balance. the handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road. he jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. he looks at it. it's badly grazed. he yelps again, angry. he picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. he hurls the rock through its front window. glass crashes down. a silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late 20s, long greasy haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. he has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. this is hesher. he makes a determined line toward tj.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{the fuck you think you're doing!?}
<A>__{before tj can back away hesher grabs him by the back of his t shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house.}

<D>__{bullshit. you're gonna fuckin' }
<A>__{hesher is suddenly startled. his ears prick up like a rabbit. he hits the deck dragging tj down with him. their faces are close together. hesher makes a very serious finger to mouth gesture to 'shhhh'. the sound of a car idling outside. hesher listens. tj is on his stomach, freaked. tj looks around the room a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag. a car door closes loudly. hesher peers through the window and sees a security guard inspecting tj's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house. hesher looks at tj with serious and considered venom.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{you just fucked me.}
<A>__{hesher snaps into action. with speed and precision he gathers his stuff together. he shoves it all his duffel bag.}
<C>__{security guard }
<D>__{who's in there?}
<A>__{hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. he then slips out the back door, leaving tj face down on the floor freaked out and confused.}

<A>__{boom! dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the window. tj cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van starting up. he hears the van screech away.}
<D>__{security guard (o.s.) (cont'd) hey! get back here!}
<A>__{tj jumps to his feet and looks out the window. a dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake. the security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented. he rushes back to his car and gives chase. tj lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door.}

<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{i don't know what your fucking problem is, dude. why would you just reverse into her? that's fuckin' retarded.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}

<A>__{tj lifts himself up again to see what's going on. he sits low, concealing himself, and watches the altercation in the street.}

<C>__{driver}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}

<A>__{the guy gets in his car and speeds away, leaving hesher (shirtless) and nicole in the street. hesher stubs his cigarette, now totally relaxed again.}

<D>__{no, thanks.}

<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{this one time i had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and i had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like i had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while i'm trying to eat the other girl out, and i was going crazy man. it was too much. i couldn't work out which chick was which and i'm making one girl cum but then i'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually i was just like 'fuck this. this is too much' and i just stepped back. i just stepped back. and before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. they're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and i jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know?}
<A>__{nicole looks at hesher like he's crazy. tj is in the back he can't believe what's coming out of hesher's mouth. a moment passes.}

<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{a what?}
<A>__{he reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob metallica's, 'motorbreath' blasts through the speakers. as if he were possessed by the music, hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch. he has a crazed look in his eyes. tj and nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto. hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. the van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction. tj gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground. dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe. hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again. he turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station. ub40's 'red red wine' plays. a car honks as an angry driver passes.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<A>__{hesher looks over at nicole.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{i saw a mouse.}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{who's that guy?}
<A>__{hesher says nothing. they drive three houses down the street and stop again. hesher gets out. again he peers in the window, knocks on the door. this time no answer. he heads back to the van. nicole and tj watch him approach from inside. he sticks his head in.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{we're here. come on, let's go.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{we're where?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{my uncle's house.}
<A>__{hesher walks off toward the side gate of the house. nicole and tj climb out of the van and follow hesher. nicole seems cautious. tj knows he's on an adventure. hesher jumps the side gate, then opens it for the others.}

<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what was what?}

<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what? you're dirty.}

<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{now i'm dirty and wet too.}
<A>__{he splashes water at her. he dives under the water. suddenly tj is pulled under. nicole can't see them under all the motion. then tj and hesher come bursting up for air.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{cut it out.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{r2! shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level!}
<A>__{hesher dives under the water again. nicole squirms. hesher has her leg. he doesn't drag her under. he just tugs her leg. she slaps at the water. he tugs her leg again. pretty soon she's laughing. hesher's head appears above water momentarily.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{...all the fucking trash compactors...}
<P>__{(underwater, then up again)}
<D>__{...on the detention level!...}
<A>__{he dives again. he pulls her leg. she laughs hard. tj watches feeling a little left out. hesher jumps up and climbs out of the pool. he goes to a garden table nearby.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{oh, shit. more trash coming in!}
<A>__{he heaves the table over and into the pool. he grabs a banana lounge.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{he throws it in the pool. nicole and tj have to dive out of the way. they go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing, while hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water. tj and nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water. they're fully clothed and soaking wet. he walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more things to break. there is an awkward silent moment between tj and nicole. tj looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool. he manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{so, how do you know this guy?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't know, he's sort of moved into my grandma's house with us.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what, like he's renting a room or something?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{no, not really, i don't know, it's kinda a long story.}
<A>__{tj flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's climbing up his arm.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard?}
<A>__{tj stops mid ant flicking.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{sorry, i...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone? do you think their gonna miss her?}
<A>__{tj doesn't know how to answer. hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board. he climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool. hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it with his lighter. the diving board erupts into flames.}

<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{hesher}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{jump in the fi re.}
<A>__{hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board. he springs through the flames into the air. he does a messy sideways flip.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{fuck you bitches!!!}
<A>__{he lands in the pool splashing tj and nicole. he pulls himself out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog. he looks over at the flaming diving board.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{shit, look at that.}
<A>__{hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence. he doesn't look back.}
<C>__{hesher }

<D>__{what?}
<A>__{hesher hops over the fence.}
<C>__{hesher }
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{it burns when i urinate...}
<A>__{hesher disappears over the fence. we hear his van start and peel away. the flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as it crumbles into the pool.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{did he just leave us? i think we should get out of here.}
<A>__{nicole stands and heads for the gate, tj tags behind. they jump the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet.}

<D>__{ah, shit. fuck it.}
<A>__{in a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door. she gets in and slams the door behind her. she sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated. tj stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. he goes to the car and gets in beside her. he sits, still not knowing what to say. she tries to settle herself, but she's still very emotional.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{what have i done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? sometimes i wonder if i were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i would.}
<A>__{she lets out a small disbelieving laugh.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{that's nice of you to say, but i doubt it.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i would. if you died right now.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<A>__{tj thinks a moment. it's a sweet and sour moment. he wants to cheer nicole up, but he's remembering his mom at the same time.}
