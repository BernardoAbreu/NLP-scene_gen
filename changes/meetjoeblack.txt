<LOC>__{EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM}
<ACTION>__{A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.}
<LOC>__{INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM}
<ACTION>__{MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans.}
<LOC>__{INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM}
<ACTION>__{MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm. Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself:}
<CHAR>__{VOICE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{... Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes up:}
<CHAR>__{VOICE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Yes...}
<ACTION>__{It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild- ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.}
<LOC>__{EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. A Painter approaches.}

<LOC>__{EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ- ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish passes.}

<CHAR>__{ALLISON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...}

Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own. He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.}

<DIAL>__{You're not listening --}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a moment)}
<DIAL>__{Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.}

I started in this business because this is what I wanted to do.  I knew I wasn't going to write the Great American Novel, but I also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.  I wanted to give the news to the world, and I wanted to give it unvarnished.  The more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. Sure, I want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but John Bontecou is all profit.  If we give him license to absorb Parrish Communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to reach the world you will have to go through John Bontecou.  And not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him.  Reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable.  Parrish Communications has earned this priv- ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy it.  As your chairman, I urge you to agree this company is not for sale.}

A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know- ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it before. Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert- ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak- ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences. Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:}

<DIAL>__{Daddy!  We've been looking all over for you - this is your party - what are you doing in here?  Never mind. You're on.  Let's go.}
<ACTION>__{She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room, Joe right behind them.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears with Allison.  An enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.  He pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out.  APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech! Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd.  Joe observes from the fringe.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the guests)}
<DIAL>__{I thought I was going to sneak away tonight...}
<ACTION>__{YELLS of "No!"  "Never!"}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{...What a glorious night, every face I see is a memory.  It may not be a perfectly perfect memory -- sometimes we had our ups and downs -- but we're all together, and you're mine for a night.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a moment)}
<DIAL>__{-- And I'm going to break precedent, and tell you my one-candle wish -- that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say "I don't want anything more."}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(another moment)}
<DIAL>__{Sixty-five years - don't they go by in a blink?}
<ACTION>__{Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What a night.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm having a helluva time.}
<ACTION>__{A moment.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gently)}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry.}
<ACTION>__{Susan is examining Parrish very closely.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you relieved?}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, but --}
<ACTION>__{Parrish hesitates.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But what?}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Daddy --}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a moment)}
<DIAL>__{-- And I have no regrets.}
<ACTION>__{Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{And I want you to feel that way, too.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I love you, Daddy --}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's why it's okay.}
<ACTION>__{They drift into silence.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{No regrets?}
<ACTION>__{After a moment.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'No regrets'.}
<ACTION>__{A long silence, Susan smiles.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's a good feeling, isn't it?}
<ACTION>__{Silence again.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Everybody's saying goodbye...}
<ACTION>__{They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm still here.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a moment)}
<DIAL>__{Would you like to dance with me, Susan?}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, yes --}
<ACTION>__{He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.}
<ACTION>__{He takes her in his arms and they dance away.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.}
<CHAR>__{WAITER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I get you anything, sir?}
<ACTION>__{Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you have any peanut butter?}
<ACTION>__{The Waiter hesitates.}
<CHAR>__{WAITER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think so, sir.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, anyway.}
<ACTION>__{The Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{On the dance floor.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What was that?}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The fireworks are about to start.}
<ACTION>__{Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Parrish)}
<DIAL>__{Shall we?}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Happy Birthday, Bill.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you.}
<ACTION>__{They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe's gaze lingers.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Did you say goodbye?}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not exactly.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I guess you have your reasons.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Silence.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan?}
<ACTION>__{Joe waits.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{I never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you -- It was always what I wanted for her -- but what happens to her now?}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out.}
<ACTION>__{Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:}
<CHAR>__{JOE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{And would you mind if I expressed my gratitude...?}
<ACTION>__{Parrish waits.}
<CHAR>__{JOE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{For you.  For the time you've given me.  For the person you are.}
<ACTION>__{A moment.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.}
<ACTION>__{Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{It's hard to let go, isn't it?}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's life.  What can I tell you?}
<ACTION>__{A silence, an understanding there is another more to say. Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?", Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some- thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --}
<ACTION>__{But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step with him.}
<CHAR>__{PARRISH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Should I be afraid?}
<ACTION>__{Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not a man like you.}
<ACTION>__{Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Joe...?}
<ACTION>__{He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{You're here...}
<ACTION>__{He is trying to get his bearings.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- You bet.}
<ACTION>__{Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where did you go?}
<ACTION>__{Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place.}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out?}
<ACTION>__{Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded.}
<CHAR>__{JOE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{...But now I'm back.}
<ACTION>__{Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gently)}
<DIAL>__{That's it?}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You think so?}
<CHAR>__{JOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.}
<ACTION>__{Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away. Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken, a sudden intake of breath.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, you all right?}
<ACTION>__{His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The coffee shop --}
<ACTION>__{The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I asked you if I said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you.}
<ACTION>__{Susan holds herself very still.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{And forgive me for saying this -- but then you said -- and it's been with me ever since --}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What has --?}
<ACTION>__{He hesitates.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You said you liked me.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No --}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Y'didn't?}
<ACTION>__{A moment.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I said I liked you so much.}
<ACTION>__{She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, everything's going great -- don't y'think?}
<ACTION>__{She doesn't answer for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Don't you feel that way?}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...We know so little about each other.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But we've got time.}
<ACTION>__{She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long silence, the words come out haltingly:}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wish you could've known my father...}
<ACTION>__{Another moment.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Me, too.}
<ACTION>__{Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.}
<CHAR>__{SUSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...What do we do now?}
<ACTION>__{A long silence.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It will come to us.}
<ACTION>__{Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together they start back towards the party.}
