<A>__{a wig on a stand. a frumpy woman's outfit on a hangar. vera sits in front of the mirror and unties her own hair.}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{free at last.}
<A>__{rita collects vera's detested wardrobe to take back to wardrobe.}
<C>__{vera miles }
<D>__{thanks rita.}
<A>__{vera rubs cold cream into her face to remove her make up. in the mirror, she sees hitch in the doorway as rita squeezes past him on her way out.}
<C>__{vera miles }
<P>__{(wiping off her make up with a kleenex)}
<D>__{hello hitch.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{well, vera. you always make it look so easy.}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{oh, it was nothing, hitch. i just faked it.}
<A>__{she gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous miss america smile.}
<C>__{vera miles }
<D>__{well, i guess this is au revoir...}
<A>__{hitch comes and stands behind her chair, gazing at her in the mirror.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{why didn't you stay with me? i would have made you as big a star as grace kelly.}
<A>__{she considers the question and the man asking it, sensing something different about him now. she continues wiping off her make up.}
<C>__{vera miles}
<D>__{unlike grace kelly, i can pick up my dry cleaning. i've got a family, hitch. a home. that will always mean more to me than all of this.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that blonde woman of mystery you're after? she's a fantasy. she doesn't exist.}
<A>__{he studies her a moment.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{there was a time when i thought i understood you so completely understood women....}
<A>__{hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder, then leaves. vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of vulnerability.}
