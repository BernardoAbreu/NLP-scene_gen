<D>__{last night, we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess. today, the soviets are reneging. we're going to try to salvage the situation, but a lot of things are going wrong today. it's making everyone nervous, and it will be very hard to avoid going to war. don't get shot down, major. beyond that, whatever else you can do to help us, i'd really appreciate it.}
