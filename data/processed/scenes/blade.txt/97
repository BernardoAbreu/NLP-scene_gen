<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior frost's penthouse, inner chamber day}
<A>__{sparse decor in a neo japanese vein. minimalist lighting. the walls are glass. recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water cascading down them. karen is escorted into the room by mercury. she gestures to a chair at the end of a long table. karen sits.}
<B>__{frost}
<A>__{leans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table, hands steepled together.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{well, here we are, doctor.}
<A>__{a cigarette appears in frost's hand. in the blink of an eye, the cigarette is lit, burning. the movements are so quick we barely have time to register them.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why haven't you killed me yet?}
<C>__{mercury}
<D>__{deacon likes to play with his food before he eats it.}
<A>__{frost laughs. karen tries to keep calm. the longer she keeps them talking, the longer she remains alive.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how many of you are there?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{a few thousand scattered about the globe. in the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. that won't be necessary after tonight.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what happens then?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{the blood tide. our long prophesied holy war against the humans. there's a force, you see a spirit that exists in our blood. i've discovered a way to invoke it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{lamagra }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{that's right. the answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. my elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. but i knew better.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{imagine my surprise when blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.}
<A>__{frost sits forward now, impassioned.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{lamagra isn't a physical being. he's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{who better to usher in the blood tide?}
<A>__{karen shakes her head, protesting }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{there's no need for any of this. your condition can be treated. whistler and i were working on a cure when }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{what makes you think we want to be cured? blood is only part of the equation. the hunt, the killing, that's what the thirst is really about.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but you use blood banks }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{only as a last resort. preserved blood is inferior. there's no flavor left to it, no life.}
<P>__{(rising from his seat)}
<D>__{fortunately, i've found a way around that particular obstacle.}
<A>__{frost moves to the end of the room. he pushes a button. with a hum the wall slides open, revealing something karen wishes she'd never seen living blood banks.}
<B>__{three sedated humans}
<A>__{have been hooked up to iv feeds which replenish various nutrients as their blood is drained from them. shunts have been implanted in their forearms which serve as taps.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{under these conditions i can keep a donor alive for years, producing anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood.}
<P>__{(admiring his charges)}
<D>__{of course, this is just a pilot program, really. once the tide comes, we'll need to expand production. so many more mouths to feed }
<A>__{karen turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're a monster.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{why? because we live at another species' expense? your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? fattening them up with steroids? it's called evolution, doctor. survival of the fittest.}
<A>__{frost stares at karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i have a wake up call for the human race. you're no longer at the top of the food chain.}
