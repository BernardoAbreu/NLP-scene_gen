<L>__{exterior bandra bandstand. day.}
<A>__{jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. he moves around the beggars who are working the cars. then he hears singing. he looks around, suddenly panicked. it is a siren song drawing him across the road, not even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. he turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up against one of the struts of the flyover. arvind. older now, just like jamal, a fourteen year old boy. but eye less. jamal freezes. he approaches arvind and waits until he has finished singing. despite his eyeless sockets, arvind appears to know somebody is there. he turns and bows low, putting his hands together.}
<C>__{arvind}
<D>__{namaste, sahib. any kindness you give will be repaid in heaven many times.}
<A>__{jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts them into arvind's outstretched hand. he feels the notes with his fingers.}
<C>__{arvind }
<D>__{a fifty. and a hundred! blessings upon you, sahib.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{arvind}
<D>__{there are many ways of seeing.}
<A>__{arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again. then, jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred dollar bill.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{jamal crouches down and puts the bill into arvind's hand. his fingers feel it. he sniffs it.}
<C>__{arvind}
<D>__{dollars. but how many?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{one hundred.}
<C>__{arvind}

<A>__{he stops. suspects.}
<C>__{arvind }
<D>__{and without even a song?}
<A>__{a long pause. arvind keeps hold of jamal's arm.}
<C>__{arvind }
<D>__{so you are rich, now, are you, jamal? i am happy for you.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i am so sorry, arvind.}
