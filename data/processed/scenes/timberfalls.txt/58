<A>__{on black: a shrieking whistle sounds.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior ida's cabin day}
<A>__{close on mike's eyes snap open, dart side to side, blink. reveal mike lays on a ragged couch. the place is dark and dusty. a glance around... gaslights hang in the corners. a stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace. just off the main room is a kitchen alcove, with a coal stove. on the stove a whistling teapot. mike's memory slowly comes back. he leans up when...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{a sharp pain shoots through his body. mike reaches for his leg. the tourniquet conceals the damage. a damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is. a bandage has replaced the gray bandana on his arm. ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen. she removes the teapot from the burner. the whistling stops.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{look who's up.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you're in my home, michael. you gave me quite a scare. i thought i lost you.}
<A>__{ida grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and walks back to mike.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it. i know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing. that dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then i will get some "evening primrose" in you. same stuff the indian tribes used it back in the day to heal, well... just about everything. so's do i.}
<A>__{ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{try and relax.}
<A>__{ida cleans the wound. mike winces. he can't watch.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thank you. for saving my life.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you don't have to thank me. up here, we take care of one another. that's the only way any of us survive.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{um...}
<P>__{(thinks...)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i don't know your name.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{oh for the sake of sunshine... how rude a host am i? name's ida foster.}
<A>__{ida moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear liquid. it looks just like the jar mike bought from brody.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ida, i need some help.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm moving as fast as i can, sweetie.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, not me. it's sheryl. my girlfriend. you met her with me yesterday. something's happened to her. she was gone this morning when i woke up. i looked everywhere and i couldn't find her. we need to call someone. a ranger. somebody. we need to find her right away. do you have a phone?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i don't. never really had use for one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i do have a radio. we can call down to base if you'd like.}
<A>__{ida comes back to the couch.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{after we take care of you.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm fine, ida, please... if you could call now.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you want to lose this leg? cause that's what you're risking. soon as we're done, i will call. okay?}
<A>__{mike concedes. ida hands a second rag to mike.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{bite down on this... i ain't gonna lie... lotta pain about to hit you sweetheart.}
<A>__{mike puts the rag in his mouth. ida dips the used cloth in the moonshine. he closes his eyes tight, and... ida applies the moonshine to the wound. mike screams through the cloth.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{it's okay. it's almost over.}
<A>__{ida repeats. mike screams again. his eyes water. ida offers her palm. mike opens his mouth. the cloth falls into her hand. mike breathes heavily, coming down from the pain. ida crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths and grabs a larger towel. she walks back to mike and wraps his calf with the towel.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{we'll get some of that primrose in you and you'll be good as new.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ida? the radio. please... can you call down please?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i will take care of it right now.}
<A>__{ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room. she opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her. mike relaxes, as best he can anyway. until... knock, knock.}
<C>__{brody }
<D>__{ida, you in there?!}
<A>__{mike's pov through a small slit in the drapes, brody waits outside. ida exits the room, heads for the door.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{he's looking for me.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(whispers; concerned)}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{brody }
<D>__{ida!}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i think he had something to do with sheryl going missing.}
<A>__{knock, knock.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i will take care of it.}
<C>__{brody }
<D>__{ida, lemme in!}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm coming!}
<A>__{ida helps mike stand, re directs him to the kitchen alcove. he winces all the way. she leans him up against the near wall so that he is out of view of the door. ida goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an agitated brody, shotgun in hand. suspicious, brody tries to peek past ida into the cabin. she doesn't budge.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what took you so long?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{what do you want, brody?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i'm looking for a man hiker.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{this "man hiker" alone or wit someone?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he had a lady friend, but... i'm just looking for him now.}
<A>__{on mike listening nervously.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, i ain't seen no one in days.}
<A>__{brody glares at her. she glares right back. brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{what'd he do you for anyway?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he busted darryl's face in with a shotgun. left him a mess of blood and teeth. nearly killed him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{brody eyeballs ida one last time, then leaves. ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{he's gone. brody and those boys are a pain in the backside. i'm sure that cousin of his had it coming.}
<A>__{ida leads mike back to the couch.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what did the ranger say? does he need to speak to me? when is he coming?}
<A>__{ida heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot water into it. she dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{sorry, i wasn't able to reach anyone.}
<A>__{ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to mike.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{god damnit!}
<A>__{ida pauses...then:}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{please don't take the lord's name in vain in this house.}
<A>__{she glares long, cold and hard at mike, until...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{drink this.}
<A>__{ida hands him the steaming mug. mike's mind races.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{something's not right.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute. we'll try them again and we'll find sheryl. you'll see. she probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of "don't know where." happens lots of times.}
<P>__{(looks to the mug)}
<D>__{please drink up, michael, it will make you feel better.}
<A>__{mike holds the mug, stares at the drink. he puts it to his lips but then stops, looks at ida. she stares at him. unnerved by the stare, mike lowers the mug without sipping.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how did you know my name?}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{michael. you keep calling me michael. you did it just now. you did before, just after i woke up. you called me michael. nobody calls me michael.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm sure you're mistaken. you musta told me before.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, i would have told you "mike." only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me michael.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, how else could i have known your name?}
<A>__{angle on ida's boots.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(beat; thinks...)}
<D>__{on my driver's license and credit cards, it says michael. if you stole my wallet from the campsite... that's how you'd have known.}
<A>__{long beat.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you're accusing me of stealing your wallet? i saved your life. twice. why would i steal your wallet?}
<P>__{(mike doesn't respond)}
<D>__{now, just drink your primrose...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fuck the primrose!}
<A>__{mike tosses the mug across the room. it shatters. mike lifts himself up. despite the pain, he heads for the room ida went in to make the radio call.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i want to call the ranger myself.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of mike.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm getting in that room, ida.}
<A>__{mike maneuvers around her, when... ida grabs the iron fire poker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i can't let you in there.}
<A>__{mike takes a step forward. ida swings the poker. nearly hits mike. mike jukes left, she swings again. misses.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where is sheryl, ida? she's in that room, isn't she?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you sinners are all alike. i heard you last night. spitting in the face}
<C>__{ida }
<D>__{of the lord and his laws. dining on the sins of the flesh.}
