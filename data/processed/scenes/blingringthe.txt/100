<A>__{rebecca, marc, sam and nicki are looking through clothes. there are piles of bags and designer clothes on rebecca's bed. nicki and sam are squealing and trying things on, marc is styling them, and taking pictures of them posing in their `looks'. nicki puts on some crazy louboutins. he tells them how great they look. nicki and sam dance in front of the computer screen watching as they film themselves. marc goofs off around dancing with them, acting like a big shot pimp flanked by his girls.}
