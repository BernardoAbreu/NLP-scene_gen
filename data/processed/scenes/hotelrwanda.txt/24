<L>__{exterior hotel rear car park. night}
<A>__{paul walks to the employee car park at the rear. he sees gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing zozo's pillbox porter's hat between them with zozo trapped in the middle trying to jump and catch it. gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.}
<C>__{gregoire}
<D>__{come on, zozo, cockroaches can jump, some of them can fly.}
<A>__{he clerk sees paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat sails over gregoire's head and lands at paul's feet. zozo scampers to pick it up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(points to gregoire)}
<D>__{you pick it up.}
<A>__{gregoire doesn't move.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{how are your dish washing skills, gregoire?}
<A>__{gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to zozo, who walks away quickly. gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?}
<C>__{bik }
<D>__{cockroaches?}
<A>__{bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.}
<C>__{bik }
<D>__{don't tell me we have cockroaches, paul?}
<A>__{a sly smile breaks on gregoire's face as he uses bik's arrival to disappear inside.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, bik, it's a code word for tutsis.}
<C>__{bik}
<D>__{that's what i came to talk to you about.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{bik}
<D>__{the hutu tutsi thing. the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. and the u.n. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{leave it to me.}
<A>__{bik leans slightly closer.}
<C>__{bik}
<D>__{also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?}
