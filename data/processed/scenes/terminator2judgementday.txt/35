<A>__{a sign on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads: pescadero state hospital for the criminally insane. beyond it squats an imposing four story building. institutional brick. barred windows. about as inviting as kgb headquarters. security guards patrol the manicured grass.}

<A>__{sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall. the room is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink, toilet, and a dented metal mirror. we hear a rhythmic grunting, small explosions of breath in perfectly metered time. pan to a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing outward. a pair of sweaty hands grip one leg. tendons knot and release as someone does pull ups. a man of tangled hair hides the face that comes into frame, dips out, comes back. wider. a woman in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the top leg of the vertical bedframe. her body is straight and taut. knees bent so the feet clear the ground. the arms are lean and muscular. the inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up. like a machine. no change in rhythm.}
