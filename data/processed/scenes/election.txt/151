<D>__{dear lord jesus, i do not often speak with you and ask for things, but now i really must insist that you help me win the election tomorrow, because i deserve it and paul metzier doesn't, as you well know. l realize that it was your divine hand that disqualified tammy, and now i'm asking that you go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where i belong, so that i may carry out your will on earth as it is in heaven. if elected i promise that i will pray more often. okay? amen.}
