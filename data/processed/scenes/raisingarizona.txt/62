<L>__{exterior back of bank}
<A>__{as lenny bursts out. with a whipcrack effect he looks left, then right. he jerks the bike right, to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank.}
<B>__{alleyway}
<A>__{ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as lenny enters. he roars after her. lenny's pov roaring down the alley.}
<B>__{tracking in front of ed}
<A>__{as the bike approaches behind her. back to lenny's pov closing on ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley. a plank swings into frame, straight at the camera.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{matching action as hi finishes swinging the plank into lenny's face. lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him.}
<B>__{the bike}
<A>__{riderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses.}
<B>__{hi and ed}
<A>__{lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as hi nods encouragement to ed.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{run along now, honey.}
<A>__{lenny is reaching back to throw his knife. hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as the knife is thrown. it thunks into the plank, piercing it through. hi backs up, swinging the knife studded plank to make lenny keep his distance. tracking behind lenny's shoulder as he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder. lenny's hand as the free chain drops down into his palm.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{swinging the chain whoosh whoosh at the backpedaling hi.}
<B>__{the plank}
<A>__{as the chain snakes around it and rips it out of hi's hands.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{grabbing hi by the shirtfront. lenny's other hand swings down and brass knuckles appear on it.}
<B>__{on hi}
<A>__{as lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. an uppercut from his heels sends hi sprawling back.}
<B>__{a parked car}
<A>__{as hi lands against it, banging his head. he sinks to the ground. lenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot. hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car.}
<B>__{from under the car}
<A>__{hi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape. behind him we can see lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. the shot is framed identically to the shot in the arizona nursery where hi pulled a baby from under the crib. lenny pulls. hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{struggling to stand up. lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug. hi's arms crushed against lenny. his hands paw futilely at lenny's chest.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{lenny finally flings hi away.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{tired of the fight: he saws out both shotguns}
<B>__{the hammers}
<A>__{on the guns as lenny's thumbs draw them back. he raises the guns to fire.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{the end of the road. he wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him then stops, staring at: hi's hand a hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of his fingers. pawing at lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{reacting.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{reacting to hi reacting. he looks down. lenny's chest on the bandoliers across his chest, silver pins glint in all the grenades except one. its squeeze lever juts at a right angle from the grenade. lenny's face hi's jaw drops. lenny's feet the lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{scrambling to his feet.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands. in his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{starting to run.}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{finally freeing his hands.}
<B>__{hi}
<A>__{diving behind the parked car. lenny's chest his hands fly in to wrap around the grenade too late bright light:}
<B>__{lenny}
<A>__{blows sky high. there is a roar as if the earth were cracking open and flame as if hell were slipping out. we pan the fire to the sky.}
