<L>__{exterior bayfront day}
<A>__{catherine and bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the dupea property. each is staring out at the ocean, and after a moment:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no. it's useless, robert. it wouldn't work, not ever...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{just give me a chance, will you?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. it's not just because of carl, or my music, but because of you...}
<P>__{(she looks at him)}
<D>__{i mean, what would it come to? if a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... how can he ask for love in return? i mean, why should he ask for it?}
<A>__{profoundly wounded, he looks away from her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(looking back to her)}
<D>__{that'll make you happy.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i hope it will, yes.}
<P>__{(she pauses, then:)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{needing to distance herself from witnessing his pain, she gets up and moves out of frame. his eyes move from her to look out over the bay and, after a brief silence, he softly utters:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay.}
