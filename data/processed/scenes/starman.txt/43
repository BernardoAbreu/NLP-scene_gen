<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{jenny gets there two steps ahead of the star man. she slams the door in his face and locks it. with him pounding on the outside, jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats. the pounding stops. it takes her a moment to hear the silence. when she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, but it remains closed. she waits. all she can hear is the sound of the rain. she intensifies her search.}

<D>__{it's got to be here... it's got to be here...}
<A>__{she finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. the army issue .45 looks big in her hand. she releases the safety and, with a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night table next to the bed. long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the "bleet" caused by the phone being off the hook for so long in the living room. she hangs up and walks around the bed to sit on the corner facing the door. in the distance, we can hear the thump of an approaching helicopter. after a moment's indecision, jenny gets up and releases the lock. again she waits. nothing happens. with the gun ready, she turns the knob and opens the door a crack. the hallway is empty. she kicks off her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.}
