<A>__{close on the herodotus. the patient opens its cover, held together by leather ties. loose papers, photographs, hand drawn maps and sketches are all collected between the pages. he claws at some water colors which appear to be based on cave paintings figures, dark skinned warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with plumes in their hair arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like those of matisse. some appear to be swimming, another is diving. then the patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel spills to the floor with a crack.}
