<L>__{interior mr. deetchum's apartment morning}
<A>__{the rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at the ceiling. between crows there's a tapping at the door. you might call this a "barnyard" apartment. there's straw on the floor and several hens roosting against the back wall. the front door opens a few inches and sebastian pokes his head in.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{mr. deetchum? hello?}
<A>__{nobody seems to be home except his chickens. as sebas tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{now, now, waddles.}
<A>__{seeming to recognize sebastian as no intruder, waddles veers off from the attack. as sebastian crosses the room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{hello, wrigley.}
<A>__{he goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting them into a bowl he's brought. he puts down the bowl and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the payment and puts the money on a plate. he's about to leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{mr. deetchum isn't taking very good care of you people.}
<A>__{pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets his bowel of eggs and leaves. wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for a long drink.}
