<A>__{charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind. he sits down on the sofa. the world unbends as charlie takes off the glasses. kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind. charlie looks upstairs to find... sam and craig kissing. craig leads her to the bedroom. charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the new years countdown. patrick leads the charge.}
