<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, you were. what you said about them taking me out to the woods...}
<A>__{mackenzie clams up slightly at the mention of it...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what do you know about the jacket?}
<A>__{mackenzie's eyes start to twitch nervously.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i know you need one when it's really cold.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[cutting in] mackenzie, listen to me. listen. i'm going to die.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. it means you're sane on some level.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[gravely] no, i mean in four days, i'm supposed to die.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{[beat] how do you know?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{the jacket.}
<A>__{mackenzie grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{oh no, you're pretty young. your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. [beat] i mean i found out while i was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.}
<A>__{just then, nurse harding is upon them. she carries a rod in her hand which she taps menacingly on the floor as she walks towards them.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{what are you two yappin' about?}
<A>__{starks tenses up as he sees only the rod, which could inflict a gash if hit across a man's head the right way. nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this pointerior}
<D>__{mackenzie [spoken like a nut] [beat] we're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future. [to starks] that is what we're talking about here, right?}
<A>__{starks is startled mackenzie gets it.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, it is.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{you know something? you're two fucking freaks is what you are. starks [smiling] well, no shit, einstein. what do you think we're doing in this place?}
<A>__{mackenzie tries not to laugh but a chuckle slips out.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food.}
<A>__{harding walks away with a final stare that starks returns.}
<D>__{starks [under his breath] i gotta get back in it, mackenzie.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{it's gonna be sticky.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{mackenzie's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in its sudden jerks accompanying every word.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{'cause lorenson's got her claws in it now. when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. women!}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{so what am i supposed to do?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{you could still always give becker an itch. 'course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [beat] just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.}
