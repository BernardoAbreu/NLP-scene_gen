<A>__{jane walks adam to the door. he holds rolled blueprints.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort i've ever had... like, in my life.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{aw, thank you. i always make ice cream when i can't sleep, so i'm glad someone was here to eat it.}
<P>__{(opens door)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(pauses...)}
<D>__{great getting to know you a little.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it was really fun.}
<A>__{adam waves, jane waves. definitely a little sweet awkward. jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for the kitchen, when there's a quick knock on the front door.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{woops! coming!}
<A>__{jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:}
<B>__{jake}

<C>__{jake}
<D>__{mmmmm. love when you smell like butter.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(easing away)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{missed you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it's nine o'clock. where does your wife think you are?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{at yoga. shall we do some downward facing dog?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not tonight big guy.}
<A>__{they cross into the kitchen. camera tracks.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes? i won't think less of you, you know.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{really, jake, i'm a little tired, i was just gonna take a bath.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{good. so, we'll just hang out.}
<P>__{(now in the kitchen, he}
<D>__{sees the dinner dishes on}
<P>__{the counter)}
<D>__{ooooo, is that croque monsieur? who's plate is this? yours or his?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(eats her leftovers, savors the taste)}
<D>__{oh my god, just as i remember it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{don't you ever eat at your house?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate.}
<P>__{(sees melted ice cream)}
<D>__{what kind of ice cream is that?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{lavender honey.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{not sleeping?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not at all. you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{never slept better. and my digestion is finally back on track. you've turned my world right side up, jane. you know what this means, don't you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that i've never really known how to live without you.}
