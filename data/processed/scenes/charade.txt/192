<L>__{exterior palais royal courtyard colonnade night}
<A>__{the smaller court at the comedie francaise end of the palais gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each in all, eighty columns. the only person in sight is the man we have known as bartholomew, waiting at the far end of the columns, looking at his watch impatiently. then, from the rue de valois side of the palais, reggie runs into the court. she spots "bartholomew" and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving them.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{mr. bartholomew he's chasing me!}
<A>__{adam has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots "bartholomew." reggie, still running, is halfway between the two men. "bartholomew" draws his gun but can't get a shot at adam, who has ducked in among the columns.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{reggie stop! that's carson dyle!}
<A>__{this news hits reggie hard and she stops, in alarm.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{carson ?}
<A>__{she looks at "bartholomew," then back at adam, who has drawn his own gun. (note: both "bartholomew" and adam are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other's sight. reggie stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).}
<D>__{"bartholomew"}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{we all know carson dyle is dead, mrs. lampert.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's carson dyle, i tell you! "bartholomew" you're not going to believe him, mrs. lampert it's too fantastic. he's trying to trick you again.}
<A>__{reggie looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{tex recognized him that's why he said dyle. if you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too!}
<A>__{reggie takes a step toward adam.}
<D>__{"bartholomew" mrs. lampert if i'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now?}
<A>__{reggie stops, turns back to "bartholomew."}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{because he'd have to come out to get the stamps he knows he'd never make it. "bartholomew" what's the matter with you, mrs. lampert? are you going to believe every lie he tells you? he wants the money for himself that's all he's ever wanted.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(to adam, explaining)}
<D>__{he's with the c.i.a. i've seen him at the embassy.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{don't be a fool! he's carson dyle! "bartholomew" that's right, mrs. lampert i'm a dead man look at me.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i don't know who anybody is any more!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{reggie listen to me!}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{you lied to me so many times }
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{reggie trust me once more please.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{can i really believe you this time, adam?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{there's not a reason on earth why you should.}
<A>__{she looks toward adam for a moment, then back to "bartholomew", then slowly starts toward adam.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{all right, adam. "bartholomew" stop right now, mrs. lampert, or i will kill you.}
<A>__{reggie stops in alarm.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it won't get you the stamps, dyle you'll have to come out to get them, and i'm not likely to miss at this range. "bartholomew"}
<P>__{(now called carson)}
<D>__{maybe not but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. they left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach they knew i was still alive but they left me. i spent ten months in a german camp with nothing to stop the pain and no food they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. they deserved to die!}
<A>__{med. shot adam during the following, he looks around, looking for some way out.}
<C>__{reggie's voice }
<D>__{but i didn't have anything to do with }
<C>__{carson's voice }
<D>__{you've got the money. it belongs to me now! please believe me, mrs. lampert i will kill you a little more blood won't matter.}
<A>__{during this adam has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second. med. shot reggie and carson}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{i will give you five to make up your mind, mrs. lampert.}
<A>__{she has seen adam's move from her angle, but doesn't know quite what to do.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{wait, please! i need some time to think!}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{one }
<A>__{med. shot adam as he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his gun ready, trying to get an angle on carson.}
<C>__{carson's voice }
<D>__{ two }
<A>__{suddenly adam stops he has caught sight of carson through the columns. but he will have a difficult shot.}
<C>__{carson's voice }
<D>__{ three }
<A>__{close shot carson}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{ four }
<A>__{camera pans down to his gun. as his finger tightens on the trigger and the hammer moves slowly back. close shot reggie}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{adam please!}
<A>__{med. shot adam as he aims carefully and fires. close shot column as the bullet creases it. close shot carson as the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. he wheels. med. shot adam with carson in the b.g., who fires at him. adam ducks behind the column as the bullet hits it and screams off. quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot. med. shot reggie seeing carson otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward the open stage door of the comedie francaise behind her. (beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming schedule of presentations.)}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{including carson who, seeing reggie running to the door, turns and fires at her. but he is too late she is safely inside. carson looks quickly back toward adam, then takes off after reggie. med. shot adam over his shoulder we see a broken picture of carson running toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns. adam tries to get a shot at him, but can't. finally he runs after him.}
