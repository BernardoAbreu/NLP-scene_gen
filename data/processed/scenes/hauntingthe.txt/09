<L>__{interior psych observation lab day}
<A>__{the lab feels more like the video center of a security office than a psychologist's laboratory. two banks of black and white monitors give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, wired to electrodes. they are taking psychological tests, although we never see the testers. the subjects are working through variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests. there are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors. on the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no discernible sequence. the subjects on the left are better able to concentrate on their tasks. the subjects on the right keep stopping, and going over what they have done. two men,}
<B>__{malcolm keogh}
<A>__{, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the head of the department; someone we trust. he faces}
<B>__{professor james marrow}
<A>__{. he is a man whose confidence rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two is the power that makes him the teacher students love. right now, though, he is defending himself before a department review. this is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free form. the men are having a fight, and they are watched by other}
<B>__{professors.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's still an electric shock!}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{come on malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! and it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...}
<A>__{malcolm looks at the monitor. this is marrow's chance to explain it again.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{look, look at what it does! the subjects on the left, because they anticipate the shocks, make the adjustment, and lose nothing on their scores. the subjects on the right, because the shocks are random, can't anticipate, and the distraction throws them off.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{stop defending your science after the fact, jim. the department protocol for research is very clear about this, and you violated the rules. i know, i know, i know that "fear and performance" is a big sexy idea, but as long as i'm chairman here you will need this department's endorsement to publish it, and right now i can't do that.}
<A>__{at this moment,}
<B>__{mary lambretta}
<A>__{, late 20's, marrow's pretty t.a., opens the door with an armload of files. whatever else she's wearing, she wears glasses. marrow, seeing her, motions for her to go away. he doesn't break eye contact with malcolm. mary hesitates...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{malcolm, this is essential work i'm doing. just think what my research can do for education. elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{and that will be a good place to end this study.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no, malcolm! individual performance is only part of it. i know why baseball players choke for no reason, i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what i want to know is, how fear works in a group...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{but if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. the deception is minor.}
<A>__{malcolm sees mary lambretta.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you working with her?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{mary, i will meet you outside.}
<A>__{she understands, and she closes the door.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{why are you working with her? mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a ph.d. in psychic studies.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{and after she was thrown out, she needed a job.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you don't believe in the paranormal.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no, but she does, and that's all that matters.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{does she know that's why you're using her?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i, i just can't...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{she needed a job, malcolm. and she's smart. and she helps me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i have a bad feeling about what you're doing.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{this is the last chapter. please, please give me clearance. it's for science.}
<A>__{marrow waits.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm gonna hate myself for this.}
<A>__{but he nods. permission granted.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{thank you.}
