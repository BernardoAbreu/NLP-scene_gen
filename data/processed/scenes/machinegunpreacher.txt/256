<L>__{exterior riverbank children's orphanage day}
<A>__{we see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful dresses... scrubbing pans and washing clothes... singing an ancient african spiritual as they work... the sun dropping pale red on the horizon... and we see sam here too... alone with himself... sitting at the river's edge, watching the water rolling gently past... listening to the soft serenade of the women... the beauty of it all... ... and then he gets up and walks into the river... and he kneels down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first baptism in scene #35)... and now the women on the riverbank stop their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans back... submitting to the water... and when he comes up again we see in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act. and the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we go...}
