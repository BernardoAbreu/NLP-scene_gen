<L>__{interior station house day}
<A>__{ray, gloria and bryce hunter stand at one end of the long conference table, watching the playback of kelly's tape.}
<B>__{back to videotape}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{the next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. his fingers... his fingers...}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{take your time.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they were in me. both places... you know.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he said something like, "do you want it dirty7" or something.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{was there penetration? did he put himself inside you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yes. i said stop. i screamed. i mean that's how it sounded in my head. he hurt me...}
<C>__{gloria }
<P>__{(as kelly breaks into tears)}
<D>__{that's okay, kelly. you're doing fine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i have to ask you something here. when you say it hurt. was this the first time a man was inside you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no. i've done it a couple of times, i mean with guys i dated. but this hurt... like, he was built... you know...}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{he was large?}
<A>__{kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.}
<P>__{gloria (o.s., cont'd)}
<D>__{did you try to fight him?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i... he had my wrists pinned behind me. i remember my hands were cold.'}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he kept saying, "let it happen, let it happen." then he just stopped.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{you mean he withdrew...}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{not at first. he was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... he said we had this secret. and that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... something like that. i don't know. it's hard to remember, exactly.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{try, kelly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i know one thing he said. it was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he said, "don't worry, i didn't come." i can't forget that. he said, "no little girl can ever make me come."}
<A>__{the tape is paused freezes on kelly's face on screen. back to ray, gloria & hunter}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{"no little girl can ever make me come." jesus. too bad. we might have some physical evidence.}
<A>__{ray and gloria stare at the screen.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{i don't know. it feels wrong.}
<A>__{ray and hunter look at her.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{i think she's acting. i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think maybe she's upset that he didn't...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{the line i get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in blue bay.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{that doesn't make him a child rapist.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's something else. this girl's had some problems. wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. ran away...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{where's this coming from?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{i worked juvenile in dade county for three years. we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks... maybe a year ago... the family kept it out of the papers.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. you don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{all i'm saying is, i think we should go slow here.}
<A>__{hunter puts his hands together, thinking. he looks from ray to gloria, than back to ray.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{i want a full scale investigation.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{you know what that will mean for lombardo.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{i don't care. you heard that girl's statement. i think he's dirty. get me a case.}
<A>__{gloria and ray watch as hunter gets up and leaves the room.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{well you were a big help. you know what's going to happen if we go full bore on this.}
<A>__{ray looks at the screen.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's our job, gloria.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{hunter's making it our job because sandra van ryan's got a bug up his ass. you know that as well as i do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we're gonna trash this guy's life and i keep asking myself if it's really necessary.}
<A>__{ray thinks this over. he continues to study the screen. close on screen kelly's face}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about him. maybe he's got it coming.}
<A>__{begin montage investigation}
