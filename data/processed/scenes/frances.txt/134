<A>__{dark. blinds drawn. we see a single light with a green shade, hear the soft coo of lillian's voice. the camera shifts gradually onto her earnest face.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{all my life, i've tried to live up to my parents' example. to have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great. i taught that to frances: speak out. aspire. make something of yourself, something }

<C>__{dr. doyle}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{yes, yes, mrs. farmer }
<C>__{alma styles}
<D>__{frances has always been a battleground, lillian.}
<A>__{dr. doyle, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with judge hillier around a table.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{the point is: it's your opinion that frances is getting steadily worse?}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{well... yes.}
<A>__{doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{and you feel you're unable to control her any longer?}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{no... i mean, yes, doctor.}
<A>__{alma holds up lillian's bruised wrists as evidence.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{and the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution?}

<D>__{well, alma told me that...}
<A>__{alma looks coolly at lillian.}
<C>__{lillian}

<P>__{(closing his folder)}
<D>__{i believe that's all i need to know about miss farmer.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{i think in all future documents she should be referred to as mrs. r. h. richardson.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{her married name?}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{yes. it's less recognizable. i'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{...oh yes.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{now. can you tell us where we might find frances?}
