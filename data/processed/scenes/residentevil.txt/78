<A>__{down in the corridor, the other troopers see... ...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... agile shapes advancing... not along the floor, but along the ceiling! they look like apes, swinging from... what could they be swinging from? the ceiling is solid metal. close on: a monstrous hand, both hairy, and scaly. it's fingers have ten inch claws.. .more like horns... which punch upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on. the shot widens to reveal a beast, unlike any we've seen, dangling from the ceiling. it is ape like... and lizard like. with ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect like carapace. this thing is an amalgam of all the nasty creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. it's called... a hunter. there are six of them... as far as we can see, there might be more coming from behind. their three toed feet also have claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move forward... hand over foot, foot over hand. one of them lets out a grrrowllll! the same sound we've been hearing through the walls. now it echos in the corridor, up close and personal. the troopers open fire, even before the creatures get in range.}
