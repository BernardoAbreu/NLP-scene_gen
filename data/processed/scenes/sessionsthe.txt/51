<L>__{interior carmen's place. day}
<A>__{vera eases mark onto the bed, positioning him so that he can see the doorway. as a finishing touch, she dabs a little cologne behind his ears, then puts the mouthpiece of his respirator within easy reach. carmen picks up her bag and wheels herself to the door.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{okay, i'm going. i will be back some time after one. if i'm not here, just let yourselves out.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{have fun.}
<A>__{she lets herself out.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's the time?}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{twelve after eleven.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{mark, please calm down.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and if she does arrive, she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. they stare at the door. vera finally goes over and opens it. silhouetted against the light is cheryl with a substantial bag. she could be the avon lady. she has a light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{hi, i'm cheryl. i'm sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{no, that's fine. come in. i'm vera, i'm one of mark's helpers.}
<A>__{cheryl sees mark. there is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{hi, mark o'brien.}
<A>__{mark clears his throat with a little difficulty.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hi, cheryl cohen greene.}
<A>__{vera is already at the front door.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{i will be back, say, in two hours?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes, two hours, that would be perfect.}
<A>__{she closes the door behind her. mark feels totally abandoned.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{so...}
<A>__{mark blurts out.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{your money's on the dresser.}
<A>__{cheryl walks over to the dresser. when her back is turned, mark screws up his face in self disgust. she finds an envelope.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she puts it in her bag. mark eyes her carefully.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that was the wrong way to start off.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes, it was. shall we start again?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please, you start.}
<A>__{she sits down on the bed and looks at him. it is a very frank stare. she is trying to take a lot in.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{although the aim is for us to have sex, i'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. i've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. we can talk about that later.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{the other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. did laura mention that when you saw her?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't remember.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{the limit is six. but that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. now, i understand you are able to have an erection.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, but not out of choice.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection?}
<A>__{she looks around the room.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{is this your place?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, it's a friend's. the only bedroom furniture i have at my place is an iron lung. i've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{it's worth thinking about.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've got the space. it can be expensive though, a nice futon. i mean, how much do you think a good one would cost?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mark, just take a deep breath, then let go.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do i seem anxious?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you do a little.}
<A>__{cheryl lies down beside him.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{laura told me you were a poet. what's it like to be a poet?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's a way of living inside your own head, which is where i spend most of my time.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{but not today. by the way, i like your shirt.}
<A>__{he smiles, genuinely flattered.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{so i need to ask you some basic questions. okay?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{what is the iron lung for?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it keeps me breathing. i can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how i feel. but i work and sleep in the iron lung.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{how do you feel right now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{out of my league.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i meant your breathing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh...fine. in fact, better than usual.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{that's great. do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity? any parts of your body you don't want me to touch?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i have normal sensitivity all over. it's just that my muscles don't work. you can touch me anywhere.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{shall we get undressed then?}
<A>__{mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. he hesitates momentarily.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. mark's terror is visible in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. she starts to slowly extract one of mark's arms from his shirt sleeve. suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{ow! ow! stop! it hurts!}
<A>__{she recoils, shocked.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{holy mother of god!}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{tell me what's wrong.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{my fingers! they're caught!}
<A>__{she discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{okay, okay, i've got it. don't worry.}
<A>__{she carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{be careful, please.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mark, i'm going to be really careful with you. i don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. okay?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i won't yell at you any more.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{but you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{now, let's do the other arm.}
<A>__{little by little, she extracts the other arm. he grimaces his way through it, but more in fear than in pain. she finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{nice shirt.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you already said that.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{did i? i guess i'm a little anxious, too.}
<A>__{she undoes the top of his pants.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{okay, i'm going to slide these down. hold your breath.}
<A>__{she pulls. he screams, in fear more than pain.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{shit, fuck! no, don't do that!}
