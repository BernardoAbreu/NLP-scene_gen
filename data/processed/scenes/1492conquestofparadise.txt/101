<L>__{interior alcazar's palace in seville dining room night}
<A>__{close on: the face of a young, spanish nobleman, adrian de moxica. hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his lips then pauses. we discover other people around the magnificent candle lit table. noble men and noble women. sanchez. columbus.}
<B>__{queen isabel.}
<A>__{columbus takes the cigar from moxica. the rest watch him with rapt curiosity. columbus inhales deeply then, to their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{you must not inhale, but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the tobacco...}
<A>__{he hands the cigar back to moxica. with a casual air, moxica himself inhales deeply almost chokes to death. he gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of the others.}
<C>__{moxica}
<P>__{(deeply embarrassed)}
<D>__{and you say this is an indian vice? by god! i don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{the indians have no such word, don moxica.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{do they have such thoughts?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{they come and go as naked as the day god created them...}
<A>__{isabel blushes slightly.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{they don't see sin in their nakedness. they live according to nature, in a never ending summer. the islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. and...}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{forgive me, don colon. but what about gold?}
<A>__{columbus nods, turns and whispers something to a servant standing just behind his chair. the servant goes to open the door and in comes utapan, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket. the women around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight. utapan puts the casket down in front of the queen, and steps back.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{these are gifts for your majesty.}
<A>__{isabel opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside. she takes out some of the little golden ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask. she holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty. isabel raises the mask to her face, looking across at}
<B>__{columbus.}
<A>__{the image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the aristocrats to silence. she speaks from behind the mask.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{we are more than gratified.}
<A>__{the guests laugh obsequiously. columbus bows a little looks up and meets the eyes of sanchez, who is staring at him, coldly.}
