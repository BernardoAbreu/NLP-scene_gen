<L>__{168. interior the tunnel}
<A>__{the walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out of the darkness as the hair raising chase continues short round and willie struggle to help indy lift a large boulder from the bottom of the speeding mine car. the cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where the beams flash past inches above them. indy judges the beams }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{okay one two now!}
<A>__{all three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it off the back of the car ducking instantly to avoid being de capitated by the next beam! looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see the boulder in front of them! the thuggee car hits the boulder and upends! the guards scream horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower down the tunnel! willie whoops for joy and hugs indy who smiles modestly }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{okay, shorty, hit the brakes!}
<A>__{short round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the brake lever it doesn't work! short round yanks on it harder the brake level suddenly breaks off!}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{indy!!}
<A>__{indy sees short round holding up the broken brake lever! indy crawls quickly toward shorty while willie holds on for dear life! completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath. he sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake pad. indiana pulls himself back up and looks at willie and short round.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{grab onto me i'm going to try and slow us down from underneath!}
<A>__{willie looks terrified but helps short round grab onto indy's arm and the back of his jacket. he skips over the front of the car and swings a leg underneath indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake pad. his feet fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car. as they hold onto him, indy kicks again and his foot hits the brake pad. he shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the spinning wheel...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{willie and short round look up and see that the tunnel is ending ahead and the track dead ends into a stone wall!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he looks around and sees the car rocketing directly toward the stone wall! indy's foot starts kicking in high gear underneath the car he slams at the brake pad with all his strength the pad screeches against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking! the car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel. indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake pad. the car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards to the dead end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing indy's back against the wall....}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{ouch...}
<A>__{willie looks faint as indiana gets to his feet and shorty jumps out of the car. they help willie out and she stands shakily }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm okay i'm fine i love to flirt with death...}
<A>__{indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more tracks. then they hear something a strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind them. the walls seem to reverberate. looking worried, they start walking away down the tunnel. they walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they keep glancing over their shoulders }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what's that?...indy?!}
<A>__{indiana isn't sure and he pulls willie by the arm and all three of them start jogging. the rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally they start running full tilt. they rush down the tunnel and the awful noise becomes defening! willie looks around again and slows suddenly willie stops dead in her tracks paralyzed awestruck doomed! willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as it thunders around a curver a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall! a veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing furiously forward like a hydrous juggernaut!}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(frozen in her tracks)}
<D>__{oh... shit...}
<A>__{indiana and short round notice that willie's sloed and they stop running they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the tunnel toward them. indy runs back and grabs willie. all three of them take off, running faster than they've ever run in their lives! the tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and indiana realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race. suddenly he sees a small side tunnel in a bend ahead }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{there! dive!}
<A>__{they lunge toward the hole and short round dives in it first. indiana shoves willie into the hole and jumps in after her just as the colossal tidal wave explodes past!}
