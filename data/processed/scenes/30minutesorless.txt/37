<A>__{will fires up the engine.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{given the situation, i think you should obey all traffic safety laws.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{will pulls out of the school parking lot.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay, so where are we going?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i have no idea. i just got in your car. i thought you had a plan.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{well, i don't! i've been sorta preoccupied with this crushing fear of death!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{no plan. i can't say i'm surprised.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{your plan is probably better. just condescend me until i explode.}
<A>__{will goes to turn on the radio. chet grabs his hand.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{maybe we should turn on the radio. see if the signal sets the bomb off. that would be an interesting experiment.}
<A>__{will heaves a frustrated sigh. chet eases up.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{listen, let's just go back to my place. figure out our options. maybe you can get the vest off or something. i just don't want to do anything stupid.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{unless we have to.}
<A>__{the car hits a rough pothole. chet's heart skips a beat }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{holy fucking shit!}
<A>__{ and he throws himself against the passenger side window, as far from will as the confines of the car will allow. will slams the brakes.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{stop it! you're scaring the fuck out of me!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{okay. okay. fuck!}
<A>__{chet makes the sign of the cross.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i'm cool now.}
<A>__{will continues driving. chet discreetly unlocks the passenger side door.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i saw you.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{it's in case i have to jump out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{if i survive the day, and you don't because you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck, i'm gonna laugh my ass off.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{and if abandoning ship saves my life, then that laugh will be mine.}
<A>__{the guys continue driving in silence. super countdown: 6 hours, 59 minutes...}
