<A>__{half the audience is already on its feet. the kill is imminent and they love it. jake lands one blow after another. he is relentless. several rows back, tommy como, salvy and several other "made" guys sit with sober looks on their faces. jake moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes janiro's nose plastering it against his left cheek. the final bell rings. janiro, his legs all rubber, staggers back to his corner. jake prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to the crowd. joey rushes out, throws jake's leopard skin robe over him and embraces him. tony follows. jake looks right at como and salvy. an announcer steps into the center of the ring:}
