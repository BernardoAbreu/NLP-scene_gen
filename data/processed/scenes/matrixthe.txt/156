<L>__{interior presidential suite (matrix) day}
<A>__{agent smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite, staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering with brilliant sunlight.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{have you ever stood and stared at it, morpheus? marveled at its beauty. its genius. billions of people just living out their lives... oblivious.}
<A>__{agent brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a hypodermic needle.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{did you know that the first matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. it was a disaster. no one would accept the program. entire crops were lost.}
<A>__{agent brown jams the needle into morpheus' shoulder, and plunges down.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.}
<A>__{agent brown studies the screens as the life signs react violently to the injection.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was re designed to this: the peak of your civilization.}
<A>__{he turns from the window.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{i say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about.}
<A>__{he sits down directly in front of morpheus.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{evolution, morpheus. evolution.}
<A>__{he lifts morpheus' head.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{like the dinosaur. look out that window. you had your time.}
<A>__{morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the pain racking his mind.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{the future is our world, morpheus. the future is our time.}
