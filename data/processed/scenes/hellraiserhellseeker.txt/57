<L>__{interior larry ellis' office day}
<A>__{larry ellis is a somber but handsome young attorney. at present he at his desk poring through several books on child custody law. he makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{basically they know where your wife's body is and they're not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess? yet neither of them has come out and told you that you're a suspect. is that what you're trying to say?}
<A>__{trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a chair so big it practically swallows him whole.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{look larry i know you never thought too much of me. and i know this all sounds a little fucked up.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{a little? try unbelievably.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. i think they got a hold of my e mail address at work too.}
<A>__{larry is not buying this for a nanosecond. he trims some brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. but this wasn't murder it was an accident }
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(concentrating on his notes)}
<D>__{and as far as hiding a body goes? i find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. it's absolutely preposterous. now i'm not saying i don't believe you, i'm....ambiguous. there's quite alot of money behind all this.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{how much do i stand to inherit if kirsty is presumed dead?}
<A>__{larry sighs and walks over to his desk. he presses a button on his intercom.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{rosie can you bring in the gooding papers?}
<C>__{assistant's voice}
<P>__{(from intercom)}
<D>__{right away mr. ellis.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{uh. ballpark would be fine larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{in the vicinity of eight million four hundred fifty thousand. or is it sixty }
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what happens if i'm convicted of kirsty's murder?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing }
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{please larry. pretend you like me and humor me.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{seeing you were her sole benefactor, and i'm the executive of the will, kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hello? city? cops? it's a fucking conspiracy!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{pardon my glibness trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. the next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. you're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{thanks for your concern larry. and fuck you too.}
<A>__{trevor gets up and heads for the door.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(to trevor's back)}
<D>__{i never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer. but marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did!}
<A>__{on his way out trevor nearly runs down larry's assistant who was just coming in with a large file. trevor's gone.}
