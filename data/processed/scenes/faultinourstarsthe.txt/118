<T>__{she remembers:}
<A>__{ the magical dinner at oranjee. the bench in which they sat overlooking the water. the passionate kiss in anne frank's house. falling onto the bed together. [all of these are images we saw at the beginning of the movie, only now, we see the oxygen tank, we see gus's leg, we see the fumbling and the difficulties etc. they don't make these images less beautiful. they make them twice as beautiful because they're real.]}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{i love her, god i love her. i'm so lucky to love her, van houten.}
<C>__{gus's voice }
<D>__{you don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a say in who hurts you.}
<A>__{ and back on hazel in the grass. she holds the letter to her chest. a single tear falls onto her cheeks.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{i like my choices. i hope she likes hers.}
<A>__{hazel closes her eyes.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{ok, hazel grace?}
<A>__{a beat. another. hazel opens her eyes. and she says to the universe:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{black.}
