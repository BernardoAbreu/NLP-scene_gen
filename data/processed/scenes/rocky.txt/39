<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{ain't skated since i was fifteen that's when i started fightin' gotta watch the ankles. yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. all i wanted to prove was i weren't no bum that i had the stuff to make a good pro.}

<A>__{the cleaner yells from the sideline.}
<C>__{cleaner}
<D>__{nine minutes!}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{hey, i ain't cryin'... i still fight. kinda do it like a hobby. see i'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward southpaw means lefthanded... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{but you never had a chance to prove yourself.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{cleaner}
