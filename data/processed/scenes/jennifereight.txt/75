<L>__{75: interior apartment. dusk.}
<A>__{berlin has moved to the sofa. a shaft of dead sunlight crosses the apartment. helena comes in making a brave face of it. does n't realize he's moved. "i'm here, helena." and she smiles and changes direction. puts the coffee tray on a table in front of him. no music now and all sounds in close up. close on the lip of the coffee pot as she pours. close on the cup she gives him. everything close in helena's world or her world wouldn't exist.}
