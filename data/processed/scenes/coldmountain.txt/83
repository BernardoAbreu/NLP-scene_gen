<L>__{exterior a bluff. night}
<A>__{inman walks a rocky track, falling away to the river at one side, a steep cliff to the other, the way itself broken and precarious, bad country to meet an enemy. inman sees a light in the distance, a torch flicking in and out of view, like a star to follow. he stops, narrows his eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. he pulls out the lemats. a man, all in black, a horse in tow, is at the edge of the}
<B>__{gorge.}
<A>__{the horse has a burden a sack or wrapped bundle draped over either side of the saddle. the attempts to heave the bundle onto his shoulders. he can't, and the bundle slips to the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head. it is the body of a black girl. the man tries again to lift her. he's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. he staggers with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep gorge. he kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling to her. he's at the edge now and can just let her go. then inman's gun is at his temple.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{don't let go. just back up, nice and steady, do this all in reverse, you're going to end up with her draped back over your animal.}

<D>__{don't pull that trigger. i am a man of god.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i've killed several of them.}

<C>__{inman}
<D>__{what part of god's business is throwing a woman down a gorge.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{a slave woman, can you see that in this light? she's black as a bucket of tar.}
<A>__{he's retreating, on his way back to the horse.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{is she dead?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{drugged her. like you would a butterfly. and i care for her, that's the heartbreak of it.}
<A>__{he has the girl back on the horse. inman brings the torch up to his face. it's tear stained.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{she's got my bastard in her belly. what kind of pistol is that i never saw the like of it?}
