<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house morning}
<D>__{day breaks. hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of adobe, in the southern deserts of morocco, carrying a satchel and a large bundle wrapped in cloth. he walks past a corral made out of branches, where several goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.}
<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house continuous}
<D>__{abdullah (40), opens.}
<C>__{hassan}
<P>__{(in arabic)}
<D>__{good morning abdullah... i brought you this... he holds up the bundle.}
<L>__{interior yussef and ahmed's house moments later}
<D>__{abdullah's family is inside the house. there is a room, a small table and a simple kitchen. yasira (38) is roasting some goat meat assisted by yamil (16) and zora (17), her daughters. abdullah and his sons, yussef (13) and ahmed (14), are sitting on the floor around the small table, looking at a well conserved .270 caliber winchester 60 rifle.}
<C>__{hassan}
<P>__{(to abdullah)}
<D>__{it's almost new. he takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{three hundred cartridges... he opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{the hunter who gave it to me said you can hit up to three kilometers away.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{how much do you want for everything?}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{one thousand dirhams.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{one thousand dirhams? i will give you one thousand and a goat. abdullah and hassan exchange a look and hassan smiles.}
<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house day}
<D>__{hassan and abdullah's family are behind the house. hassan stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards away and he turns toward abdullah.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{with this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals. he aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly. it is clear that he doesn't know how to fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. the rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder. the bullet flies far wide of the rock. the women laugh nervously. rubbing his shoulder, hassan turns to abdullah.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{let one of your sons shoot. abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{let yussef shoot. when hassan is about to hand yussef the rifle, ahmed cuts him off, upset.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i want to shoot first. father and son exchange an angry glance. hassan, without realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to ahmed. the boy grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{look, load it like this. hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes it. once it is loaded, he points at the safety.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{this is the safety. push it in when you're ready. ahmed nods. unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and, almost without aiming, fires. the shot kicks up dust far from the rock. his sisters laugh.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{if he doesn't hit the jackals, at least he'll scare the shit out of them. ahmed lowers the rifle. his father grabs it and gives it to yussef enthusiastically.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{your turn. yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. he lifts the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. he seems innately skilled at the maneuver. he shoots and the bullet hits just below the rock. abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to hassan.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better than you.}
<L>__{exterior goat corral later}
<D>__{yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and gives it to hassan. abdullah supervises. yasira approaches and gives abdullah a bag.}
<C>__{yasira}
<D>__{your lunch. abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{you better kill at least three jackals.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{and make sure no one sees you with the rifle, hide it if you see someone approach you. ahmed nods. abdullah and hassan go on their way.}
<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house later}
<D>__{yasira and yamil are far from the house, cleaning some goatskins stretched out on some branches. ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate and enters to herd them out. he calls his brother.}

<D>__{yussef, yussef...}
<L>__{exterior side wall, yussef and ahmed's house continuous}
<D>__{yussef is squatting on the other side of the house, spying through a crack, breathing excitedly.}
<L>__{interior yussef and ahmed's house continuous}
<D>__{zora is inside, undressing. she has a long body and her cinnamon skin is soft and clean. every now and then she aims a complicit glance at the crack through which yussef is spying.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{yussef... zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from.}
<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house day}
<D>__{yussef is still spying. ahmed approaches.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{what are you doing? yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{i told you not to spy on her again. yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. ahmed pulls him by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. yussef falls on his ass.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{i said don't spy on her. yussef gets up and dusts himself off.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{what the hell do you care?}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{come on, let's go. he turns around and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<D>__{the goats graze. yussef and ahmed watch them sitting on the side of a hill. they look hot and bored. they both throw stones at a small rusty can. yussef throws one and misses. ahmed throws his and does. he draws a line in the ground.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{five to two. a jackal is stalking the goats. yussef spots it.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{there's a jackal over there. ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. yussef points at it, but ahmed still cannot locate it. yussef despairs.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{over there. ahmed finally spots it. he loads the rifle, but when he is about to aim, the rifle fires. the shot hits amidst the goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{what are you doing, you idiot? the jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in different directions.}
<L>__{exterior desert later}
<D>__{both brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and drinking water from a goatskin canteen.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{zora doesn't mind. ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{she doesn't, but i do.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{this is between her and me.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{you're both pigs. next time i'm going to tell my dad.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{stay out of this.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{if you want me to stay out of it, don't do it. yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<D>__{the brothers are sitting apart from each other. ahmed guards the goats with the rifle on his lap. after a while, yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. he makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants down to start masturbating.}
<A>__{when he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and startles him. he quickly pulls his pants up and another shot rings out. yussef gets up to see what his brother is doing. ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards away. he fires a third time. yussef runs up to him.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the distance.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{hassan said that it could hit things three kilometers away, but it can't even reach that rock over there.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{that's because you don't know how to shoot. give me the rifle.}
<A>__{ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle over. yussef aims and fires. the shot echoes through the vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{see, it can't reach it.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{give me another bullet.}
<A>__{yussef aims and fires. the bullet hits the rock and kicks up a lot of whitish dust.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{see.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yeah, but that's not three kilometers.}
<A>__{ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the top of the hill. once at the top, he looks around for a moment and then calls his brother.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{yussef, come here.}
<A>__{yussef climbs the slope. ahmed signals a road that in the distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{i bet you the bullet can't hit that far away.}
<A>__{ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign. he fires and nothing.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{these fucking bullets aren't any good.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{you're not aiming right.}
<A>__{yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{what'll you give me if i hit that car?}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i will shoot.}
<A>__{ahmed reloads. the empty cartridge falls to the ground. he fires again the car keeps going. yussef asks for the rifle.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{you see? nothing happens.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{let me shoot.}
<A>__{he also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and shoots the traffic sign. he fires and nothing.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i told you. hassan's a liar.}
<A>__{a bus approaches. ahmed points at it.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{shoot at that one...}
<A>__{yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber, raises the weapon, aims and fires. the bus drives on. ahmed turns to his brother.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{see: nothing.}

<D>__{they saved him?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: i want to thank you for saving me, but i can't change and i'm going to keep hunting you. the little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. but we will always save you, because that's who we are.}

<D>__{i'm sorry. is there something you wanted to tell me? chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. kenji takes off his shoes and leaves them at the door. chieko leads him to the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything to drink.}

<D>__{do you have tea? chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. kenji glances over the apartment. chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. a small bulb lights. kenji just watches her. chieko gestures for him to sit down. kenji and chieko sit across from each other. chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down and hands it over to kenji. kenji reads, seems surprised and reads again slowly.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{"my father had nothing to do with my mother's death," what's this? chieko is disconcerted at the question. she takes her notebook and starts writing. kenji reads and turns to her.}

<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{no, your father isn't going to jail. we just need to talk to him.}

<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{what are you doing? she doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches away from him. she is almost panting. she holds out her hand and caresses kenji's ear. he stands there, immobile, without taking his eyes off chieko's. she takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. kenji strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. she grabs it again and puts it back on.}
<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{no, no, no... this is wrong. kenji looks turned on and confused: chieko is beautiful, but he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.}

<C>__{kenji }
<D>__{enough, please. he grabs her by her arms and moves her away. she grabs the sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. she hugs him and suddenly chieko starts crying, disconsolate. kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing chieko's despair, holds her. she buries her face in his shoulder. her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.}
