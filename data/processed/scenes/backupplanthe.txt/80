<C>__{joan }
<D>__{all of our friends in new york, they thought we'd lost our minds.}

<C>__{joan }
<D>__{i guess i'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction. you just have to be open to it.}
<A>__{stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse. he shrugs.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{having a baby with someone i barely know, someone else's baby...it's just not how i pictured it.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i used to work on wall street. now i wear boots covered in goat shit. this isn't how i pictured it, either. but guess what...i'm happy.}
