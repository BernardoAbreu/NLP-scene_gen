<A>__{the approaching overpass. j.f.k. waves... mrs. connally turns to j.f.k. the shot is crazy, fractured, surreal.}

<D>__{mr. president, you can't say that dallas doesn't love you.}
<C>__{jfk }
<D>__{no, you certainly can't.}
<A>__{then we hear the shots: the volley sounds like a motorcycle backfire. we catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke. we see a view from the street of the texas school book depository all in line with the "official" version of events. pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof. then the screen goes gray as did cbs tv's first bulletins to the country.}

<D>__{we interrupt this program to bring you this flash bulletin. a burst of gunfire! three bursts of gunfire, apparently from automatic weapons, were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas.}
<A>__{we hear voices under this from everywhere, colliding in confusion and horror:}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{oh no! my god they're going to kill us all! be still. you're going to be all right. let's get out of here. we're hit! lawson, this is kellerman. we are hit. get us to the hospital immediately. pull out of the motorcade. take us to the nearest hospital.}
<C>__{jackie kennedy voice}
<D>__{oh, no, they've shot jack... i love you, jack... jack... they've killed my husband...}
<C>__{cbs bulletin }
<D>__{the first reports say that president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting. more details just arrived. united press say the wounds to president kennedy perhaps could be fatal. repeating: president kennedy has been shot by a would be assassin in dallas. three bursts of gunfire, apparently from automatic weapons...}

<D>__{it came from there. secure that area behind the fence. it's that building up there.}
<A>__{we hear sirens and screeching tires. the screen is still gray, randomly intercut with the end of the nix film showing the car escaping. there are wildly tracking shots of the crowd running towards the grassy knoll. the camera pans up the little set of stairs. we see more faces. someone in a suit stops our camera. secret service? we see the briefest glimpse from the zapruder film. the camera moves in on the open umbrella next, then to the freeway sign, then to mrs. kennedy out of the car reaching for help, then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender. the car finally speeds away. the people on the other side of the underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell. (these are fragmented, mystifying shots. the main effect is one of blackout of not knowing; of being in the dark, as we all were back then.)}
