<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{that son of a bitch.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that'd be my reaction too }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{he's lying.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well, why didn't you say so? we'll just drop all your charges, then }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i'm serious }
<A>__{hardy leans across the table.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{fuck "you're serious", raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{did kendall tell you about the px?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{he said he worked there }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no, did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what business?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{pills, shots, you name it, basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{so childs made some side money, so what? people are dead, ray, and the only one we have to blame is you }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{didn't shoot west }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{yeah, we know, pike did.}
<A>__{dunbar stares at him.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you think you know everything, don't you? you haven't even scratched the surface.}
<A>__{hardy leans across the table, looks dunbar dead in the eye.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i know enough to know you got two choices you can sign a confession, in which case you'll probably spend the rest of your life in a military prison, or you can tell us to fuck off, in which case you'll probably get the gas chamber.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{am i scratching your surface yet?}
<A>__{dunbar stares at him for a moment and then launches himself at hardy, screaming. tackles him to the floor, choking him... osborne, pulling her sidearm, and pistol whipping dunbar in the head! dunbar goes sprawling off hardy as m.p.'s rush into the room, restraining him. hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{hardy!}
<A>__{but he's already gone.}
