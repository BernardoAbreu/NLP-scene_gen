<L>__{73c she is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came. as she}
<A>__{reaches an intersection with a cross corridor a white clad figure blurs from that corridor. the orderly hits her in a flying tackle. she skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling. the other two orderlies leap into the fray.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no! help me! goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!!}
<A>__{she is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is coming. they grab her thrashing arms and legs. they don't even look where the out of control woman is pointing... back along the corridor. they have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her. silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of trank. sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of terminator coming up behind them. it is exactly her nightmare. she screams in utter hopelessness. terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand. he hurls the 200 pound guys against the far wall of the corridor. smack! he drops to the floor. the other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder. terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys. then there is an explosion of white clad figures, as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine. one crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two story fall by the outer steel bars. the other crashes through an office door, splintering it into kindling. silberman has jumped to hold sarah. he is grabbed by a roll of skin at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat. the doctor feel his feet pedaling above the ground. he looks into the expressionless face. and it hit him. sarah was right... this guy isn't human. he feels the fabric of reality crumbling. then he feels himself flying through the air. the wall smacks him, then the floor kicks him in the face. he decides to lie there a second. sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her. john kneels next to her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mom, are you okay?}
<A>__{she looks from terminator to john. back to terminator. is this a nightmare? or has she finally gone truly bad? incredibly, terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering to help her up. the last thing she ever expected to see.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{come with me if you want to live.}
<A>__{the orderlies are stirring.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's all right, mom. he's here to help.}
<A>__{sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers. terminator lifts her to her feet.}
