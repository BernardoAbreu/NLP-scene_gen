<L>__{exterior dussander's back porch day}
<A>__{title: october 1984 it is late afternoon. dussander sits in a rocking chair facing out into the backyard. todd is in the lawn chair off to the side. he has just finished a mcdonald's cheeseburger and is about to start another one. dussander eats a big mac, washing it down with bourbon. a large cat keeps jumping onto dussander's lap while he is eating. he brushes it away annoyed.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i've never seen anyone drink bourbon with mcdonald's before. ...so, how did the stuff get to patin?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{in railroad cars marked "medical supplies." it came in long crates that looked like coffins.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's fitting. was it always zyklon b?}
<A>__{the cat jumps into dussander's lap again. he throws it down, this time harder.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no, from time to time we would be sent something else. experimental gases. the high command was always interested in improving efficiency. once they sent us a gas code named "pegasus." a nerve gas. thank god they never sent it again. it...}
<A>__{todd sits up a little, leaning in.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it what?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it didn't work very well. it was quite boring.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{bullshit. you're lying. what did it do?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it killed them. what do you think it did, made them walk on water? it killed them.}
<A>__{the cat jumps up a third time. this time dussander picks it up and tosses it a good six feet. the animal hits the ground and runs away.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{tell me.}
<P>__{(slurps on his coke)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i won't. i refuse. where are my cigarettes?}
<A>__{he finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips. he lights it. todd watches calmly, giving the old man a moment to collect himself, and then...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what did it do?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it made them dance.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{dance?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{like zyklon b, it came in through the shower heads. after a few seconds the prisoners began to leap about. some were screaming. most of them were laughing. they began to vomit and to... to defecate helplessly.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you mean they... they... shit themselves? ...woah.}
<A>__{but dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he begins to remember more easily.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{they began to twitch all over and make high, strange sounds in their throats. at last they collapsed and just lay there on the concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood streaming from their noses. but i lied to you, boy. it didn't kill them. either because it wasn't strong enough or because we couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long. i suppose it was that. i sent five men in with rifles to end their agonies. these were five men i trusted. it would have looked bad on my record to have wasted so many cartridges at a time when the fuehrer had declared every cartridge a national resource. i was always given high marks for efficiency.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, i bet.}
<A>__{dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap. as if his own story has suddenly disgusted him, he balls the food up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{how do you eat this crap everyday?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why didn't you just do the job yourself? you carried a gun, didn't you?}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{i was the commandant of the camp.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so you never killed anybody?}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(getting frustrated)}
<D>__{the entire world was at war, boy. people died.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's not a real answer. i'm asking about you .}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, i was a soldier in a position of power. you don't get to be there by selling ...girl scout's cookies.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i know what the ss was, dussander. who are you talking to? it was a bunch of dumb, rich kids who bought their way into the service so they wouldn't have to go fight on the front.}
<A>__{dussander stares at todd, wanting to say something. todd shovels a few more fries into his mouth, then looks up and sees dussander eyeing him.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{that's enough for today, boy. i beg you. i'm tired.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, fine. that was good story though. you always tell them good, once i get you started.}
<A>__{angle on dussander. dussander's dream #1 : exterior open field day dussander is asleep in his bed. a low groaning sound comes in very slowly. dussander's eyes open. he sits up, looks around, sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field. it is grassy, but certainly not beautiful. something is wrong about this place. he stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas. but it is cold. he takes the sheet and wraps himself in it. the groaning is getting louder, more human. we have never seen him frightened, until now. he steps a few paces from the bed. the groans have becomes low screams. there is no where to go. slowly, as if he knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground. it's just grass. but the human voices are now wailing desperately. his knees buckle, but he tries to fight it. he reaches his knees and lowers his head toward the ground. the white sheet flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind. the screams are now at a feverish pitch. his ear is inches from the grass and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open as...}
