<L>__{ext piazza navona night}
<A>__{piazza navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so much attention directed toward the vatican. the hood of a car glides into view, nearly silent, on the far side of the fountain. langdon and the two roman cops step out and survey the area. langdon looks to the fountain. its central core is twenty feet tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through which water churns. atop it stands an obelisk that climbs another forty feet.}

<D>__{blame mussolini. he wanted it for his summer }
<A>__{but the cop stops mid sentence as he notices the black van parked on the far side of the fountain. silently, the cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways around the fountain, and to langdon to stay where he is. langdon, frustrated but no action hero, watches them as they slowly encircle the van. at the driver's side, the first cop approaches the driver's window, sees mr. gray sitting implacably behind the wheel. he taps lightly with a knuckle, his drawn gun at his side, just out of view. mr. gray opens the window.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{si?}
<A>__{the roman cop looks down, ever so briefly, at a small spreading bloodstain on mr. gray's shirt. when he looks back up there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him.}
<B>__{phoom.}
<A>__{he takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the window, and from a distance, we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's window. whole thing took about three seconds. diners at an outdoor cafe don't even notice. from langdon's point of view, on the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he can't see anything out of the ordinary. he turns, looks to the second cop, who is just now approaching from the rear of the van. with the second cop, this one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything. we creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes around to where he can see the driver's side the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead. a quick exchange in italian:}

<A>__{another bullet, another slumping cop, and from langdon's point of view, the van rocks again, but he can't see anything more detailed than that. all he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the other side of the van, something is going on and the bell in the clock tower starts to bong. even unarmed, langdon starts to move forward, just as the sliding door on the fountain side of the van slams open revealing the figure of the fourth cardinal, wrapped in chains and with manacled hands and feet. he thrashes against the iron links, but the chains are too heavy. one of the links bisects his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help. mr. gray hovers over him. langdon gasps and mr. gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van. the cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous splash. his weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom. there is a moment, frozen in time, in which langdon locks eyes with mr. gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock tower continues to bong, the only sound we can hear. langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then back up at mr. gray who salutes him the van door slams shut, and the van tears ass out of there. langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all. langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides and leaps in. in the fountain, the water is waist deep and like ice. steady streams of bubbles rise up from the bottom, churning it. langdon reaches the body of the cardinal, plunges in underwater, and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man. through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded with the final ambigram:}
<C>__{water.}
<A>__{langdon struggles to lift him, but the weight is too much, he can barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain, much less all the way to the surface. langdon, running out of air, bursts to the surface and on the surface, takes a deep breath, then plunges back underwater, but he still can't move the cardinal. he makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting his fate, maybe even welcoming it. langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air supply. but with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the cardinal a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles into the fountain. he goes back }
<B>__{above the surface}
<A>__{ takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising up to the surface just above the tube. air! several passers by notice the commotion in the fountain as langdon dives back under the water. underwater, langdon drags the body of the cardinal a few feet across the bottom of the fountain and rips the tube free from its mooring, pulling it to the cardinal's mouth. he clamps it down over the man's lips, and the cardinal sucks a few greedy breaths from it. enough to keep him alive. langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then digs his hands back underneath the cardinal to lift him, but this time six more hands come in from all sides. several passers by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as they all strain together on the surface, the cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he gulps deep lungfuls of air. he is saved. langdon sags against the side of the fountain, exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the cardinal's body to safety. in the distance, sirens. langdon, gathering himself, goes to the cardinal, speaks in rapid spanish, subtitled.}
