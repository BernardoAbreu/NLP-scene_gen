<L>__{interior tyler's apartment building hallway later}
<A>__{tyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in his pocket for his keys. he sings the inuit song to himself...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum...}
<A>__{his front door is unlocked. tyler freezes. takes a beat. scans the room, silently dropping his bag. he reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door. wielding it, he takes two steps into the apartment. craig, in plain clothes, sitting on tyler's bed, amidst the carnage of tyler's stuff. he has been rifling through everything. the guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall. craig looks up. the men lock eyes. craig's eyes go to the bat. tyler leans it slowly against the wall. beat.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what are you doing in my house?}
<A>__{craig's eyes flash.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{where's my daughter?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{she's not here now. she's at the library.}
<A>__{craig's face says it: "bullshit".}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{does she know?}
<A>__{cops never ask a question they don't know the answer to.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i didn't think so. i figured you'd probably leave that up to me when you're done with her.}
<A>__{craig's face, like his wife's so many years ago, is pure contempt. with his body at this angle, tyler can now see his gun.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{that's true, tyler roth, son of charles and diane. brother of caroline and michael, deceased, suicide by hanging. you're kinda lost, aren't you? taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i'm the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag.}
<A>__{craig closes the distance. from tyler's p.o.v he looks like a freight train. in a flash, he gets tyler in a choke hold, flips him on his back on the bed and puts his hands around tyler's throat. silence, except for exertion. tyler's hands are on craig's wrists. he is holding craig's eye. his face is starting to turn colors. beat. beat.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{she needs you.}
<A>__{it travels between the two men. craig grappling with it, although he still has his hands at tyler's throat. craig drops his hands, pushes himself off tyler tyler rolls to one side, coughing and gagging. craig leans against the wall for support. he is trying, before our eyes, to pull the shards of himself together. his gun visible at his waistband. tyler's coughing, his face still red, his eyes travel briefly to the bat, then to craig. craig closes his eyes, very briefly, then rises. not looking at tyler. beat. looking at tyler. beat. craig goes to the front door.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{get a fucking dead bolt.}
<A>__{slam. and then he's gone. the door bounces in its frame. and then it's just tyler trying to remember how to breathe.}
