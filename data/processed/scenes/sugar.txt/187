<A>__{unable to sleep, miguel lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, when he overhears a commotion from across the hall. after a beat, he hears a door open and slam shut. he goes to the door, listens close. it's quiet, until...}

<P>__{(handing him the bag)}
<D>__{love, keep this in your room for me. just a few hours. til morning. i will be back.}
<A>__{she forces the bag into his hands, kisses him on the cheek, and retreats into her own room. miguel closes the door, still holding the bag. he sets it on his bed, stares at it. after a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs it under the bed, out of sight. he sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears shouting from the hall. again, he goes to the door, listens. another man pounds on raquel's door, screaming in ukrainian, while nikolai yells at the man in english, though miguel can't make out exactly what's going on. the shouting intensifies until a scuffle breaks out. a woman screams. miguel reaches for the door handle, but stops himself. he steps into his bathroom, shuts the door, sits on the toilet. the muffled shouting continues. miguel waits.}
