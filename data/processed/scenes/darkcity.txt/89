<L>__{interior bath house}
<A>__{bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels and swimming outfits, waiting silently. they sit lined by a wall, staring into space. bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam. he walks beside a heated pool naked people swim about weakly or sit on the edge washing themselves. he steps up to a fully dressed man, sitting silently on a bench. it is white. a feint smile brushes across white's lips as he looks up at the inspector. he looks away, like he's forgotten something. stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down, scoops some water. bumstead sees white has picked up the little silver fish.}
