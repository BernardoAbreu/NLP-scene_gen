<L>__{interior stargher's world the idealized cell}
<A>__{more stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately decorated, with the atmosphere of a church. individual images hang like shrines, each showing julia hickson from different angles. central to the room is a window into the cell itself. where we find a beautiful, mermaid like julia hickson floating in water. peaceful, joyous. in the center of the room, we find novak and catherine, she holding the hand of young stargher, he stunned at the sight of julia. the child looks at catherine with beatific, sad eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{where the hell are we?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{carl, do you know? like on a map...}
<A>__{he shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay. you helped so much already. i'm proud of you.}
<A>__{as a frustrated novak searches for anything identifying, catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad, haunted eyes.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{carl, i think i can help you. would you like that? even if peter can't find julia, i want to help you.}
<A>__{the boy leans against her and she caresses his face.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque reading carver industrial equipment, with a logo. novak recognizes it from the hoist in stargher's basement.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{he pulls her to her feet. feeling betrayed and rejected, the child breaks away from her. the roar of stargher king shakes the cell. terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{carl!}
<A>__{novak feels what's coming.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i can't leave him!}
<A>__{stargher king appears! his throat wounded, bloody mess, he descends out of dark nothingness, howling with rage. he reaches for catherine, but young stargher runs in front of her. stargher king clamps his massive arms around the child! little carl opens his mouth in a silent scream... catherine's arms reach out to him, but novak clasps her hand and presses. and she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...}
