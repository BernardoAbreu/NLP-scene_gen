<L>__{interior car. day}
<A>__{dignan and applejack are sitting in, a '72 monte carlo by the curb two houses down from bob's. applejack is a small black man with white hair. it's hard to tell exactly how old he is. around sixty five.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{there's a lot of valuable shit in there, applejack. the silver and the china. the crystal. and the grandfather clock. goddammit, i bet that clock's worth ten grand.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? it doesn't make any goddamn sense.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{just settling an old score. you might say revenge.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{that sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{we might have to take that chance. cause i feel pretty strongly about this.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{is that buckethead?}
<A>__{anthony is walking hector down the driveway.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{get down.}
<A>__{anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{is that him?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{wait a second.}
<A>__{they watch anthony and hector start down the street.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{that's anthony.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{that's your friend anthony?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{what's he doing here?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{looks like he's staying with buckethead. that's what i figured. he's probably got his own room. let's see where he's going.}
<A>__{applejack puts the car in gear. they drive slowly.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{don't get too close.}
<A>__{anthony looks back.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{stop. he saw us.}
<A>__{anthony keeps jogging with hector.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{wait. did he see us?}
<C>__{applejack}
<D>__{we're going too slow. it looks like we're following him.}
<A>__{anthony goes around a corner, down an alley.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{speed up.}
<A>__{they pull down to the end of the alley. anthony and hector are racing down the alley.}
