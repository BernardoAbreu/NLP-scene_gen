<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg and sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not working. sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing again. finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the clover leaf seal on the portal. she unfolds it, twists it. the portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source directly through to the exterior of the house. she bends down and looks through it. it's covered by a metal mesh at the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside through it. she sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her. she does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of the tube, gulping fresh air greedily. meg looks at sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor at the portal and suck air. it's temporary, but it works.}
