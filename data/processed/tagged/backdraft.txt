<A>__{darkness. then the glint of a flashlight. its beam rocks crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room as we hear two children arguing.}
<C>__{older kid}
<D>__{you're doing it wrong.}
<C>__{younger kid}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{older kid}
<D>__{you're doing it wrong.}
<A>__{it's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light. huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons. bent, stained helmets hung like african masks. beneath them brian, 7, and stephen, 12, are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{it doesn't go like that.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{who asked you?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{if you do it like that it'll open in the fire. then you'll get burned and die.}
<A>__{the door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. it's a fire station storage room full of fire gear. a fireman stands in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; dennis mccaffrey.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{who's going to die?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{brian. he's not doing it right, dad. he never does it right.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(gestures for them to come out)}
<D>__{well, let's have a look.}
<L>__{interior fire station 17 day}
<A>__{the two boys tromp out of the closet. the rubber turn out boots are as high as their thighs. the ends of the coats drag on the floor. they salute, brian's arm just an empty sleeve. dennis kneels down and re fastens brian's coat.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{your brother's right. if you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{and die!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you wouldn't let me die, would you, dad?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{mccaffreys are smarter than fire, brian.}

<D>__{fireman shit?}

<D>__{never fails...}
<A>__{a young fireman, adcox, appears with the dispatch card.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{big deal?}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{medium deal.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{want to come along, brian? watch the old man earn his keep?}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you've come along a dozen times, stephen, give your brother a chance. we'll be back in a few minutes.}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{how 'bout it, sport?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{sure!}
<A>__{dennis scoops brian up and loads him into the fire engine cab. the other three firemen climb aboard and take their places.}
<L>__{exterior fire station 17 day}
<A>__{there's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine is pulling out of the station.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{hit the button, brian.}
<A>__{brian stamps his foot on the siren button. the red light snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down the street. brian turns around in his seat and, at the last instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older brother. they stick their tongues out.}
<L>__{exterior chicago street day 20 yrs. earlier}
<A>__{the engine howls its way through the city. brian, sandwiched between his father and adcox, looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.}
<L>__{exterior building day 20 yrs. earlier}
<A>__{lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. medium deal. the engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping off like ship rats. dennis opens his door, hops down, and pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his son.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{stay near the truck.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{and keep an eye out for us, huh? we're short handed today.}
<A>__{brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. dennis smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward a doorway they disappear into. brian climbs down from the cab.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{don't stray too far, little man.}
<A>__{brian smiles to the pumper operator. he just wants a better look. and he gets it: smoke turned evil and dark now, taking on purpose.}
<L>__{exterior building day 20 yrs. earlier}
<A>__{there's a level of apartments above the storefronts. as brian watches, a window opens and out steps his father and adcox onto a small fire escape. their attention's on the next window over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke. suddenly dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and jumps across to the next metal balcony. a ballsy, dangerous move. he kicks in the window, breaks out the frame with his axe, and dives in. a beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl. he hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way a ladder. dennis's face lifts and grins at brian; dirty, bigger than life, invincible. he winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling darkness. as brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. the flame seems to pause, to stare at brian a beat. shhh, don't tell anyone. brian is transfixed, his little head staring up in astonishment. nobody else has noticed it. brian can see his father and adcox through the window; probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. brian starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{dad...}
<A>__{he tries to call louder... but suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion: brian can see adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as dennis suddenly throws his body against adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame explodes downward from the ceiling fully against him as all the building's windows blow out and it's like the sky's erupted for brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him. plaster, wood, and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly. a fire helmet. and adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{get us some backup! we need some goddamn backup!}
<A>__{and, spotting brian, he runs towards him. and the helmet spins and spins and adcox keeps running, and the sky is raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we read the printing on the neck guard.}
<B>__{mccaffrey}
<A>__{and adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like brian doesn't see him. he pulls away from adcox, walks up to his father's helmet, and puts it on. the scene explodes with a flash as a photographer captures the instant.}

<L>__{interior brian's car day}
<A>__{hold on the freeze frame. let it become an aged cover of life. the magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's sitting atop a box of knick knacks jostling in the back seat of an aging bmw. there's plenty of other boxes here, a live on the move, and in the driver's seat, brian mccaffrey, now}
<L>__{27. there's piles of empty burger wrappers, coke cans, and}
<A>__{florida knick knacks on the dash board; a little blow up palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "mccaffrey high end stereo sales".}

<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<D>__{is this a joke?}
<A>__{brian's sitting in the seat opposite.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{if it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.}
<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<D>__{you walked out on this academy six years ago. one week to graduation. you think we forgot that? you think i did?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i want another shot, sir.}
<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, everybody remembers your old man. being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. dead hero father rule. but you blew us off. why should i take you back?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{if you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top }
<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<D>__{ i don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i need another one, sir.}
<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<D>__{sorry, but it's out of my hands. try again next year.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. if i push you have to let me back in. dead hero father rule. sir.}
<C>__{chief fitzgerald}
<P>__{(simmers)}
<D>__{even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. that's hard duty, son. if you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.}

<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure that i certify that candidate class number 322, having successfully completed all academy requirements, are hereby graduated to the chicago fire department.}
<A>__{candidates and their relatives cheer and leap to their feet. something struggles inside of brian. he doesn't stand at first. another candidate, tim, 20, looks at him strangely. so does the academy chief, his eyes finding brian's. and brian's standing slowly now, joining them...}

<A>__{an expensive one. we hear a window break.}

<A>__{the candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming to each other: "all right! engine 117! that's a slum! they get cookers every day!". "oh no, engine 10, that's a nice neighborhood"... willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a stack of business cards.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{really. well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". i always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "assistant director, sales, aspen snowmobile tours..."}
