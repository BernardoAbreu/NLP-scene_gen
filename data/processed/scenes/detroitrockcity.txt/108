<A>__{we find trip counting his money out to the little kid, chongo, and their two buds.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{...hundred forty, hundred fifty. that's all i got.}
<A>__{the little kid puts the money in his pocket.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{tsk. tsk. tsk. i really wanted things to work out for you, my weasly, dim witted friend. you got spunk.}
<P>__{(to chongo)}
<D>__{chongo, give him a fifty dollar wallop.}
<A>__{chongo reels back and...}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{oh, no... please, look. i...}
<A>__{thwam! right in trip's face. trip flies off his feet into the smiley mart brick wall with a thud. a bag of weed drops from his jacket, then some uppers, a few sheets of acid, and finally a can of beer rolls out.}
<C>__{chongo}
<D>__{hey, the jerkoff's got drugs.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{consider it a bonus, chongo.}
<A>__{chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two buds scoop it all up. the little kid, chongo, and the buds leave trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood. he pulls out stretch armstrong and looks at him fondly.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(misty eyed)}
<D>__{at least i still got you, stretch.}
<A>__{trip looks up. the six year olds who he stole it from stand close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange. licked, trip tosses the doll to them. they both dash away with it, giggling.}
