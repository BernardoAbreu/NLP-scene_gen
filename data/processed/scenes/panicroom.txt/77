<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{in the panic room, meg is sitting cross legged on the floor, leaning against a wall, but sarah is in motion, sorting through shelves, opening drawers. every drawer has something in it, sealed under plastic. she opens and closes, sorts and lifts finds the following: waterproof matches and lighters. flashlights. unopened packages of batteries. sealed water bags stamped "pure five years from date." tinned food. flares. pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are stamped fireproof blanket). a complete tool kit. as sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level. it's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a four pronged cloverlike seal. the portal is closed tight, as sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it resists her attempts to crank it open. meg notices.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{hey. relax, okay?}
<A>__{but sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal, then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden switch that controls it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i mean it, lie down. you get your adrenaline up and you know what's gonna happen.}
<A>__{sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan, huddled in the corner.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{are you freaking out?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{little bit. yeah.}
<A>__{sarah looks around the room.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{small space?}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(nods, fast)}
<D>__{don't though.}
<P>__{(talk about it, that is)}
<A>__{sarah looks at her, thinks. it's not an unfamiliar situation, her needing to comfort her mother.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why did the chicken cross the road?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{what am i, a five year old?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why did the chicken cross the road?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i don't know, why?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{to prove he wasn't chicken.}
<A>__{meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens. her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{what the hell are they doing?}
