<A>__{mark and jennifer sit side by side on her couch. mark holds a can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his palm, staring down at it vacantly. jennifer sadly watches mark. slowly and almost absentmindedly, jennifer's hand moves over and rests gently upon mark's wrist, settling there. we hold on them for a long beat.}
