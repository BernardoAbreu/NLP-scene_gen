<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i... i need a drink of water.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{go ahead, son.}
<A>__{pete fills a glass from the pitcher. nervously, he spills a bit, and is splashes onto his coat. as some of the spectators chuckle, pete brushes the water off. he reaches into his pocket, and pulls out adele's copy of the constitution. the cover is wet. he wipes it off and sets it down on the table. he takes a sip of water. looks at the book. picks it up. pete's terrified, but in control. he speaks slowly he's making this up and thinking it out as he goes.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{mr. chairman... there's... another amendment... that i'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the fifth amendment. i wonder if you're familiar with it.}
<C>__{doyle}

<A>__{he opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{"congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."}
<A>__{pause. silence in the room.}
<B>__{adele}
<A>__{she's smiling at the tv. her eyes are filled with tears.}
<B>__{pete}
<A>__{he looks up at chairman doyle. now fully confident.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's the first amendment, mr. chairman. it's the backbone of this nation. it's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just if only we'd live up to that potential. it's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. it's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country. and even though this contract...}
<P>__{(he holds up the book)}
<D>__{... the constitution and the bill of rights even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation. not by you, mr. chairman, not by you, mr. clyde, not by any member of this committee or anyone else ever.}
<A>__{pin drop silence in the room. pete scans the faces of the panel. all betray anger.}
<B>__{on leo}
<A>__{he can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{and when you get right down to it, that's really all i have to say to this committee. good morning.}
<A>__{and with that, pete closes the book, picks up the prepared statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and walks toward the door. the cameras swing with him, and flashbulbs fire like machine guns. doyle bangs his gavel insistently.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{the witness will resume his seat! did you hear me?! you are not excused, mr. appleton!}
<A>__{and then, slowly, applause builds in the chamber, reaching a crescendo as pete reaches the door and exits.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{mr. chairman! mr. chairman...!}
