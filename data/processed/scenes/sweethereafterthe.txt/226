<D>__{daddy took a long time. i guess he wanted to have a few words with you. he must have tried to tell you that i was lying. then you would tell daddy that it didn't matter if i was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.}
<A>__{as nicole's words are heard, her point of view of sam and mitchell arguing is seen. the movement of their lips is in sync with nicole's voice over.}
<C>__{nicole }
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{everyone's lawsuit is dead. forget it. tell the others to forget it. it's over. right now, sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied. a kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, sam.}

<C>__{nicole }
<P>__{(voice over)}
