<L>__{interior norah's apartment living room night}
<A>__{a bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty styrofoam cups.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{how's the hand?}
<A>__{norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts gnawing on the side. lynn takes norah's hand and examines it.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{lynn draws norah's hand close to her lips. smiles. looks at norah. norah's a deer in headlights. lynn kisses norah's hand. everything is still and tense.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{better?}
<A>__{norah stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. she looks up to lynn. lynn kisses norah lightly on the lips. a tester kiss. then again. softly. norah doesn't move, eyes locked on lynn. all is good. norah leans in and kisses lynn's neck. lynn's eyes are closed enjoying the moment. lynn opens her eyes. the school photos of lynn sit directly across from her on the shelf. lynn stares at the pictures. waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes. norah kisses lynn's neck oblivious.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{is that?}
<A>__{lynn pulls away.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{are those...}
<A>__{lynn tries to suss it out, shakes her head, looks at norah.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{how do you have my school pictures?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i just... i found them. i was gonna tell you.}
<A>__{lynn shakes her head disbelieving.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{where would you find old pictures of me?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{at work.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{we did this job a while back. this woman...}
<A>__{lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf. her eyes focus on the photo id. her mother. her face goes completely blank. shock.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{my mom.}
<A>__{norah bites her lip and nods.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{my mom is dead.}
<A>__{a hazy mix of shame, sadness and guilt seeps into the void.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you... that first day. that's why i }
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you knew this whole time?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i think... you know, i think there's a reason that i found them. the pictures. because that lead me to you, right?}
<C>__{norah }
<D>__{and i don't know exactly what went on between you and your mom... what the situation was... but it just seems like... you know, of anybody, i would understand.}
<A>__{lynn's hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp. anger. she looks at norah with disgust.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you would understand?}
<A>__{lynn turns to leave.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{wait. please. don't...i }
<A>__{lynn opens the door. norah reaches out but lynn stops her with an icy look.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you're sick, you know that? there's something wrong with you.}
<A>__{lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap. norah sinks down onto the couch. just norah now. the emptiness crowds around her.}
