<L>__{exterior abbott home street (haley, illinois) day}
<A>__{(late spring, 1957) opening credits roll over a tent montage assorted angles of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big top" style canvas tent, including: the long steel stakes being sledge hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ending with the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. new angle tent on the front yard of the abbott mansion. the residence is on main street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. the mature, over arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade.}
<L>__{exterior abbott home street day}
<A>__{jacey holt and doug holt walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be elvis presley). jacey stops and stares with open faced misery at the tent on the abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year).}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{didn't get invited, huh?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{who cares? i'm not going and i got invited.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{who invited you?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{pam, i guess. i don't know. didn't open the envelope. i mean, come on, every time an abbott girl gets her period they have some party.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{kotex parties, kotex party hats, pin the kotex on the...}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{jacey swats doug's school books out from under his arm doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a car horn. they scurry out of the way as lloyd abbott pulls his 1957 cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. lloyd is a well dressed and fed man in his mid forties. a midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. doug is embarrassed by lloyd's passing, but jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation he gives doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.}

<L>__{interior high school corridor day (short time later)}
<A>__{eleanor abbott gathers some books from her locker. eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very popular. she is the middle of the three abbott daughters. eleanor closes her locker, turns and discovers jacey standing behind her. he follows her down the busy hall.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i tried to call you last night but the line was busy.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{no it wasn't.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{it was busy all night.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{maybe you had the wrong number?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{are you mad at me?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{no. are you mad at me?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{no. who said i was?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i just wanted to talk to you last night.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{we can talk tonight at the party.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i wasn't invited.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{yes, you were.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{no, i wasn't.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{well, now you are. but if you're mad at me you don't have to come.}
<A>__{she gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a classroom as the bell rings. the corridor is quickly vacated by all but jacey he savors the aftertaste of eleanor's smile.}
<L>__{exterior holt home evening (magic hour)}
<A>__{establishing angle of the modest two story clapboard house in a working class neighborhood. a home made ping pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950 plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway. the garage doors are open and the garage light is on. we hear (v.o.) doug singing bits and pieces of "heartbreak hotel" in his best elvis fashion.}
<L>__{interior holt home bathroom evening (magic hour)}
<A>__{doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a coat and tie) still singing "heartbreak hotel" while he carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide nib pen and a bottle of india ink. jacey's reflection appears in the mirror behind doug he's wearing a coat and tie too. jacey does a pained take on doug's handiwork:}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{oh, christ!}
<L>__{interior dining room evening (magic hourminutes later)}
<A>__{helen holt is seated at the dining table. she was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when jacey and doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand. she is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty one year old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (she teaches second grade at haley elementary school.)}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{he has to wash it off, mother. you cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it'll look worse if i wash it. it's india ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{he looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it! he doesn't get how things work in this town. i thought you weren't even going to the party?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{changed my mind.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you do understand that your sideburns don't look real?}
<A>__{doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he conceals his disappointment and nods:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(swallows, then shrugs)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she looks hard at doug for a beat, then turns to jacey.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, darling, it seems he does understand. why don't you just go on to the party and ignore doug. just have a good time and pretend you don't even...}
<A>__{jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon.}
<L>__{exterior abbott home tent street later that night}
<A>__{the curb is lined with parked cars. we hear a dance band playing "que sera" and the sounds of the party as doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his india ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette. he flicks the cigarette into the street with well rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big top" tent. doug trails his hand over lloyd abbott's cadillac, caressing it from hood to trunk as he ambles by.}
<L>__{interior abbott home tent night}
<A>__{doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering a tuxedoed ten piece band plays on the bandstand. despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls over jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother has arrived. he is dancing with eleanor. they dance past a group of young men on the sidelines (jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy, waiting like predators for their chance to dance with eleanor.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i'm going out to the lake tomorrow. sandy wants to show off her dad's new boat. why don't you come?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i have to work.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{well, i guess you'll just have to write me a letter.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{you said you wanted to talk to me in private.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i meant... just... we never get a chance to be together, alone, you know?}
<A>__{steve (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and cuts in on jacey and dances away with eleanor. jacey handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as he observes eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.}
<L>__{interior abbott home tent buffet table doug}
<A>__{ sampling the hors d'oeuvres. he places the ones he doesn't like back onto the platter. pamela abbott steps over to doug. she is his age (fifteen), the youngest of the abbott girls, and the least stuck up.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{hi. u doug hi.}
<A>__{she points at doug's chest.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{like your tie.}
<A>__{doug glances down at his tie and pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose. doug scowls and points at her bust.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{can i borrow a kleenex?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{greaser.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(mouth full of food)}
<D>__{got any smokes around here?}
<L>__{interior abbott home back yard night}
<A>__{doug and pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard. the tent can be seen in the b.g. the band is playing "mona lisa."}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so, is this peter guy alice is gonna marry rich?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{of course. he's one of the atlas steel vanlaninghams. pittsburgh. he's a bully.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so how come alice's marrying him?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{because my parents want her to and alice is afraid of my parents. it's practically an arranged marriage. they think alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that peter was the one to do it with.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{look, alice is the good daughter, eleanor is the bad one, and i'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. that's just the way it works. which one are you?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you mean, which kind of brother am i? you got me? the little brother, i guess.}
<L>__{interior abbott home tent night (short time later)}
<A>__{the band improvises a fanfare as lloyd abbott and his wife, joan abbott, step up onto the bandstand. joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). she has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen i'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight the engagement of our daughter, alice, to mister peter vanlaningham.}
<A>__{he gestures to alice abbott and her fiance peter vanlaningham. alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. peter is the scion of a wealthy pittsburgh family. he and his bride to be smile and acknowledge the applause and ad libbed toasts. the band strikes up "i got the world on a string" and joan whispers something to alice alice goes over to lloyd and (despite his mock protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. the guests applaud their uninspired box step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters.}
<L>__{exterior abbott home driveway & tent night}
<A>__{the party is going full swing as doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway. he's had enough of high society for tonight.}
<L>__{exterior sidewalk (haley) night}
<A>__{doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing "you ain't nothin' but a hound dog." he pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. as he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance.}
<L>__{exterior abbott home back yard night}
<A>__{eleanor necks with steve (jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. the sounds of the party can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing "in old monterey"). jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.}
<L>__{exterior street (haley) night (short time later)}
<A>__{jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.}
<L>__{exterior holt home sidewalk & garage night}
<A>__{(minutes later) as jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. the garage doors are open, doug sits on the edge of the ping pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{three out of five?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{two out of three. you serve.}
<A>__{jacey and doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping pong. they are expert players and fierce competitors.}
<L>__{exterior texaco gas station (downtown haley) next day}
<A>__{lloyd abbott pulls his (1957) cadillac up to the pumps. the ding ding of the bell hose summons jacey. he wears a texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{'morning.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{fill 'er up. hi test.}
<A>__{jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the windshield. lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash, climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the trash can.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{that was a nice party last night.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you were there?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{yes, sir. eleanor invited me.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{did she? didn't see you.}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{you going to be an engineer like your dad was?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i want to be an architect.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{hmmm... i guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{i care about making money.}
<A>__{lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that enables it to slide in and out of the dash.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production, did you know that? we'll ship thirty maybe forty thousand of those file cabinets this year. hell, that drawer put midwest steel desk on the map.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{yes, sir. i know.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{an architect, huh?}
<A>__{the gas nozzle clicks off, jacey hangs up the nozzle, and replaces the gas cap. lloyd pulls out his wallet.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you want some free advice?}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{don't waste your life making other people rich. keep the change.}
<A>__{he hands jacey a five spot and gets into his car. lloyd drives away in his cadillac. jacey crumbles the five dollar bill into a ball. as he returns to the office he catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette machine. he frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.}
<L>__{interior boathouse (lake) later that day}
<A>__{the abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. doug strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over, holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. the amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed. victor, doug's partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (victor is fifteen, too.)}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{jeez louise! how'd you do that?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{intestinal gas produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon. a mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. that's the secret ingredient.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what's so secret about it?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{not everyone can produce methane. it's genetic, that means it's inherited. there's a lot of methane in my family.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you're full of shit.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{look it up, it's all in the encyclopedia.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{they don't got farts in the encyclopedia.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, they got 'vagina' in the dictionary, they got farts in the encyclopedia.}
<A>__{the roar of a passing speedboat attracts doug's interest.}

<L>__{exterior boathouse dock (lake) continuous action day}
<A>__{doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a male water skier. (another young man is driving the boat with two young women in bathing suits as passengers.) victor comes out as the speedboat's wake rocks the old dock.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{assholes!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it's jacey that's him skiing. he must've skipped out on work.}
<L>__{exterior lake angle on speedboat}
<A>__{ with jacey skiing behind it. steve is at the helm. eleanor and sandy lounge in their bathing suits. as they pass a ski ramp steve points to it. jacey gives him a thumb's up gesture and steve circles the boat around for the approach.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{no way! he's never done the ramp.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he wants to do it.}
<A>__{steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open. jacey swings out on the end of the tow rope and pops over the wake. eleanor leans over to steve.}

<D>__{you know you're going too fast?}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<A>__{the boat zips by the ramp and jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. he takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.}
