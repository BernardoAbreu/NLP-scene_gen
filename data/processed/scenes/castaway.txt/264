<L>__{exterior hawaii beach restaurant}
<A>__{a terrace by the ocean. tables filled with diners. food being delivered by waiters. so simple, eating. so taken for granted. at one table sits chuck, dressed in a hawaiian shirt and shorts, with a half dozen plates in front of him. he gestures to the waiter. bring me more. it all tastes so damned good. behind him is the ocean. chuck doesn't glance at it.}
