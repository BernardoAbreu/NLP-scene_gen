<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{jack is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as possible to the world outside. he downs a grappa: then gets up to pay for it. his movements are slow and leisurely. the barman hands him his change. and a small white envelope. jack is not expecting this.}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{someone left this for "l'americano". this afternoon.}
<A>__{jack looks at the envelope.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{grazie.}
<A>__{he turns casually away from the barman's prying eyes and opens the envelope with extreme caution. inside is a folded cutting. it's from the swedish daily newspaper ostersunds posten. jack unfolds the cutting. we catch a glimpse of: ingrid's dacha. a police line. three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl. heart racing, jack slips the cutting in his pocket. grabs three sugar cubes from a silver bowl on the bar. and leaves.}
