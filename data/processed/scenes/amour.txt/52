<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{he tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping cup. she won't loosen her lips.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{... please, open your mouth... go on... open it... anne! please!... come on... stop that!...}
<A>__{he sits upright.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{if you don't drink, you'll die.}
<A>__{indecipherable sound from anne.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{is that what you want?}
<A>__{pause. she looks at him. he bends over her again, presents the cup in front of her sealed lips.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{come on, anne, please.}
<A>__{she doesn't react. he opens her lips with his fingers and tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth. pours a little tea in. the liquid runs out of her mouth.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{goddammit!}
<A>__{he puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid, some of which has run down onto the pillow. he tries to mop it up. she watches him the whole time. finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her. tries not to show his helplessness and his anger.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne! ... you can't force me to let you die of thirst. if you persist, i will call bertier and he'll put you in hospital. they can force feed you there. is that what you want?}
<B>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i promised to spare you that. but you must help me. i'm out of my depth.}
<A>__{he takes the cup again and puts it against her lips.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{please, anne!}
<A>__{her lips remain sealed. he presses the cup hard against them.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{drink that, now!}
<A>__{it hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little liquid.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{she closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{then she spits it all out like a fountain. after a moment of bewilderment, he slaps her. silence. he's frightened by his own gesture. then he puts down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. they don't look at each other.}
<B>__{long pause.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{help... help...}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{please, forgive me.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{anne}
