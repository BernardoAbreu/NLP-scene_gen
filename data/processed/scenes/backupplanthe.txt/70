<L>__{interior stan's bathroom moments later}
<A>__{zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth. stan enters.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{zoe?}
<A>__{he looks at her. sees the tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{why are you crying? everything's perfect.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's not.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{sure it is.}
<A>__{zoe takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{uh, i'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast.}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i just found out.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{pregnant? as in you're going to have a baby?}
<A>__{zoe nods.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know. it's hard to explain.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, who's it?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't know who the father is. i kind of know him. i just don't know his name exactly. it was sort of anonymous.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{anonymous?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he's a donor. from a sperm bank.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? sperm bank? what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know, this is so fucked up.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{when did all of this happen?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{the day we met. that same day. and i didn't tell you because i didn't think there was any way i could be pregnant.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{but...why?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{no, why would you do this?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because i wanted a baby. and i'm almost forty, and i never met the right guy. i was afraid if i waited any longer it would all pass me by, and i'd miss my chance.}
<A>__{stan just looks at her. speechless.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{i didn't know you. i would have never done it if }
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i just told you i loved you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well....do you not now?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're pregnant.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{don't say it like that.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're pregnant.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yes. i'm pregnant. i'm pregnant!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i tell you i'm in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some stranger's child?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{don't say it like that. you make it sound dirty.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i...i'm stunned. i don't know what to say. what the fuck am i supposed to say?! this is great fucking news? congratulations?! why did you wait so long to tell me?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because i'm freaking out, okay! i didn't know what to do. i made this big decision to do this and then i met you }
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, what am i supposed to do now? this isn't how it was supposed to be. this isn't what }
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry, okay? life isn't perfect. it's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band. it's messy. it's fucked up. this is real life, okay? i'm sorry to break it to you.}
<A>__{they both stand there. after the raised voices, the silence feels more pronounced.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{sorry? what's sorry going to do?}
<A>__{stan walks out. zoe stands there. and stands there. and then she starts to cry.}
