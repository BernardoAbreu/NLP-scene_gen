<L>__{interior palace}
<A>__{indiana is led into the ruler's chamber. indy sees scraggy, tied to a leash. an angry, vengeful look covers indy's face. he turns to gutterbuhg. the nazi, still stuffing his face with food, pulls tightly on scraggy's leash.}
<C>__{gutterbuhg}
<D>__{your friend makes a wonderful interpreter.}
<A>__{indy's eyes burn. gutterbuhg gulps down a glass of wine. liquid spittles from the sides of his mouth. he looks at indy.}
<C>__{gutterbuhg}
<D>__{"the nazi party will exist for one thousand years...and i wish to be alive for every year!"}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that is a favorite philosophy of our feuher.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{your feuher's philosphies belong on a bathroom wall.}
<C>__{gutterbuhg}
<P>__{(angry, slapping indy across the face)}
<D>__{this is a very serious matter, doctor jones. it could save your life.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i understand that somewhere in this city...there is a garden of... immortal peaches?...}
<P>__{(indy doesn't respond, gutterbuhg continues)}
<D>__{i want information about this garden... and i would greatly appreciate it, if you would share everything you know, with me.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i don't share anything with nazis.}
<A>__{gutterbuhg nods. he takes another bite of food, shooting a glowering look to indiana.}
<C>__{gutterbuhg}
<D>__{very well. my friends will be here soon. they will rest...enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom...}
<P>__{(kisses a woman, and pushes her away)}
<D>__{then we shall exterminate these worthless people! destroy their city! and we will carry away all of its riches...in pieces.}
<A>__{gutterbuhg goes back to his food. scraggy exchanges a worried glance with indiana.}
