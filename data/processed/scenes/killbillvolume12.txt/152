<L>__{interior institution}
<A>__{the institution is not spanish in style, but on the contrary it's a clinical new age box like structure made up of clear glass doors and walls and the color beige. bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone asian female receptionist, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. in japanese he explains to her his reason for being there. ex cu the bride's eye ...watching...we now leave any shot of bill not from the bride's perspective. the suspense theme is stretched tighter and tighter as we look through the bride's pov and listen to her vo;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{the attentive audience members among you will have probably noticed, that all my kills have been straight up fights.}
<A>__{the bride's pov: the glass enclosed institution, and bill standing by himself in the empty lobby.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{y'all figured i'd face him with my hanzo sword, aye? well, i figured bill figured the same thing. i am the product of three godfathers. bill, pai mei, and hattori hanzo. different teachers teach you different things. but one thing i learned from all three, was "in combat, the opponent that does the unexpected, can usually expect to be the victor." bill would never see this coming. not from me. and least any of you judge me a bushwhacker, remember...it was bill who taught me how to shoot.}
<A>__{as the bride has said these things, we've seen inserts of her putting together her high powered scope rifle. snapping on the scope sight. setting the focus through the crosshairs. loading the heavy duty ammo. curling her long white finger around the rifle's trigger. scope sight pov: bill's head in between the crosshairs. suspense theme is stretched tighter still...it will soon break.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{looking through the institution's glass wall. the elevator in the lobby opens...and a little girl steps out, and runs into bill's arms. a little girl about five years old. a five year old little girl with blonde hair. bill picks up the little girl and lifts her head into the crosshairs of the scope}
<B>__{sight.}
<A>__{suspense theme snaps into an operatic wail... ex cu: the bride's finger, pops off the trigger. ex cu: the bride's eye, a huge tear falls out...we move out of the eyeball, into a medium cu of the bride, tears falling down her face...she can't believe what she's looking at...that's her daughter...she's alive... her remembering theme plays...}
<B>__{flash on}
<A>__{the bride remembering, while she was in her wide eyed coma state, lying on an operating table, as doctors and nurses performed a cesarean childbirth on her. the newborn infant is passed to other hands above her wide eyed unblinking expressionless face. cu of the bride in one moment, bill has managed to suddenly change the game.}
