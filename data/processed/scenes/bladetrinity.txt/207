<L>__{exterior seaside cliff day}
<A>__{a bright summer day. blade stands at the edge of a cliff, looking out over a sun struck ocean. for the first time since we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or handguns or rifles. and were it not for the sword he holds, we might even mistake him for an ordinary man.}
<C>__{abigail }
<D>__{and so blade took it.}
<A>__{blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below.}
<C>__{abigail }
<D>__{we never saw him again.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{we see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight from above as it twirls end over end.}
<B>__{back to blade}
<A>__{at peace with himself at last. after a moment's reflection, he turns and walks away.}
<C>__{abigail }
<D>__{he disappeared completely.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but that's what heroes do. they simply fade out. and in this way }
<B>__{a series of dissolves}
<A>__{as blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling into the horizon until he disappears entirely.}
<C>__{abigail }
<D>__{ they become legends.}
