<L>__{exterior barton cottage front door day}
<A>__{the dashwoods cluster round the door.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{willoughby, come back!}
<A>__{she is silenced by elinor as willoughby seizes bedivere's reins from thomas, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.}
<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour day}
<A>__{they all rush back into the parlour.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{meg, dearest, please ask betsy to make a cup of hot tea for marianne.}
<A>__{margaret nods dumbly and goes. mrs dashwood has her arms around marianne.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{what is wrong, my love?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{nothing! please do not ask me questions!}
<A>__{marianne struggles free.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{please let me be!}
<A>__{she runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. there is a moment of stunned silence.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{they must have quarreled.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{that is unlikely. perhaps this lady allen disapproves of his regard for marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{then why did he not say as much? it is not like willoughby to be secretive. did he think marianne was richer than she is?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{how could he?}
<A>__{she gestures to the room and then looks at elinor with a frown.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{what is it you suspect him of?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i can hardly tell you. but why was his manner so guilty?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{what are you saying, elinor? that he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time?}
<A>__{mrs dashwood is getting defensive. elinor pauses to think.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no, he loves her, i am sure.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{of course he loves her!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but has he left her with any assurance of his return? cannot you ask her if he has proposed?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{certainly not. i cannot force a confidence from marianne and nor must you. we must trust her to confide in us in her own time.}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{there was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{you are resolved, then, to think the worst of him.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{not resolved }
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{i prefer to give him the benefit of my good opinion. he deserves no less. from all of us.}
<A>__{she stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. elinor follows her.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mamma, i am very fond of willoughby }
<A>__{mrs dashwood goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. elinor is halfway up the stairs. she meets a wet eyed margaret coming down with a cup of tea.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{she would not let me in.}
<A>__{elinor takes the cup and margaret runs out into the garden in tears. the sound of sobbing also comes from marianne's room, and now from mrs dashwood's as well. elinor sits down helplessly on the stairs and drinks the tea.}
