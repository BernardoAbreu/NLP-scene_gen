<L>__{interior courtroom continuous}
<A>__{dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room. as she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some weeping softly. some of them notice christine's entrance and nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common bond...they are all carrying the same grief. one of the couples, mr. and mrs. clay, see christine and go to her, speaking softly. they should be distinct enough in appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see them again later.}
<C>__{mrs. clay}
<D>__{mrs. collins? i'm leanne clay, this is my husband, john...i just wanted to pass on my sympathies. what we went through, waiting to hear anything about our son david, was bad enough, and now this....}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but there was no call for what the police did to you...no call at all.}
<A>__{she nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom opens. they take their seats as a judge and two attorneys take their places, preceded by a bailiff.}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{all rise.}
<A>__{they do. the judge takes his seat. the rest of the room also sits. he nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another door, leading to the holding area. as christine looks on, gordon stewart northcott is ushered into the courtroom for his initial plea. some women break into tears at the sight of him. he first seems startled by the presence of so many, then he smiles. an audience. as he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the room and meets the gaze of christine collins. her face pales, as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{hey...i saw you in the papers. you got a lot of moxie, standing up to the police like that.}
<A>__{the bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge. christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of seeing her react to his comments. the judge looks up. changeling a true story}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{gordon stewart northcott, you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney's office. how do you plea?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{not guilty, your honor.}
<A>__{he glances back at his audience. the bailiff rights him again.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{in light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set. this court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court's calendar.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the defendant is remanded into custody. bailiff....}
<A>__{the bailiff removes gordon, who shares one last look with his audience, and christine in particular. he winks at her. she doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction. but once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes, fighting tears. hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says nothing. there's nothing to say.}
<C>__{jones }
<D>__{the boy, walter collins, was reported as missing on march 10, 1928.}
