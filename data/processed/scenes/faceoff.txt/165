<L>__{interior archer's house day}
<A>__{maybe days, maybe weeks later no way to tell. eve is at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports. sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at the front screen door a man's silhouette.}
<C>__{archer }
<D>__{hello, eve.}
<A>__{pulse pounding, eve frantically pushes open the door to glimpse the face of the man with archer's voice. it's jon archer. eve stares then touches his face carefully, tenderly around the tiny residual scar. then, she pulls him tight holding on for dear life.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{jamie is there. archer smiles gently, almost sadly with a softness and genuineness that castor troy could never feel, could never fake. she rushes to him. the whole family hangs on, hugging and kissing for the first time ever, really together.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i'm sorry i shot you, dad. am i grounded?}
<A>__{archer smiles and holds her tighter. but as they draw archer inside, he hesitates.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i have something to ask you to ask both of you...}
<A>__{he steps aside revealing castor's son.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{this is adam. he needs a place to live... just for a little while.}
<A>__{eve looks at archer she sees what this means to him and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.}
