<A>__{close on: a cassette player. we see the familiar handwritten label: "miles davis." "kind of blue" plays as maggie listens in a chair, looking shell shocked, surrounded by the post its she stole from ike's room. we see as she reads them: "father, two fisted drinker," "peggy, best friend, but peggy doesn't totally trust maggie," "bob" doesn't love him. overwhelmed, she finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music. the camera moves on the last note on the floor next to her chair. it reads: "shows no remorse".}
