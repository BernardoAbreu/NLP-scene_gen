<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom, chet's apartment day}
<A>__{the door is shut. will sits on the toilet lid. he has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest. the actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. the wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it. will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off...no luck.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's too tight!}
<A>__{he is calling off toward the}
<C>__{kitchen}
<A>__{where chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom. he uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what if we try to separate your shoulder?}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{well, all these sites say different shit. there's not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community.}
<A>__{will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is pointless.}
<A>__{chet shuts his laptop.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i agree. we gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we can't. these guys said they'd be following me. and i don't have a clue what they look like. for all i know, they're outside right now. they see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses.}
<A>__{will stares at chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what do i do, man? what do i do now?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i don't know, will...i guess you gotta rob the bank.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i haven't been inside a bank in three years! how the fuck am i supposed to rob one!? they wouldn't even give me a savings account!}
<A>__{will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands, fighting hysterics. chet offers a stock reassurance }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, it's not! i'm gonna blow up! that's way worse than getting stabbed or shot. at least some people survive that. no one survives being blown up.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{no one is ever like, "yeah, i heard steve got blown up, tough break, but how's he doing now? is he still in the rec basketball league?" no of course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing left of steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops!}
<A>__{chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. it's a crushing sight. chet strides across the apartment }
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{pull yourself together!}
<A>__{ and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps. but will flinches and chet slaps him right on the ear.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ow! fuck! i think you popped my eardrum.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{sorry. shit. i didn't mean to do that. but just listen to me now. you're not gonna die. you wanna know why? because you know exactly how to rob a bank.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{point break.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the movie?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yes. that movie is like a how to guide for bank robberies. you just bust in. masks. guns. move fast. stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah...i guess it's pretty simple, right? and it's just a local bank. the donner wells on charles road.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{really? i applied for a job there like a year ago.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you wanted to be a teller?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yeah, so what? it's a good job. you get benefits.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{like what, a name tag?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what kind of benefits do you get? free toppings?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's really clever. no one ever said that shit to me before. anyway, this is perfect. you know the whole layout of the bank.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{not exactly. they didn't hand me the security schematics with the application. but i sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. i know what the place looks like.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how many guards?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{one. i think.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's a start.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{it's a great start. you can do it.}
<A>__{will pauses.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're gonna do it with me, right?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i was actually gonna stick to giving tips, ideas...motivational speeches. more of a consultant or advisory role.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{jesus christ, chet. please. i'm begging you here. i need you on this. if i do it alone, i'm dead.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{are you gonna cry again?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that was a moment of weakness.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes. i will fucking cry again if that's what it takes.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i should make you blow me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sure. whip that shit out. i'm actually kinda curious. i wanna see if jenny rifkin lied to you. she obviously lied to me.}
<A>__{chet cracks a smile.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{all these guys want is 100 grand. we can do this.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{we're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand? just leave the rest of the money sitting there? why?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess they're very modest criminals. who the fuck cares? wait...you said "we" right?}
<A>__{chet heaves a sigh.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i'm putting my life on the line for 100 grand...what does 100 grand even buy these days?}
