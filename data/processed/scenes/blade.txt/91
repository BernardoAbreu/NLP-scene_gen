<L>__{interior whistler's workshop night}
<A>__{whistler and karen sit at a work table. karen is looking at a blood smear slide through a microscope.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{all right, let's start with the basics why do vampires need to drink blood?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like hemolytic anemia?}
<A>__{whistler nods.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so what about gene therapy?}
<A>__{whistler looks intrigued. karen continues.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{basically you'd have to re write the victim's dna, alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{with a retrovirus. it's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's dna to mutate. they've been using them to treat sickle cell anemia.}
<A>__{whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you're serious? you actually think this could work?}
<A>__{karen pauses we can see in her expression that there's something she's been holding back.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{on me, yes. on blade, i'm not so sure }
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{the problem is, blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did. he was born with it. the irony is, i could probably cure every vampire but him.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{then we're back to square one, aren't we? sooner or later, the thirst always wins.}
<A>__{at that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out. karen looks around the room, alarmed.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what happened to the power?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{i don't know, but the back up generator should've kicked in.}
<A>__{a few seconds pass. the back up generator still hasn't activated. whistler moves to the window }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{uv floodlights are down too.}
<A>__{as whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of glass shattering coming from the other end of the workshop. whistler shines the flashlight in that direction. we hear more sounds now water draining, glass tinkling. whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. he edges towards the black out curtains, karen falling in behind him.}
