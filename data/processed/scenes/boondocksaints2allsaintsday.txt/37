<L>__{interior berth later}
<A>__{murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. with the rigged pen, he tattoos his brother's back. connor cooks something, in a pot, on the hot plate. the resin of anger is evident. tattoos: murphy's back has the crucified feet of christ and connor's shows christ's downcast head on the cross.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{the prodigal son, huh? he wants us, he's fuckin' got us.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{but why would he do something so public?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{think about it. people figure we did it. makes it more likely someone will drop a dime. way easier to get to us in prison, isn't it, now.}
<A>__{the berth door is slightly ajar. in pops a bottle of whiskey, then romeo's head. he's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their backs to him. he's instantly taken by their ink.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{but how would anyone recognize us?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{you don't remember those sketches on the news channel?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{shit. that's right. y'know, every time they show those composites on tv and then they catch the guy, it looks nothin' like him. but ours?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{just our luck. we get leonardo fuckin' divinci as a sketch artist.}
<A>__{romeo listens with suspicion.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{maybe we should dye our hair.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yeah. these guys are always dyin' their hair. you know, like in "the fugitive." it's covert and shit.}
<A>__{connor smirks privately.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{what color would you dye it?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i don't know...lighter, i guess.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{y'mean...blonde?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i didn't say that!}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{california, surfer boy, gay, gay blonde?!}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i'm warnin' ya!}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{just keep your hands off my ass back there and, "stay gold, pony boy."}
<A>__{connor laughs heartily.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{murphy stabs the ink pen into his brother's shoulder.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{aaaaah!}
<A>__{connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. hot water and pennies spread across the floor. connor pulls the pen out.}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{you motherfucker!}
<A>__{romeo steps inside and sees the pennies.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{serves ya right!}
<A>__{the boys are just about to fight when...}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{the brothers snap their heads toward. a stunned romeo points to them, then the pennies.}
<C>__{romeo }
<D>__{i know who you are. you guys are the fuckin'....}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{shut it!}
<A>__{murphy moves behind romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{oh, this is so fucking cool, man. i'm from boston. i love you guys. shit, everybody does! i mean, holy fucking shit! maybe i could get in on this, you know? bring some la raza ta this thing. spice it up a little. hey, is it true you guys say a prayer before you grease somebody?}
<A>__{connor pulls a gun. the boys jump on romeo and pin him to the floor. murphy clasps a hand over romeo's mouth. connor puts the gun to romeo's head. their faces glaze over, religious ecstasy...}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{and an awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven...}
<A>__{romeo's eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{...as the terrible hand of the lord struck upon the earth.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{and as almighty god created you...he now calleth you home.}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger "click."}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{ooops. busy signal. we'll hafta calleth back.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{let's have a shot while we're waitin'.}
<A>__{the boys laugh, snatch the bottle. romeo is in shock.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{that shit was not funny, man!}
<A>__{the brothers laugh harder. romeo rolls on his side and slides a hand down the back of his pants. he seems relieved.}
<C>__{romeo }
<D>__{oh, thank you, jesus. thought i greased my drawers.}
