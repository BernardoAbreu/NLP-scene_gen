<L>__{exterior echo park (downtown l.a.) day}
<A>__{john sits at a park bench. motionless. taking in the world. clouds passing the sun. shadows drifting across the city. leaves swirling after passing cars. john just sits there, hearing every breath he takes, wondering which one will be his last.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{lung cancer? lung cancer?!}
<A>__{john turns to see ellie (23) strutting up the sidewalk. uninhibited. oozing sex appeal. but dangerous. in more ways than you think.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{that's funny as shit, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{as if you guys didn't have something to do with it...}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{hey, i think you brought this one on yourself.}
<A>__{john stares at her, tries to get a read.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{now why wouldn't you trust me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know, something in the air }
<A>__{she sits right on his lap, playfully.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{don't worry, john, you'll beat this. you beat everything.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not this time, ellie.}
<A>__{john lifts her off of him, sets her aside.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh wow, you're serious... no wonder the boss is in such a good mood.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, i thought maybe you could talk to him for me. you know...?}
<A>__{ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd sound as she does.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what?! dammit, john, i know i owe you but to even ask that? all those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks. he's going to take all that out on you, john, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so i take that as a 'no?'}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you're the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect. and you know how much he despises this place.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm starting to see his pointerior}
<A>__{ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{have you gone to see the snob?}
<A>__{like scratching fingers across a blackboard. no way.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{look, don't let your ego get in the way on this. i'd miss having someone up here i can... relate to.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss. and for a second john's leg is brushed by a tail. john doesn't react. just turns and walks away.}
