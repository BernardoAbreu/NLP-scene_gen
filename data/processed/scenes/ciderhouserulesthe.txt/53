<A>__{homer storms down the hall, then stops, pulling off his white coat. angry, pacing, he kicks at nothing.}
<L>__{exterior st. cloud's graveyard early morning}
<A>__{buster and homer are digging the pit. larch paces by the coffin of the 12 year old girl.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{what'd she die of?}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(inhales deeply)}
<D>__{she died of secrecy, she died of ignorance...}
<A>__{buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{if you expect people to be responsible for their children, you have to give them the right to decide whether or not to have children. wouldn't you agree?}
<A>__{buster doesn't get it. homer has heard this too many times; he rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{how about this child? you expect her to be responsible?}
<A>__{homer looks away.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i didn't mean her. i'm talking about... adults.}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you know who i mean!}
<A>__{larch studies him.}
