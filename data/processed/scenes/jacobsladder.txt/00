<L>__{exterior vietnam dusk}
<A>__{a swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army of men over a vietnamese hillside. the soldiers scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection of the jungle. falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants, seventy five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness. it is dusk. the mood is lazy, soporific. members of one platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a jointerior}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{my head.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's nerves. take another toke.}
<A>__{george reaches out, extending a jointerior suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. the others stand back, startled. jacob grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{before anyone can answer jerry grabs his head, screaming. he turns frantically in all directions.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{help me! help me!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what the hell ... ?}
<A>__{in seconds jerry is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking into a terrific blur. he crashes into frank with the force of a truck. frank slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. he begins gasping and hyperventilating. his eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air. fear and confusion sweep across his face. the men watch, horrified, as frank's terror escalates beyond reason into all out panic. suddenly frank begins howling. he lunges for his bayonet and, without warning, attacks the men around him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{god almighty!}
<A>__{paul spins out of the way as frank's bayonet impales the ground. jacob jumps on top of frank and wrestles him into the tall grass. paul rushes to his assistance. jacob stares at frank's face as frank struggles beneath him. it is the face of a madman.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good god! what's happening?}
<A>__{the sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them. guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{behind you! look out! this is it!}
<A>__{the men spin around. paul panics and jumps to his feet, leaving jacob alone with frank. frank's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers his strength.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<A>__{dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. soldiers squint to see. it is a horrifying vision.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they're coming!}
<A>__{gunfire explodes on all sides. suddenly paul flips out. he begins screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. frank is struggling like four men and jacob is weakening in his effort to restrain him. bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. bodies fall. more bodies keep coming. the first wave is upon them. rod shoots into the air. shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like banshees. rod, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of his attacker. agonizing cries accompany his fall. rod yanks the bayonet out and stabs again. in the midst of this madness frank shoots to his feet and slams the butt of his rifle into jacob's back. there is a cracking sound. jacob's eyes freeze with pain. his hands rush for his spine. as he spins around one of the attackers jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into jacob's stomach. jacob screams. it is a loud and piercing wail.}
