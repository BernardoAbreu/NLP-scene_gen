<A>__{totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo tion. camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs away from the scene. ushers and uniformed security men rush past him towards the stage. people leap from their seats. a woman screams piercingly behind him. portman doesn't blink.}
<L>__{interior stage night}
<A>__{dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around frank and rachel. rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as hands reach out to help her, the blood on frank's shirt. he has taken the hits for her. but he's still on the job, gaze alert. without taking his eyes from the audi torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to push rachel back down. the right arm, gun in hand, sweeps the auditorium. where is portman? frank can't see past the mob. ushers fall on frank in a heap, trying to disarm him. security men try to pull them off. rachel shouts, trying to make herself heard above the noise.}

<A>__{frank's pov series of shots a series of swift low angle shots through legs and faces. one brief glimpse that could be portman. a cameraman turns. it's not. frank is desperate, pushing away a helping arm. the chaos mounts. sirens wail outside.}
