<L>__{interior subway platform sector four day}
<A>__{not so crowded at this hour. halfway down the platform we see a vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. a mouse ish resident collects a bar from the trough. his name is kleinwort nine alpha. seeing lincoln approach, he preempts }
<C>__{kleinwort}
<D>__{no, no, no. use your own sugar quota.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{c'mon, kleinwort...}
<A>__{he says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence on the smaller man. kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{so what's up with the censors, huh?}
<C>__{kleinwort}
<D>__{they're conducting a census check. or don't you watch the bulletins?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i know what it is. i've just never seen them out in this sector before.}
<C>__{kleinwort}
<D>__{probably just tracking a glitch. a bad scanner or maybe an userware defect.}
<P>__{(off lincoln's puzzled look)}
<D>__{ethercuffs. they get damaged, you get a false read. sometimes even a dropout.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what are you saying? they lost someone?}
<C>__{kleinwort}
<D>__{someone just isn't showing up where they should be. what do you care?}
<A>__{a rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation. beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on lincoln's brow.}
