<L>__{exterior city hall morning}
<A>__{already shimmering with heat. a drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at the foot of the steps. gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior council chambers}
<A>__{former mayor sam bagby is speaking. behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering:}
<D>__{"proposed alto vallejo dam and reservoir"}
<A>__{some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while bagby is speaking.}
<C>__{bagby}
<D>__{gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty five minutes end up smack in the pacific ocean. now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it. remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. los angeles is a desert community. beneath this building, beneath every street there's a desert. without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we'd never existed!}
<P>__{(pausing, letting the implication sink in)}
<B>__{close gittes}
<A>__{sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. he yawns, edges away from one of the dirtier farmers.}
<C>__{bagby }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the alto vallejo can save us from that, and i respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them.}
<B>__{audience council chambers}
<A>__{an amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest. a couple of the farmers applaud. somebody shooshes them.}
<B>__{council committee}
<A>__{in a whispered conference.}
<C>__{councilman}
<P>__{(acknowledging bagby)}
<D>__{mayor bagby... let's hear from the departments again. i suppose we better take water and power first. mr. mulwray.}
<B>__{reaction gittes}
<A>__{looking up with interest from his racing form.}
<B>__{mulwray}
<A>__{walks to the huge map with overleafs. he is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. he turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. the man turns the overleaf on the map.}
<C>__{mulwray}
<D>__{in case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the van der lip dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the van der lip disaster. it couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there.}
<P>__{(referring to a new overleaf)}
<D>__{now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. well, it won't hold. i won't build it. it's that simple. i am not making that kind of mistake twice. thank you, gentlemen.}
<A>__{mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced farmer drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. naturally, they cause a commotion.}
<C>__{council president}
<P>__{(shouting to farmer)}
<D>__{what in the hell do you think you're doing?}
<P>__{(as the sheep bleat}
<D>__{down the aisles toward}
<P>__{the council)}
<D>__{get those goddam things out of here!}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(right back)}
<D>__{tell me where to take them! you don't have an answer for that so quick, do you?}
<A>__{bailiffs and sergeants at arms respond to the imprecations of the council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack mulwray.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(through above, to mulwray)}
<D>__{you steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, mr. mulwray, that's what i want to know!}
<B>__{l.a. riverbed long shot}
<A>__{it's virtually empty. sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds. after a moment, mulwray's car pulls into view on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. mulwray gets out of the car. me looks around.}
<B>__{with gittes}
<A>__{holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. he watches while mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed. there mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{trains the binoculars on him. sun glints off mulwray's glasses.}
<B>__{below gittes}
<A>__{there's the sound of something like champagne corks popping. then a small mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed, and into gitte's view.}
<B>__{mulwray}
<A>__{himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water at his feet. he moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, toward gittes.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{moves a little further back as mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the mexican boy on the muddy banks. mulwray says something to the boy. the boy doesn't answer at first. mulwray points to the ground. the boy gestures. mulwray frowns. he kneels down in the mud and stares at it. he seems to be concentrating on it. after a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream scrambling up the bank to his car. there he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them. he spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time. the power lines overhead hum. he stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car. he drives off.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{hurries to get back to his car. he gets in and gets right back out. the steamy leather burns him. he takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one. he gets in and takes off.}
<B>__{point fermin park dusk}
<A>__{street lights go on.}
<B>__{mulwray}
<A>__{pulls up, parks. hurries out of the car, across the park lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in the direction mulwray had gone. he makes it through the trees in time to see mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of the cliff to the beach below. be seems in a hurry. gittes moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating the climb than mulwray did.}
<B>__{down on the beach}
<A>__{gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent. he looks to his left. there's a promontory of sorts. it's apparent mulwray has gone that way. gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above mulwray.}
<B>__{at the outfall}
<A>__{gittes spots mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand. mulwray picks up a starfish. brushes the sand off it. looks absently up toward gittes.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.}
<B>__{beacon light at point fermin}
<A>__{flashing in the dust.}
<B>__{close gittes}
<A>__{sitting, suddenly starts. he swears softly. he's in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.}
<B>__{mulwray}
<A>__{below him in watching the water trickling down from the outfall near gittes. mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. even as gittes watches mulwray watching, the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam. at the street gittes' car there's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash light. it says: "save our city! los angeles is dying of thirst! protect your property! los angeles is your investment in the future!!! vote yes november 6... citizens committee to save our city, hon. sam bagby, former mayor chairman." gittes grumbles, crumples it up and tosses it out the window. he notices other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street. gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.}
