<L>__{exterior second story window night}
<A>__{angle tree steve tears at the branches, trying to free robbie. a crimson fluid pumps thick from the branches that steve destroys. as suddenly as it began, the final burst of wind passes the tree like the caboose at the end of a runaway train. he frees his son and they topple out of the tree. robbie throws his arms around his dad and the two hold on for their lives, gasping, hugging, choking on the rain and sap. the tree is uprooted before them and disappears into the storm.}
