<A>__{a city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. a man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road. cole, with debbie in tow, grabs the truck's driver and hauls him out of his seat. he then places debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. he peels out. our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. he keeps placing the cones on the street. however, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. the man's leisure pace speeds up. he rapidly places cones on the road at break neck speed.}
