<L>__{interior fambrough's office day}
<A>__{sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is major}
<B>__{fambrough.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{lt. john j. dunbar.}
<A>__{lt. dunbar is standing in front of the desk.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{indian fighter, huh?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<P>__{(indicating paper)}
<D>__{your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier. the frontier is indian country. i quickly deduced that you are an indian fighter.}
<A>__{he arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. he has sad swollen eyes. he is an army lifer passed over too many times for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i did not ascend to this position by being stupid.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no sir.}
<A>__{fambrough returns to the order. dunbar watches him in silence. the major's tunic is covered with food stains. sweat has broken out all over his head. his grooming is awful. his hands are trembling slightly. something is very wrong with him. now the major sees something on the official paper. he looks quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving his lips but making no sound.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{it says here you've been decorated.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{and they sent you out here to be posted?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{actually sir, i'm here at my own request... i want to see the frontier.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{you want to see the frontier?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir... before it's gone.}
<A>__{the major fixes dunbar with a sly look.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{such a smart lad coming straight to me.}
<A>__{still sly, fambrough digs into a side drawer. there is the distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. now fambrough has what he wants, a blank official form. he begins to fill it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{sir knight, i am sending you on a knight's errand. you will report to captain cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm... fort sedgewick.}
<A>__{he looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and affixes his signature with a wild flourish.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{my personal seal will assure you safe passage through many miles of wild hostile country.}
<A>__{he folds the order and hands it to dunbar.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i'm wondering sir, how will i be getting there?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{you think i don't know?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no sir, it's just that i don't know.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{hold your tongue.}
<A>__{the major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty window. he can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on a heavily loaded wagon.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i'm in a generous mood and will grant your boon. you see that peasant... he calls himself timmons... he leaves this very afternoon for your fort sedgewick. ride with him if you like... he knows the way. that is all.}
<A>__{dunbar stands and salutes. fambrough returns it snappily. the lieutenant starts for the door.}
<C>__{fambrough }
<D>__{sir knight...}
<A>__{dunbar turns around. fambrough is standing in front of his desk. there's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser front. he jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and giggles.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i just pissed in my pants... and nobody can do anything about it.}
