<A>__{marion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a five foot wall. she flops over it. the bad arab is right on her heels. he reaches the wall and vaults over. on the other side of the wall, the bad arab lands in a crouch, looks ahead and doesn't see marion. immediately a heavy earthen pot smashes over his head, putting him out. marion steps from an alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end of the walkway. suddenly another bad arab and a new german agent appear in the street at that end. before they can spot her, marion retreats to the alcove again. there is a huge rattan basket sitting there. marion climbs in and closes the top above her. the only witness: the monkey, who is now perched on the fire foot wall.}
