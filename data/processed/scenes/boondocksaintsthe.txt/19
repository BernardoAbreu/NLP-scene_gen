<L>__{interior emergency room day}
<A>__{a potent song takes our ears as the macmanus brothers sit in the e.r. they have already received care. their faces are beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various spots. connor's injuries exceed murphy's. they are both clad in only their leather boots, boxer shorts and worn out old bathrobes. young kids wait for medical attention, as their knife wounds bleed. two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes are ripped and face is beaten. a woman toward the end of the hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable. as the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters. his clothes suggest he's a pimp. he is not injured. he looks around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall. he reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and begins to drag her out. she is kicking and screaming from the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away. (slo mo) the boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go toward the action, but connor's legs give out on him and he falls to the floor. connor, still trying to go after the pimp, crawls towards him. murphy helps his brother to his chair and hold him tight.}
