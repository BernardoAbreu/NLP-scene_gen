<L>__{exterior memorial night}
<A>__{moran drives up. there is an empty police car, the door still ajar.}
<L>__{interior memorial night}
<A>__{taupin is badly outclassed. he feebly fends off an attack, but the knight returns quickly with a savage slice that rips open taupin's stomach and throws him again to the floor.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{be silent.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{leave him alone.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you will be silent!!}
<A>__{the voice is thundering. taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor. his teeth grind in pain. the knight smiles.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i do hope you're enjoying this as much as me.}
<B>__{moran}
<A>__{stands in the entryway. the knight sees him.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{moran draws his pistol. the knight walks toward him,}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{this is nothing that concerns you.}
<A>__{moran levels his gun. the knight raises his sword.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you will leave!}
<A>__{two explosions as moran fires. the slugs slam into the knight, blowing him off his feet. he lies still. moran looks to brenna. to taupin. then he walks closer to the knight.}
<C>__{taupin}
<P>__{(hoarse)}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{taupin curls in a spasm of pain. moran moves closer. the knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart. he isn't breathing. moran bends over slowly to see the knight's face.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{stop. you don't understand.}
<A>__{the knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into moran's chest. the pistol discharges against a far wall. taupin crawls for the knight. moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes. the knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly. moran slides off the sword dead. taupin cuts hard against the knight's chest. the knight gags in surprise and crumples. taupin cuts again, then puts the blade against the knight's gurgling throat.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{in mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum. auditorium nostrum in nomine domine.}
<A>__{he raises the sword.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{requiescant in pace.}
<A>__{and cuts the knight's head off. taupin drops his sword. his breathing quickens. a sensation sweeps over him. taupin drops to the floor whimpering. he sucks in painful gulps of air.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{my god.}
<A>__{taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{conor.}
<A>__{taupin is looking past her. a blood stained hand suddenly grabs brenna's shoulder. she screams. the headless body of the knight stands beside her. the knight's head lies on the floor. the eyes open. the face pulls into a smile.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{and now you know.}
<A>__{the eyes roll up into the skull. the face slackens. the hulking mass standing beside brenna sways, the collapses to the ground.}
<B>__{taupin}
<A>__{is crying. not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something else.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i can't stand it. oh god, i can't stand it!}
<A>__{brenna kneels beside him.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{the scream of your blood. the shriek of trees. stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{brenna sobs.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i'm the last. oh christ, i'm the _last one_!}
<A>__{taupin doubles over in pain. the pain of the whole world trying to force itself into him. brenna tries to hold him. he pushes her savagely away.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i will destroy you. i've destroyed everything i've ever touched! oh god...}
<A>__{he doubles over in pain.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{conor...}
<A>__{he grabs his sword and threatens her.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{_get out_!}
<A>__{sobbing, brenna runs from the memorial. taupin is alone. bleeding. crying. in agony.}
