<L>__{interior max and bella's conservatory night}
<A>__{coffee time.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{having you here, anna, firmly establishes what i've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under achievers.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shame!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, i think it's something we should take pride in. i'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.}
<A>__{a little pause. then william turns to bernie.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bernie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{well, obviously it's me, isn't it i work in the city in a job i don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me. i haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{nonsense. i fancy you. or i did before you got so far.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you see and unless i'm much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money, while honey here, she earns nothing flogging her guts out at london's seediest record store.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{yes. and i don't have hair i've got feathers, and i've got funny goggly eyes, and i'm attracted to cruel men and ... no one'll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you see incredibly sad.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{on the other hand, her best friend is anna scott.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{that's true, i can't deny it. she needs me, what can i say?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{and most of her limbs work. whereas i'm stuck in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. and to add insult to serious injury i've totally given up smoking, my favourite thing, and the truth is... we can't have a baby.}
<A>__{dead silence.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bella.}
<A>__{bella shrugs her shoulders. bernie is totally grief struck.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{no. not true...}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{c'est la vie... we're lucky in lots of ways, but... surely it's worth a brownie.}
<A>__{william reaches for her hand. max breaks the sombre mood.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, i don't know. look at william. very unsuccessful professionally. divorced. used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy around the edges and absolutely certain never to hear from anna again after she's heard that his nickname at school was floppy.}
<A>__{they all laugh. anna smiles across at william.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so i get the brownie?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i think you do, yes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait a minute. what about me?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry? you think you deserve the brownie?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well... a shot at it.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you'll have to prove it. this is a great brownie and i'm going to fight for it. state your claim.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, i've been on a diet since i was nineteen, which means basically i've been hungry for a decade. i've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really and one day, not long from now...}
<A>__{while she says this, quiet settles around the table. the thing is she sort of means it and is opening up to them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{... my looks will go, they'll find out i can't act and i will become a sad middle aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.}
<A>__{silence... they all look at her... then.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{nah!!! nice try, gorgeous but you don't fool anyone.}
<A>__{the mood is instantly broken. they all laugh.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{pathetic effort to hog the brownie.}
