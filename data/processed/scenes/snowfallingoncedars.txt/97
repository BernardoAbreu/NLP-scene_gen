<L>__{interior kabuo's cell night}
<A>__{kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back against the wall. leaving the cot. for his guest.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but the toughest scenario. is the one hooks will never raise.}
<A>__{kabuo watching. quiet. takes a breath...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{that you came upon carl by accident. like you said. gave him the battery. like you said. asked him about the seven acres. like you said.}
<A>__{the hardest. straightest. look.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{only. he said no.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and something...happened. that you'd never planned. because you're not a cold blooded killer.}
<A>__{nobody flinches. nobody blinks.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i'm more a hot blooded killer, huh? like a soldier. like a samurai.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you won't hear that from hooks. because the charge is first degree murder, which requires premeditation. he can't change the charge.}
<A>__{do you understand?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so if the jury thinks you did kill. but only in the heat of anger. they have to acquit.}
<A>__{do you?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and you couldn't. be. re tried.}
<A>__{kabuo's face is stone. a warrior's mask.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you want me to say that.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i want you. to tell the truth.}
<A>__{there is no kindly smile tonight. no candy bars.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you think that is the truth.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i told your wife. trials aren't always so much about actual truth. as about what folks believe is true. that's sad. and it's real.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{and what do you believe?}
<A>__{nels sighs. cocks his head just to one side.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{a question first. why do you want to know?}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{because you're my friend.}
<A>__{the old man thinks about that. studies his client.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i believe you are a good man. who belongs with his family.}
<A>__{and then the feeling comes. to the watery eyes.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and i believe. you didn't do it.}
