<D>__{there's no reason why this this savage personal note }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{the personal note is all there is to it. it's all there ever is to it. it's all there every is to anything! stupidity in our government, complacency and self satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you can't fight those things impersonally. they're not impersonal crimes against people. they're being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue, brad, that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.}

<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you. when you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. remember the working man? you used to defend him quite a good deal. well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. and listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together that's going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i don't know what you'll do sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.}
