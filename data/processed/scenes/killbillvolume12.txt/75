<T>__{we cut back and forth :}
<A>__{between cartoon images of this and the real life real mccoy samurai sword battle. o ren's ability is simply amazing.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{when it was all over, it was the geisha regaled o ren ishii that proved the victor.}
<L>__{interior japanese night club}
<A>__{o ren has just become the official leader of crime in the city of tokyo. the six yakuza clan bosses, each with two bodyguards standing behind them, toast their new leader, with much laughter and drinking...all except one...boss tanaka.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{and just in case you're wondering how could a half breed japanese chinese american become the boss of all criminal activity in tokyo, japan,... i will tell you. the subject of o ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once. the night o ren assumed power over the crime council.}
<A>__{boss tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the alcohol fueled frivolity.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{the man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is boss tanaka. and what boss tanaka thinks is...}
<A>__{boss tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces. the party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the tanaka crime family.}
<P>__{crime family leader #2 (japanese)}
<D>__{tanaka? what's the meaning of this outburst? this is a time for celebration.}
<C>__{boss tanaka }
<D>__{and what exactly should i be celebrating? the perversion of our illustrious council?}
<A>__{the bosses all react with shock and outrage...o ren remains cool. she raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it for the rest of the sentence.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{gentlemen...boss tanaka obviously has something on his mind. allow him to express it.}
<C>__{boss tanaka }
<D>__{my father...}
<P>__{(looking at a clan head)}
<D>__{...along with yours and...}
<P>__{(looking at another)}
<D>__{...along with yours, started this council. and while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today.}
<A>__{the bosses react again...o ren;}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{silence!}
<P>__{(then composed)}
<D>__{of what perversion do you speak, tanaka?}
<A>__{boss tanaka looks at the female half breed american and says;}
<C>__{boss tanaka }
<D>__{i speak, mistress ishii,....of the perversion done to this council, which i love more than my own children,...by making a half chinese american its leader.}
<A>__{then... faster than you can say jimminy cricket,... o ren's samurai sword is unsheathed... boss tanaka's head is liberated from its body... the head hits the floor... and from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of blood shoots up in the air. the bosses who were shocked at tanaka's words are even more flabbergasted at o ren's resonse. the two bodyguard's, standing behind boss tanaka, hands go to their swords and draw them. o ren turns her blade in their direction. the bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch. the lady looks across at the two men and says in and authoritative voice;}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{fight me or work for me.}
<A>__{they look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{drop them on the ground.}
<A>__{they do.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{get behind me.}
<A>__{they do.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{get on your knees.}
<A>__{they do.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{put your foreheads on the floor.}
<A>__{they do.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{keep your mouths shut.}
<A>__{you better believe they do. the mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her. as she speaks english, bodyguard translators translate for their bosses.}
<D>__{o ren i'm going to say this in english so you know how serious i am. as your leader, i encourage you to from time to time and always in a respectful manner, and with the complete knowledge that my decision is final to question my logic. if you're unconvinced a particular plan of action i've decided is the wisest, tell me so. but allow me to convince you. and i will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo...except the subject that was just under discussion.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese) (to a bodyguard)}
<D>__{hand me that head.}
<A>__{he picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the queen. she takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{the price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or my american heritage as a negative is, i collect your fuckin head.}
<P>__{(now completely american)}
<D>__{just like this fucker here. now if any of you sonsabitches got anything else to say, now's the fuckin time.}
<A>__{nobody says anything.}
