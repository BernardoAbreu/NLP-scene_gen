<A>__{pov harry and sturge night lurching about in a grappler's waltz below the window. in the b.g. the old man can be seen leaning down to the walkway, picking up the stingy brim hat and returning it to his head. she turns from the window to see a subdued andy entering, her eyes showing signs of recent weeping. behind her in the hall, moncrief can be seen greeting red layls. joan moves over to her...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{... and in response to andy's stoical nod:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<P>__{(embracing her)}
<D>__{what did that bastard do to you?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i need a kleenex.}
<A>__{she moves toward the nightstand with joan following:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you know what they're trying to do, don't you? to force you into signing some kind of agreement that...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{wait, i want to tell you what he said to me...}
<A>__{she extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{he said i was the only woman he's ever really cared for...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{and when he said it...}
<P>__{(blowing her nose)}
<D>__{... he had a tear in his eye...}
<A>__{joan's jaw goes slack in disbelief.}
<B>__{on red}
<A>__{glancing sourly at the two women, as he and moncrief enter.}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{well this moves to the top of the list, red, as one of your more stunning achievements.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{get me something cold to drink, will you?}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{certainly.}
<B>__{on sisters}
<A>__{speaking in hushed, and in joan's case, urgent tones, while, in the b.g., moncrief exits to the hallway.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{andy, you don't know what you're saying. you're suffering from hostage syndrome or something.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, after all i do love him.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you 'love' him?!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yes, he's been a very important man in my life, you know that.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(raising her voice)}
<D>__{oh, now he's not a fecal faced, great white shark!}
<A>__{andy looks over at red, now seated in one of the two chairs in the room. moncrief can be seen re entering and joining him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i don't know where she got that.}
<P>__{(back to joan)}
<D>__{will you please keep your voice down. he's very sensitive to what people say.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{'sensitive'? have you lost all your beads?! this man had you kidnapped and kept in a drugged stupor for the last three weeks, and now he's...}
<B>__{on harry}
<A>__{stepping into the doorway, holding struge in a painful armlock:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{alright, what the hell's going on in here?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{that's the dog trainer.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i thought he was working for us.}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{well there seems to be a little grey area there, red.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{come over here, i want to talk to you.}
<A>__{harry releases sturge and moves over to layls, offering his hand and trying to maintain his gruff manner:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{mr. layls...}
<A>__{joan looks with dismay at harry's apostasy as he shakes "the great man's" hand, then quickly returns her atten tion to andy:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{will you listen to me! this man is not only a bastard, he's a scummy, soul less little thug and a criminal!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{are you implying that i have defective judgement in men, joanie?}
<A>__{red and harry, as before. in the b.g., a hospital employee wheels a cart holding several glasses of iced tea. moncrief moves over to the cart and the employee exits.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just want a say, that though you're someone in a category i admire, you've gone to some lengths on this thing here, that i don't entirely agree with...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{sit down. i have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay. no problem.}
<A>__{as he seats himself in the other chair, red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by moncrief:}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{but i want to go on and finish my thought on this, because...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you know, i'm not in the best of health right now, and i've been advised to avoid excitement...}
<A>__{harry takes a second glass from moncrief:}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{so if you intend to do that...}
<P>__{(after a sip of tea)}
<D>__{i might just have to have my shock troops blow your brains out.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, uh huh.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(holds the glass up to moncrief)}
<D>__{more sugar.}
<B>__{on joan and andy}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{and furthermore, this 'sensitive' man's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as probably mine, into a block of cement!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh that's just all talk...}
<P>__{(calling over to moncrief)}
<D>__{would somebody please get me my clothes!}
<B>__{on harry and red}
<A>__{(in the b.g., sturge exits on another flunky errand.)}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{just put yourself, harry, for a moment, in the shoes of a man whose sole intention is to leave the world a better place than he found it, only to discover those intentions have been painfully slandered by someone he'd given both his heart and his economic support to, not to mention his trust...}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(nodding his head)}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<B>__{on joan}
<A>__{looking over at harry, protesting loudly:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{harry, i can't believe you're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not nodding my head, honey, i'm just listening to the man.}
<B>__{on andy}
<A>__{as harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange with red:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{who is this guy, anyway? isn't he a little sleazy, joanie, a bit infra dig? i mean lewie's a bit of a stiff, but...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you're going to talk to me about sleaze, when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning?!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, 'him.'}
<A>__{she looks to the chauffeur, re entering with her clothes.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh 'him'?! he came at me with an ax!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, he's very immature.}
<A>__{before joan can respond, she crosses to take her belongings from sturge, and as she moves toward the bathroom: joan's pov of the beleaguered maiden she hoped to rescue, pausing on her way, to lean down and kiss the cheek of the dragon she meant to slay.}
<B>__{on joan}
<A>__{as moncrief steps up to her, offering a glass of tea:}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{miss spruance, would you care for a...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{she moves past him, striding over to harry and red:}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{excuse me!}
<B>__{on red}
<A>__{raising a baleful eye to joan:}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{i don't know what kind of spell you've cast on my sister, but it doesn't extend to me...}
<B>__{on joan}
<A>__{standing above layls:}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{in fact, i've been to the police and i intend to press charges against you...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honey, he's not supposed to get excited.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(overlapping him)}
<D>__{... not only for having my apartment burglarized but for breaking into andy's house, as well as hiring someone to frighten, harass and intimidate me!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, maybe you better not...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, dammit!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he's got a bad neck...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of these snakes!!}
<A>__{she looks defiantly from harry to moncrief, then back to red, who regards her coldly for a moment, then:}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i never much cared for you, young lady. and i find your display of anger both unattractive and unfeminine.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to red)}
<D>__{now wait a minute...}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{i'm not here to beg your good opinion...}
<A>__{under the following, red's beeper begins signaling:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{... red layls or not, you don't insult this party in my presence.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{... or to find out the right amount of attractiveness and likability i'm supposed to render up!}
<A>__{without removing his eyes from joan's, he raises the beeper to his mouth and presses the speaker button:}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{doctor park is trying to reach you.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{tell him to hold on.}
<P>__{(then, to joan)}
<D>__{first, you assume far more interest in you on my part than exists. i had nothing whatsoever to do with your supposed misfortunes...}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(very emphatic)}
<D>__{i don't believe you!}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{and as regards andy's house, i'd have no need to break into andy's house, because i own andy's house.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i don't care whose house you own, you're nothing but a slimy, mean minded little hood!}
<B>__{on andy}
<A>__{partially dressed, stepping into the doorway and combing her hair as she addresses joan:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{will you please stop interfering in my personal life, joanie.}
<A>__{red lifts the beeper to his mouth again:}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{i just want to go out to the yacht and get a little color back, for god sakes...}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{red? i've got good news. we've found one for you.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{andy, you know something?}
<A>__{as she moves over to andy, red gets up, paces around with the beeper and his and parks' voices are muffled in b.g.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{the kind of woman you are is a danger to the kind of woman i am, so the next time you and your boyfriend have a domestic spat, don't call me!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well if you're going to take this kind of grumpy attitude, i certainly won't.}
<A>__{and as she goes back into the bathroom, joan turns to harry:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{harry, where are my clothes?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{uh...}
<A>__{he stands up and red steps into frame beside him, a distressed look on his face as he listens to park (v.o.):}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i think they must be outside.}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{i'm over at poly medical. how soon can you get over here?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{will you go get them please, i'd like to leave.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{wait a minute, don't rush me on this, monroe.}
<A>__{harry moves around red and steps up to joan:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can i just talk to you for one minute first?}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{i'm not rushing you, but we don't have the luxury of waiting too long either.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{there's nothing for you to say, harry, it's very clear what your priorities are.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{well, i want a hell of a lot more information before you start carving me up.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honey, all i've been trying to do, from day one, is look out for you...}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{don't you believe that?}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{i can tell you this much, red, i've taken a look at it and i'm very excited.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{will you people be quiet, i can't hear this.}
<P>__{(to the beeper)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{joan and harry are forced to listen to the following exchange:}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{it's as sound a muscular bag as i've ever seen and the pericordium is a gorgeous color.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{well whose heart is it? give me a profile.}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{i don't have any specific data, but the host was around 35 and she was obviously very healthy.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{godammit, monroe!}
<A>__{he begins pacing anxiously again, the camera following him:}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i told you i don't want a woman's heart!}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{don't worry, it's not going to change you in any way.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{how do you know?! you don't know that!}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{look, let's just get it done.}
<A>__{as red paces toward the open bathroom door, harry and joan resume their discord:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{in other words, you don't trust me.}
<C>__{park }
<D>__{and later if you find you're unsatisfied with it, we can always get you another one.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{would you please get me my clothes.}
<A>__{moncrief steps in beside joan:}
<C>__{moncrief}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you a moment ago, that i was privileged to see you at the bowl on the fourth of july...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so what. i'm talking to this lady...}
