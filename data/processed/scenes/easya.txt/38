<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{the scene looks the same. olive sits with her family, having family dinner.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i got sent to the principal today.}
<A>__{her parents seem more impressed than upset. this is definitely a first.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i used inappropriate language in english class. but we're reading a book that i, personally, deem wildly inappropriate for my age group, so i felt that it was actually quite apropos.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<P>__{(more curious than angry)}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{let's just say it was an inappropriate word.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{what did it start with?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{a snide comment from a snotty ass girl in my class.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{i meant what letter did it start with?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{oh. yeah. t.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{t? that's an odd one. is this one of those new curse words?}
<A>__{both her parents wheels are going. they're both seeking the answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing.}
<C>__{rosemary }
<D>__{was it ?}
<A>__{she leans over and whispers something in her daughter's ear.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i don't even know what that means.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{yeah. neither do i.}
<A>__{her parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to them.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{okay. noun, adjective or verb?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{noun. definitely slang. think british, although they pronounce it differently.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{well, i'm stumped. whisper it in my ear.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i can't. too weird.}
<A>__{excited by the prospect }
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{oo! oo! spell it with your peas!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{now, that's a challenge.}
<A>__{she begins maneuvering her peas around the plate.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night?}
<A>__{olive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues to manipulate her food.}
<C>__{dill }
<D>__{is there something you want to tell us, kiddo?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm spelling it out for you as quickly as i can.}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(desperate for attention)}
<D>__{i got a b plus on my spelling test today.}
<A>__{too intrigued by olive's admission to really care }
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{good, sweetheart.}
<A>__{rosemary figures it out as olive is assembling the a.}
<C>__{rosemary }
<D>__{oh, i know what it is!}
<A>__{she leans over and whispers it in dill's ear. he nods in understanding.}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(glancing at olive's plate)}
<D>__{what's a twat?}
<A>__{olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{it's a word that will get you sent to the principal's office.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<P>__{(whispering into ginger's ear)}
<D>__{it's not a good word.}
<C>__{rosemary }
<P>__{(to olive)}
<D>__{so, what was the principal like?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{the male equivalent.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{of what?}
<A>__{now, it's dill's turn to whisper in rosemary's ear. she nods in understanding.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{well, it's the first time since second grade, so i guess we can't be too hard on you.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(genuinely curious)}
<D>__{what would my punishment have been otherwise?}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{i dunno. to bed without supper?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{but i'm already finished. except for my helpful and profane peas.}
<C>__{dill}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{uhhhh. this grounding thing seems to be taking the country by storm. no phone, tv or... or....}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i will help you out. i don't have anyone to call. i haven't watched tv since they cancelled `the illegitimate children of the real housewives of laguna beach' and i really only watched that as a joke.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{fine. i'd take away your }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{books? computer?}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{yes! you're computer!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{all my homework's on there. sorry. you lose. but thanks for playing.}
<C>__{dill}
<P>__{(smiling warmly)}
<D>__{i guess then i'm lucky this isn't a regular occurrence.}
<A>__{olive gets up from the table and kisses her dad on the cheek.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i think we both are. i wouldn't know how to be grounded any more than you know how to ground.}
<C>__{dill}
<D>__{i love you.}
<P>__{(whispering in her ear)}
<D>__{and i'm sure that girl was acting like exactly what you called her.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(whispering back)}
<D>__{you have no idea.}
<A>__{she goes over and kisses her mom on the cheek, as well. leaving the dining room }
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{how's about i go and punish myself? mea culpa, mea culpa.}
<A>__{she retreats upstairs.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{how come you guys never get mad at her?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{because, pumpkin, of our three darling children, we love her best.}
<P>__{(erupting into laughter)}
<D>__{just kidding! now eat your dinner.}
<A>__{dill chuckles, but ginger is not amused.}
