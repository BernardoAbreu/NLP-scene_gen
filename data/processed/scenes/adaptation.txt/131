<A>__{orlean drives through swampy landscape. she talks to us.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{i suppose what i'd been doing in florida was trying to understand how people found order and contentment and a sense of purpose in the universe by fixing their sighs on one single desire. now i was also trying to understand how someone could end such intense desire without a trace.}
<A>__{orlean stops at a payphone and dials. it rings for a while.}
<C>__{laroche }
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{yeah what?}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{hello, john, it's susan.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{yeah hi.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{so, how's everything going?}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{great! i'm training myself on the internet. it's fascinating. i'm doing pornography. it's amazing how much these suckers will pay for photographs of chicks. and it doesn't matter if they're fat or ugly or what.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{that sounds good.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{it's great is what it is.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{so i've been meeting a lot of orchid people, going to shows, i thought you might want to hear about it.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{sorry. i am officially no longer interested in orchids or the losers who are still interested in them. the end.}
<A>__{laroche hangs up. orlean looks off into the flat distance.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{if you really loved something, wouldn't a little of it always linger?}
<A>__{she turns to the camera.}
