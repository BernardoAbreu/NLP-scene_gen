<A>__{bill slides behind the wheel. the keys are in the ignition. alice hops in on the passenger side. bill turns over the engine. it grinds away but does not catch. from an angle behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine fail to catch. we look in the mirror and see someone standing in the distance, watching. bill gets out of the driver's side. slams the door. the camera trucks with him as he opens the door to the engine. alice joins him as he shines his light on the engine.}
