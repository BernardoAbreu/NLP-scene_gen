<L>__{ext day: the garden (1955)}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i see you have your luca brasi.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will need him.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{there are men in this world who demand to be killed. they argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. these people wander through the streets calling out "kill me, kill me." luca brasi was like that. and since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...i made him my weapon. because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. i think you have done the same with this man.}
<A>__{they walk through the don's vegetable garden. tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. michael follows; the don turns and looks at him. then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{barzini will move against you first.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{he will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. that person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...}
<A>__{he rises, and looks at michael...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{...and at that meeting you will be assassinated.}
<A>__{the don walks on further.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{your wife and children...you're happy with them?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{michael wants to express something...hesitates, then:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've always respected you...}
<A>__{a long silence. the don smiles at michael.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{and i...you.}
