<L>__{interior living room. day}
<D>__{jenny, her mother and father are finishing sunday lunch. jenny's father jack is in his forties, marjorie, her mother is slightly younger than jack, but every bit as middle aged. the food is grey and brown, in keeping with the colour scheme of the house. they aren't talking they're listening to mantovani on the radio. jenny gets up from the lunch table.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i've got an english essay to do by tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon, apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{cello?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no cello.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i thought we agreed that cello was my interest or hobby?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's already your interest or hobby. when they ask you "what's your interest or hobby?" at your oxford interview, you can say, "cello". that wouldn't be a lie. you don't need to practise a hobby. a hobby is a hobby.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{or interest.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{you don't need to be good at it. you just have to be interested in it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i stop going to the youth orchestra, then?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. the orchestra shows you're a joiner inner. universities like joiner inners.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{ah. yes. but. i've already joined in. so now i can stop.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, if you stop, that shows the opposite, doesn't it? that shows you're a rebel. they don't want that at oxford.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. they don't want people who think for themselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(missing the sarcasm, as is his wont)}
<D>__{course they don't.}
