<L>__{interior super duper stereo shop day}
<A>__{a semi high end stereo store in the valley. buck, dressed in his usual cowboy digs, is talking to a customer about a stereo unit. the manager, a skinny white guy with a mustache and mustard suit, jerry (30s) is standing nearby.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{ so basically you're gettin' twice the base, cause of the tk421 modification we got in this system here.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i don't know do i need that much bass?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{if you want a system to handle what you want yes you do. see this system here. this is hi fi. "high fidelity." what that means is that it's the highest quality fidelity.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{it's the price }
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{i have this unit at home.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{. . . really . . . ?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{yes. but i've got it modified with the tk421, which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two, maybe three quads when you really crank lemme put another eight track in so you can get a better idea what i'm talkin about }
<A>__{buck ejects the eight track that was playing and puts in his own of a country western song.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{hear that bass? it kicks and turns and curls up in your belly, makes you wanna freaky deaky, right? if you get this unit as it is it won't sound like this without the modification and we do that for a small price.}
<A>__{the customer listens another moment, then;}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{thank you for your time.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{the customer exits and jerry approaches buck.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{. . . the fuck was that?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{wha?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{have i told you? huh? have i?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{what? i don't }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{alright: a.) you play that country western crap and no one's gonna buy a stereo. you throw on some kc and the sunshine band, a guy looks a particular way and you've seen the profile sheet you throw on some led zeppelin. no. instead, you play this twingy twangy, yappy dappy music. what kinda brother are you anyway, listening to that shit?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{hey, jerry, look }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{no, you look. i gave you a job here because i thought your film work might bring some nice pussy in the place and it has but i can't have anymore fuck ups you dig?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{alright. go unload the new 484's from the back room.}
<A>__{buck goes to the back room.}
