<A>__{the suv parked a discreet distance away. rayburn grinds out another cigarette, mutters to himself.}
<L>__{interior creasy's room dawn}
<A>__{bruno lets him in. nothings been touched. creasy retrieves his bullet from his shrine along with the 'jack', marlboros, and new testament. puts his few possessions in a bag. move with him as he silently crosses out into the hall, heads toward... pinta's room he stands there a moment. his pain entirely his own. and then he goes to pinta's little desk, finds her school notebook buried in a pile. he flips through it until he finds... the license plate number pinta jotted for him. then he notices the notebook is really a diary. every page references her day to day relationship with creasy. "i love you creasy bear." he hears soft footsteps. creasy turns. lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes drilling through creasy.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you let them take her. she loved you and you let them take her.}
<A>__{creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why are you here? why didn't you die?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{because...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i was already dead.}
<A>__{eyes brimming, lisa has no more words. but creasy comes bearing cold comfort.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i want you to know something.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to kill them. anyone who opens their eyes at me.}
<A>__{lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is suddenly monumental. finally, creasy looks away. he picks up pinta's battered, old teddy bear.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{creasy...}
<A>__{he turns, but she doesn't look back at him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{kill them, creasy.}
<A>__{creasy nods. he will. as he continues away...}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{kill them all.}
