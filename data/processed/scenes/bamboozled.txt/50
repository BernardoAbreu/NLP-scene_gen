<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i strongly feel that a negro should direct this. this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. one misstep and we're doing "amos and andy." only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{to hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. it's un american. i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i want a hot, young white director. maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{you're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i just want you to meet him. keep an open mind.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{besides, what does he know about negroes?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. a black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? with this kid, the possibilities are endless.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{if spielburg can direct "the color purple" and "amistad", our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{that's exactly my pointerior has he even directed actors before in anything?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{no!!! just meet the guy. that's all i'm asking. look, i will even let you choose your own musical director. you can have that.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{in the immortal words of derrick coleman, whooopdeedamndoo!!!}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{derrick coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. didn't want it bad enough. delacroix, do you want it? bad enough to kill for it? do you want it that much.}
<A>__{delacroix stares at dunwitty.}
