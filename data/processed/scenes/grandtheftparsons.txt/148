<C>__{phil}
<D>__{he meant a coffin.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he didn't say 'coffin'. he said 'body'. tell me we haven't stolen a real person.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}

<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i'm gonna check inside that box just as soon as we're out of here.}
<A>__{they both stare out of the window. phil bangs the cuffs against the wheel.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{they sit glowering out of different windows at different bits of desert. the motorcycle cop can be heard talking into his radio.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what?}

<A>__{larry mulls this over.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what about if i could slip out of these cuffs?}
<A>__{phil treats the theoretical question with indifference. con tinue d: (2)}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah, that would be great. then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no, really. i really can slip these cuffs.}
<A>__{he has phil's attention now.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{okay. show me.}
<A>__{larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. he hands the other cuff to phil, who stares at him in astonishment.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{do you think we should go?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yes, i think we should go.}
<A>__{larry starts the car. he throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire. larry slams on the brakes.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{nicely done.}
<A>__{he rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{we'll be moving on, now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress.}
<A>__{bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike. the cop chases them.}
