<D>__{don't walk away. okay?}
<A>__{he acts as if he just noticed her.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she gestures toward his hearing aid.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is it working? do you need to check it?}

<D>__{it's fine.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{dad...}
<A>__{but the kitchen door opens. we hear the party going on out there. larry and sharon's mother enter, her mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened. larry is raging in a near whisper.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{sharon, please.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{please? please what?! will you stop protecting him? you were always protecting him! don't talk to your father. don't bother your father!}
<A>__{she turns to her dad.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm going to bother you for one minute, dad. okay? can you handle that?}
<A>__{larry advances on her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{just get the hell out...}
<A>__{and she turns on him in a fury that halts him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{this isn't about you, larry or you, either, mom. this is between me and my father, so leave us alone for one goddam minute!}
<A>__{she turns back to her father.}
<C>__{sharon}

<D>__{i want to know!}
<P>__{(then, quieting)}
<D>__{do you want me here? do you love me, dad? i want to know.}
<A>__{the question's out, and she's totally exposed now and the silence that follows breaks her heart. she nods toward his hearing aid. her voice is close to a whisper, thick with tears.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{do you... need to... check that again?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i feel like...}
<A>__{he can't finish it.}

<D>__{what, dad? you feel like what?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i feel like i don't have a daughter anymore.}
<A>__{she takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes show the depth of the pain. she speaks quietly, softly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{well... you do. it's a shame you're going to miss knowing her. you're going to miss all that.}
<A>__{and she leaves, brushing past larry and her mother.}
