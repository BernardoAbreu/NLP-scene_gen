<L>__{interior enterprise ready room night}
<A>__{picard is at his replicator unit.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{earl grey, hot.}
<A>__{a cup of tea appears. he takes it as the door chime sounds.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{come.}
<P>__{(deanna enters)}
<D>__{counselor.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{do you have a moment, sir?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{of course, sit down.}
<A>__{he sits at his desk she sits across from him.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{it's about data i've watched him with the b 9 and i'm troubled. data's desire for a "family" is very strong. i'm afraid he may be investing too much in the b 9.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you're speaking of emotional investment?}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{the b 9 is like a slow child, sir. and data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. i'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. he'll be disappointed when the b 9 cannot meet those expectations.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{as much as we care for him, deanna... we have to remember that data isn't capable of disappointment.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{i don't believe that, sir. we've shared many disappointing journeys.}
<A>__{a quiet beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm going to miss you.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{and i you.}
<A>__{they are interrupted by a comm signal:}
<D>__{riker (v.o.) (on comm) captain, you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{acknowledged...}
<P>__{(deanna stands)}
<D>__{... i will talk to data}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{she goes. picard activates his desktop viewscreen. admiral kathryn janeway appears on picard's monitor. janeway is the former captain of voyager. her new rank fits her well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down to earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{admiral janeway. good to see you.}
<C>__{janeway }
<D>__{jean luc... how'd you like a trip to romulus? all expenses paid?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{with or without the rest of the fleet?}
<C>__{janeway }
<D>__{a diplomatic mission. we've been invited, believe it or not. seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. the new praetor, someone called shinzon, has requested a federation envoy.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{new praetor?}
<C>__{janeway }
<D>__{there's more... as always. he's reman.}
<P>__{(picard is surprised)}
<D>__{believe me, we don't understand it either. you're the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. get the lay of the land, if the empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{understood.}
<C>__{janeway }
<D>__{we're sending you all the intelligence we have, but it's not much. i don't need to tell you to watch your back, jean luc.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not with the romulans.}
<C>__{janeway }
<P>__{(smiles wryly)}
<D>__{the son'a, the borg, the romulans, the evil soran and that pesky nexus. you seem to get all the easy assignments!}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{just lucky, admiral.}
<C>__{janeway }
<D>__{let's hope that luck holds. janeway out.}
<A>__{the transmission ends. picard sits for a moment, intrigued. then he goes to the bridge}
