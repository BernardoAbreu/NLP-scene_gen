<A>__{room 806. day drummond in his hospital shift, gaunt and mad as a prophet, sits rigidly on his chair. barbara perches on her father's bed. bock wanders disorientedly about the room, staring incredulously first at barbara and then at her father.}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{so last night, i coshed miss campanella with a sandbag, sedated her with thorazine, shaved her, prepped her, and parked her in a corridor of the x ray department for five hours.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{why x ray?}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{well, at x ray, a sedated body lying around unattended for five hours wouldn't seem unusual.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{her operation that is to say, mrs. mangafranni's operation was not scheduled until nine thirty. so at nine fifteen this morning, i rang for my nurse...}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{you rang for your nurse?}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{to insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{i got up, wheeled miss campanella off to the operating rooms, replaced her bed with mrs. mangafranni's, exchanged charts and identity bracelets. she died officially of anesthesia shock. but, in point of fact, she died because she was wearing another woman's identity.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(to bock)}
<D>__{god, what do we do now? let me take him back to mexico. it's a simple world there. if you turn him in, they'll just cage him in the rockland state hospital for the criminally insane. let me take him back, herb.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{are you kidding? we'll both take him. i'm going with you! get him dressed. we're getting out of here before the police put us all in rockland state.}
<C>__{drummond}
<D>__{i haven't finished my work here. i have this welbeck to dispose of. i am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh dear, he's having another revelation.}
<A>__{bock holds drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his arm. he finds the entranced drummond as rigid as a statue.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{look, that ambulance must be here by now. you go down and get them. i will give him a shot of something to knock him out. we'll take him to the airport in the ambulance.}
<A>__{they both hurry out of the room. drummond remains enmarbled in his trance. camera suddenly moves down to william mead, whose eyes now open; he has heard it all. in background, drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of dr. schaefer's uniform. he puts them on, tucking in the tails of his hospital shift. he notices william mead staring at him.}

<D>__{you're hallucinating again.}
<A>__{william mead just stares at drummond. eighth floor, nurses' station and lobby area bock and barbara come hurrying around the corner from the west corridor. barbara heads for the elevators. bock heads for the nurses' station. the eighth floor is going about its normal 1:15 p.m. activity. mrs. donovan is at her desk on the phone.}

<D>__{yeah, you gotta send me somebody... oh yeah?}
<A>__{bock moves past mrs. donovan and into the pharmacy where we see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe. an elevator arrives, disgorging milton mead and his resident assistant, thomas hitchcock and, of all people, dr. richard welbeck himself. barbara and dr. biegelman go into the elevator. the doors close. milton mead and hitchcock head for the west corridor. welbeck, in his natty double breasted suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the nurses' station.}

<C>__{welbeck}
<D>__{oh, dr. bock. can i have a few minutes of your time, sir?}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he starts to pass mrs. donovan and would continue, but welbeck lays a restraining hand on his arm.}

<C>__{bock}
<D>__{i'm busy, welbeck.}
<C>__{welbeck}
<D>__{i'd like to know what you have against me.}
<C>__{bock}
<D>__{you turned up half stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago, botched it, put the patient into failure and damn near killed him. then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in montego bay. this is the third time in two years we've had to patch up your patients; the other two died. you're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self inflating and unconscionably profitable. aside from that, i have nothing against you. i'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf. what else do you want to know?}

<C>__{william mead}
<D>__{i'm telling you, milton, he pulls out all the wires and the tubes, and he gets up and puts on a doctor's uniform, and he goes out, and he murders doctors! he just went out ten seconds before you came in!}
<A>__{indeed, there is no drummond to be seen. his bed is empty. bock nods to milton mead and hitchcock, who nod back, and crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is likewise empty.}
<C>__{william mead}
<D>__{and i will tell you something else about this crazy place you got here! there was a naked indian in here last night doing a war dance! that's the kind of crazy place you're running here, milton! you got to get me out of here, milton. this is a crazy place, milton!}

<D>__{i will be down directly.}

<A>__{others in the troop shout reassurances, but it doesn't really reassure anybody. the lady in the gift shop closes her door and locks up. people crowd in a solid block in the doorway to the coffee shop to see what's going on. from the long tunnels of corridors, nurses, doctors, administrative personnel pause in their chores and errands and missions to watch the tide of events in the lobby. holly pavilion, executive corridor the exit door is wrenched open, and bock comes hurtling into the carpeted executive corridor toward the lobby, and at that moment the troop of militants come rumbling in from the other end. every door of the corridor fills with secretaries and administrators unsure of what's happening. then, sundstrom elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his doorway and comes into the corridor. he regards the militants moving down the corridor toward him.}
