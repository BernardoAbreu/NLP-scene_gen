<A>__{x close. journal. a not too loopy feminine hand, writing the words we are hearing.}

<A>__{reveal... erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically transformed wild child. a shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.}
<C>__{erin's voice }
<D>__{that they're together now. fighters. united by love. and anger. that they've given also to me.}
