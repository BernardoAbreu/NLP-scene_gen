<L>__{interior ratmobile, downtown chicago day}
<A>__{julianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep michael's cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it is not going well!}
<A>__{down the block, michael whips around a corner. we follow suit to see his destination dead ahead. union station. the dispatcher radio intrudes...}
<C>__{dispatcher }
<D>__{uh, unit four baker charlie, how we cookin' on that skokiie infestation?}
<A>__{now she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is what comes of telling the truth!}
<C>__{field man }
<D>__{copy, dispatcher...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{or even part of it!}
<C>__{field man }
<D>__{uh, what happens if you got that methyl ethyl shit on your hands?}
<A>__{michael rips into the train station's parking lot. we swerve around a taxi, cut off h: arley, careen into the lot...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{getting what you deserve is not fair!}
<C>__{dispatcher }
<D>__{uh, you got maybe thirty seconds before you're sterile. for god's sake don't touch yourself, or anything.}
<A>__{up ahead, michael is out of his jeep and running.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and i hate talking to your machine!}
<A>__{she slams on the brakes, throwing herself against the wheel.}
<C>__{younger field man }
<D>__{uh, this is one monkey zebra. it wasn't bees in the gal's wall, it was cats!}
<A>__{she tears the door open. scramble out...}
<C>__{younger field man }
<D>__{she says gas 'em, anyway, she'll pay cash. uh... how do i pay this?}
<A>__{with julianne now, racing through the lot, michael vanishes into the station, she plunges in after him, bouncing off bystanders, apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion, threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk, catching a lucky glimpse as he heads... ... down a staircase to the tracks. my god, what's he doing? a second wind, fueled by panic, and she bolts after him, dancing down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for... ... track 29, a train already rumbling, ready to pull out, she sprints after him.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael!!}
<A>__{he disappears behind the train, she falls, skids, springs up, pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train pulls}
<B>__{away...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{nnnoooo!!!}
<A>__{but he's just standing there. his back to us. watching it go. her body nearly collapses with relief. she pushes herself on, but her legs aren't working right in their maxed out fatigue, and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him. he's still lost in thought, staring after the train. she tries to speak, but there's no breath. so she puts her hands on her knees and just gasps for air like a dog. wheezing, panting, trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually turns and... ... jumps out of his skin! a heart attack seeing her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(croaks)}
<D>__{don't speak!}
<A>__{he just blinks at this sweaty, ripped up, maniacal figure.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{uh. i saw that moving...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{don't speak!}
<A>__{flinging both her hands across his mouth. a frozen beat. he nods, okay. cautiously, she takes her hands away. at least she has made him smile, in spite of everything. at least she's done that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i have to make a confession. another confession. besides that i love you. this is even worse.}
<A>__{this. he's waiting to hear.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{the e mail? you thought walter sent your boss? i wrote that.}
<A>__{you. what?! synapse overload.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(stricken with remorse)}
<D>__{... wrote it, yeah. i'm the bad guy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<A>__{she nods her head wildly, hair flopping.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{are you absolutely insane??}
<A>__{bigger nodding.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{are you on drugs???}
<A>__{shakes her head, like a two year old.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(pacing in circles)}
<D>__{i mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, i mean... i mean... how could you do that?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i didn't know it would get sent. i just wanted you to... get mad at kimmy... and...}
<A>__{and watching. as this begins to sink in.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i've done nothing but slimy, underhanded, despicable, not even terribly imaginative, things. ever since i got here. trying to...}
<A>__{staring in his eyes. eyes she can't read at this pointerior}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... to win you. to win you back.}
<A>__{tears in her own eyes now. big ones.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and i was blinded by love. like you said.}
<A>__{shaking her head...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but that doesn't excuse any part of it. i am pond scum.}
<A>__{no...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{actually. lower. i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum. lower. the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{lower.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{lower.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.}
<A>__{and to her amazement. the trace of a smile...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{on the other hand, thank you.}
<A>__{she blinks at that. which squeezes out a tear.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{for loving me that much, that way.}
<A>__{he shrugs. just above a whisper...}
<C>__{michel}
<D>__{it's pretty flattering.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{except it makes me fungus.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, that part i knew.}
<A>__{she's never loved him more.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so you have to marry kim. because she will actually make you happy. i, in contrast, am a shallow, neurotic psychopath, with relatively little to offer.}
<A>__{okay?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{kim. nod your head. do as you're told.}
<A>__{he nods his head, still smiling. her tears are running now. maybe she doesn't notice.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{just promise you'll never tell me who you would have chosen. if i hadn't confessed.}
<A>__{she chokes back a sob.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{cos if you would have chosen me. then i threw away a perfectly good life. just to be a decent person. which is a questionable trade off. right?}
<A>__{he nods, slowly. because he's supposed to.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and if you would have chosen some 20 year old punk over me. i'd have to kill myself.}
<A>__{ah. his smile keeps getting smaller. more loving. more wonderful.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i will take it to my grave.}
<A>__{good. she looks around.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i came here, looking for her.}
<A>__{for her. the words leave a silence.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{why would she come here...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is where i proposed.}
<A>__{stares deep in her eyes. she needs to hear this.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i had to cover a game in milwaukee. she saw me off. and when the train started to leave... i jumped up on the step, i help the handle, and without...}
<A>__{he grins. has to admit...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... without a thought in my head. i shouted, "marry me."}
<A>__{i did. now her eyes tear up again. and she doesn't know why.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and she gasped, and covered her mouth, and the train was pulling out, and suddenly she screamed yes! just once. and blew me a kiss.}
<A>__{what a girl.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i never forgot that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's two weeks.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{almost three.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that is so romantic.}
<A>__{which makes him reach and touch her hair.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i just wonder if you know why.}
<A>__{do you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings. that's not the real romance.}
<A>__{tears in his eyes now. first time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the real romance is saying yes.}
<A>__{does she know that now? he looks at his watch.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{woulda been a nice wedding.}
<A>__{oh. that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{you can't believe you've lost her! sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{course, if it's later rather than sooner, i'd hate to be you at six o'clock.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've got a lot of explaining to...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm just thinking of how she's hurting. lost. alone. like her life is over.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that's little egotistical.}
<A>__{he glares at her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but, undoubtedly accurate.}
<A>__{she claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{okay, we'll split up. you go to every romantic place you guys have, i will go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if you find her...}
<A>__{strange tone. a gentle warning.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the kiss. may be hard. for you to explain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because the only fear she really has, is...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... me, yeah. and she likes tommy lasorda. case closed.}
<A>__{looks at her own watch. shit!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but if you do get to her first...}
<A>__{she looks up.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there is something you are authorized to say.}
