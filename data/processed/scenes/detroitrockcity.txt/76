<L>__{exterior it's raining men strip joint night}
<A>__{hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by for a ticket, getting the same stock answer: "suffer, dude!" he stops and sits on a curb, lighting a cigarette. behind him stands the marquee for it's raining men, the male strip jointerior a disco song comes from inside. just when it looks like hawk's given up, a voice is heard above.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, chief? need a ticket?}
<A>__{hawk can't believe his ears. he looks up at a greasy looking hybrid, part porn star, part used car salesman, the scalper.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{second row center, seventy five clams.}
<A>__{trying to act confident, hawk takes out his money clip showing the scalper twenty five dollars.}

<D>__{where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{the easy way.}
<A>__{the scalper points over his shoulder and hawk turns to see three giggling women exiting the strip jointerior none are under forty. a sign below the bar's logo reads: amateur night giveaway! guys over 18 only! bare it all and win 75 bucks!}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{you look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i can't just walk in and take my clothes off. it's embarrasskin.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. and in detroit no less. well, take care, chief.}
<A>__{the scalper turns and hawk grabs his arm.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{dude, if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it, i'd give it my best shot. i'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. but this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way too spontaneous for me.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{hey, i invented fake i.d.s, alright. that's not the problem... they're playing disco music in there, man.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{chief, here's a little secret. drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. now shit or get off the pot. do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers?}
<A>__{hawk gets a look of resolve on his face.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{you sure you'll have a ticket for me?}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{you have my solemn oath as a public servant.}
<A>__{hawk turns and walks up to the door, hesitating before opening it. rummaging through his pockets, he pulls out a handful of expired driver's licenses. choosing the one he thinks best suits himself, he walks in with trepidation. the scalper sees someone else coming up.}
<C>__{scalper}
<D>__{hey, chief, you need a ticket? second row center, seventy five clams.}
<A>__{it's trip.}
<C>__{trip}
