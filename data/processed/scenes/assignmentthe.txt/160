<A>__{we begin on a shot of ramirez's chair. it rocks back and forth violently as we pan up and see ramirez, who is fucking maura. they are both fully clothed, skirt hiked up, fly unzipped. this is not lovemaking. he is fucking her brains out. it is passionate, rough sex. maura hits high "c" as ramirez sweeps books off of a table, lifts her out of the chair and lays her out on the table. the two of them climax together. it is clear from maura's look that this is the best sex she's ever had. ramirez slowly rolls off her. he is smiling as well, and then becomes aware that maura has begun to cry.}
