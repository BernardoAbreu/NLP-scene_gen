<L>__{exterior desert house dawn}
<A>__{the storm is over... no sand blowing. no wind. no nothing. complete silence!!!! the dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one of a cluster, set at the end of a 'doom town' cul de sac.}
<L>__{interior '50's house same time}
<A>__{in the darkened bedroom, early's solitary figure rustles atop the bed. slowly, he awakens. his eyes open. across the bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. in the other cuff is carrie's motionless hand. then, out of the corner of his eye, early sees something in one of the nearby rooms. curious, he stands, shoves the .45 automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway. as he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment. early's pov a blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps around the front door frame... it looks like a magical "door" shrouded in a wall of light!}
<B>__{on early}
<A>__{in disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... the morning sun rising. with that he turns his attention back to the front door!}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{i knew there was doors out here!}
<A>__{he walks toward the doorway of light. he grins as he opens the "door" and steps through it. the sunlight momentarily blinding him. early's pov a black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... eventually it blocks out all the light until... whaamm!!!!}
