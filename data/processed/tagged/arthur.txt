<L>__{exterior manhattan night}
<A>__{a homeless man, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in manhattan's deserted night time financial district. the street starts to vibrate. a terrifying growl approaches. a huge black shape smashes into view the dark knight's batmobile! our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. the homeless man dives for cover. bam! the batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars. we hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `wall street'. sirens herald three police cars in hot pursuit. the batmobile roars up wall street, bashing against the new york stock exchange, thumping up and down the federal hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'charging bull' statue. two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the batmobile's bonnet and roll away. the cop cars screech up, surrounding the batmobile. two older cops and a rookie surround it, weapons drawn. a helicopter appears, blazing the batmobile in white light.}

<D>__{it's a joke! okay, okay.}
<A>__{arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. the bronze bull teeters, a little scarily. he stands, wobbly. his batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses. and, inexplicably, a big red stapler. the younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.}
<C>__{older cop 1}
<D>__{okay, explain everything.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{well. what with having spunked 1.6 million fat alberts on this little runaround, i thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne er do wells? it worked for the billionaire bruce wayne, why not the future billionaire arthur bach templemead? will i have to do traffic school?}

<A>__{a very precise french waiter performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan. susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously.}
<C>__{waiter }
<D>__{...the chef has bathed the bass in a parceline of chilean fennel and finished him with a little gift of kobe beef. also i have a progressive tasting of kumamoto oysters en gelee which evolve on the palate, from light and refreshing to complex and spicy. a short story with a twist at the end! le fin.}
<A>__{susan chuckles approvingly, knowingly, the twit. she coos with delight and claps in appreciation.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{do you have something with less words please? the chef doesn't have to re cook it, just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he's just joshing, dominic. i will do the skate in wood ear mushroom.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{excellent decision. sir?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{a bowl of champagne and a spoon.}
<A>__{the waiter leaves, despising arthur.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{arthur, did you really have to be so icky to dominic?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just can't handle the whole specials act. it's not a shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu.}
<A>__{a wine waiter slams a bowl and spoon next to arthur. he pours in champagne.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you know, i was grumbling to your mother about how things are with us sometimes. how i'm sure you're trying to drive me away...}
<A>__{arthur slurps his champagne.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{um hm.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but she was explaining that relationships are like property purchases; invest only in high end stock, avoid anyone 'up and coming', then hold onto the property through thick and thin to deliver maximum return! isn't that darling?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out? sorry, joke. i'm not suggesting pimping you.}
<A>__{arthur sees a very frail, rich old woman dripping in diamonds, passing by on her walking frame.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{look. you after our first child is born.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{arthur. why can't you learn to laugh at genuinely amusing things?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{youtube clips of babies giggling. dane cook.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{susan. why are we together?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i love you, arthur. and you love me, whatever you think.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we don't have the same sense of humour. we don't like the same films, food, music. you like horses, i think they're arrogant idiots...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't they say opposites attract?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that depends on the opposites. racists and the nation of islam don't secretly want to 69 each other. susan, you're beautiful. you're bright. you're fucking loaded. is there really no one else who could make you happy?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{never?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, i had a thing at college. that was serious for a while. but daddy...}
<A>__{she stops herself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{daddy what? prayed to jesus for it not to work out, then shot the bloke behind a meat truck? because jesus would consider that cheating.}
<A>__{susan places her hand on arthur's.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ask me, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur takes susan's hand.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{susan. you're the only woman...at this table.}
<A>__{a waiter tops up susan's wine. arthur, now very drunk, holds out his champagne bowl to be refilled.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're not happy, arthur. nobody who drinks like you can be happy.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how do you know? what if the drunker i get the better it is for me? not everyone who drinks is a poet, susan. some of us drink because we're not poets.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with susan's fish and arthur's drink.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{a real woman could stop you from drinking.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it'd have to be a real big woman.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ask me, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur sinks to his knees. susan waits...and waits. arthur has passed out. susan kicks him awake. he fumbles away in the gloom, getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her finger. at table level, susan waits, irritated.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{all done.}
<A>__{susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting diamond pushed onto the end of her thumb.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{susan. would you marry me? take the weekend if you want...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, i will marry you.}
<A>__{she nods imperceptibly at the waiter.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{ladies and gentleman the happy couple!}
<A>__{music starts. a congratulatory round of applause. confetti is thrown. the whole restaurant cheers. susan whips out her blackberry and starts hitting keys.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{erica will be the planner.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{erica? she hates me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{who i love, she loves.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, come on. she always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an uzi.}
<A>__{susan's phone rings.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(answering)}
<D>__{hello...thanks, daddy! sorry, hang on, i have erica calling...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's going on? i only just bloody proposed!}
<A>__{arthur's phone rings. the caller i.d reads `vivienne'. he kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate.}
<L>__{interior pierre hotel basement garage night later}
<A>__{in the gloom we track past the crushed batmobile, the delorean and other famous cars, to find arthur sitting in kitt from `knight rider'.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{what have i done, kitt? this mistake's up there with hitler joining his school debating team...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{go to bed, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur jumps out of his skin. but it's hobson, standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{and stop this self pitying bibble. you're going to be fabulously rich.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{maybe i'd rather be fabulously poor. some poor people i see look happy.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{that's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. arthur, poor people have to work. they stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{don't patronise me. i have a job.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work i mean. and i don't want to see you suffer. take your fish oil.}
<L>__{interior naomi's apartment, queens night}
<A>__{a very old apple mac sits on a cluttered desk. ralph is in his chair, eating popeye's chicken n' biscuits, watching csi on an old tv with a tiny satellite dish on top.}

<D>__{when are we getting cable?}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{we have satellite.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent store!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's a satellite dish!}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{i read the box! it said `no satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals!' that's like saying `hey eat this plate of broken glass! it won't make you fat. 'cause it's glass!'}
<A>__{naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. she checks her hair in the mirror.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's better than nothing.}
<A>__{ralph unplugs the dish. the picture improves.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{no it ain't. honey, i love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom. and she bought food from yard sales.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i miss her too, daddy. but now she's gone and if i'm going to keep you in grits and oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{but you live like you're preparing for a war. and you earn a decent salary.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{so? i want to know i can look after you.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{what's he do, this english bum?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{who cares? he's nice. he's funny.}
<A>__{on csi, a female body is being unearthed.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{yeah and i bet that girl said the same about her date. honey, stay home. i don't want you ending up like that poor girl.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{a bad actress holding her breath?}
<A>__{she changes the channel to something else.}

<D>__{on a first date? are you crazy?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{trust me.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{arthur. we're in battery park at night. i've met you once in the company of your nanny. you make a disturbing number of jokes about stalking and basements. my dad already has you down as a mass murderer. and you want me to put on a blindfold?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i give you my word if i kill and eat you, you'll never see me again.}
<A>__{she shrugs and puts on the blindfold.}
<L>__{exterior night later}
<A>__{arthur guides naomi in the dark. she stumbles.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{okay, i'm officially a little worried.}
<A>__{she tries to pull her blindfold off.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{don't worry!}
<A>__{arthur removes her blindfold. she's stunned to find herself on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous candles. before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all time. flowers are everywhere. a log fire burns in a grate. soft music plays.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you said you wanted a picnic.}
<A>__{he pours them glasses of 1928 krug.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{arthur, i don't know what to say. it's beautiful.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{who did all this?}

<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{did you take account of the heroin fairies who hang here at night?}
<A>__{but there's nobody there. a cool breeze blows. naomi shivers. arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's nice to keep it simple like this. i'm sick of michelin star restaurants. all that embarrassing crap with the specials.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{are you kidding? where i normally eat, the special's the one that comes with a free toy.}
<A>__{arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks.}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i get by.}
<C>__{naomi}

<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{craziest thing you ever bought?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed 100,000 to open a falafel stall.}
<A>__{she laughs. she stops laughing.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{oh my g d, you're serious.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i once said the manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `you've got mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime.}
<A>__{a sudden, very loud, very out of date ring tone. naomi takes out a huge ancient motorola phone.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{yes, dad? there's a small tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it.}
<P>__{(phone bleeps)}
<D>__{gotta go, battery. love you too.}
<A>__{she ends the call.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{mom died last year. for eight months dad ate nothing but popeye's chicken n' biscuits in front of csi. so i persuaded him to move in with me. where he eats popeye's chicken n' biscuits in front of csi.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sounds like you're very good to him.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what are you gonna do? all those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the tv. and then one day, you're the one saying `no, honey, it's bad for you! go to bed.' weird, huh?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(not relating at all)}
<D>__{yeah. i hate that.}
<P>__{(looks at her phone)}
<D>__{nice bit of kitsch. where did you find that?}

<D>__{at&t store in 1998.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's...you've had it twelve years?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's a fine phone. battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations.}
<A>__{something weird is happening. the world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away. she hasn't noticed yet.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{i can't believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit. cds come along, so out with the vinyl. vinyl's back in, out with the cds. i just kept the vinyl. way cheaper, and i get to be incredibly hip once every 20 years....}
<A>__{a beat. she looks around. and down.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it which is being lifted off the ground by a crane!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. so it's a picnic in the sky! isn't it ace?}
<A>__{the whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{no it is not ace, you crazy english bastard! this is dangerous!}

<A>__{naomi tastes it. it's clearly delicious. she gazes around as the crane swings them out over the hudson. the view of manhattan, of the river, of the statue of liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here. naomi bursts out laughing. she sips champagne.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what the hell. gotta go sometime, right? at least it won't be years of pain like mom. just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so anyway. the tours...}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(calming herself)}
<D>__{okay, okay. be deep. breathe still. the tours are a temporary nine year fill in until i'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round.}

<D>__{what did you write?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{a kids' book. i sent a chapter to a childrens' publisher. sunshine press'. the rejection letter was the meanest thing i ever read.}
