<B>__{tombstone tombstone}
<A>__{an original screenplay by kevin jarre}
<D>__{fourth draft march 15, 1993}
<A>__{roll prologue over main title: a collage of old photos, prints, etc., and silent live action vignettes, all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly remembered dream. the first images show the opulence of the gilded age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their violence....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"the economic explosion following the civil war created an unprecedented nation wide market for beef. previously worthless cattle running wild throughout texas were gathered into herds and driven north to the railheads in kansas. fortunes were made as cowtowns sprang up on the prairies, wide open centers of commerce and vice, their streets choked with heavily armed young men fresh from the cattle drives. in those days the correct term for a cowhand was 'drover'. 'cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used. but these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street. in fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern new york or los angeles and there was no law but that of the gun."}
<A>__{a dashing figure in a prince albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin navy colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest. next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols flashing around the room like a strobe light:}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"straight up at 75 yards or eye to eye at point blank range, the greatest gunman of all time was an illinois abolitionist farm boy named james butler hickok, better known as wild bill, the prince of pistoleers. but wild bill worked his trade on the side of justice and as marshal of cowtowns like hays city and abilene he became a legend, the one man who stood between law and chaos."}
<A>__{now hickock sits facing us, playing poker as a shabby looking figure with a gun steals up behind him and fires.....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"wild bill's fame spread nation wide but his end came quietly in the spring of '76 when a strange cross eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his head, apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a celebrity."}
<A>__{now a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner, raising hell as 2 mustachiod young lawmen walk up, trying to quiet them down.}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"in dodge city meanwhile, wyatt earp and bat masterson were becoming known as fast guns. but their fame had nothing to do with shooting."}
<A>__{seeing it's hopeless, the lawmen whip out their pistols and start clubbing the drover's making them stagger and grimace, holding their heads....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"earp and masterson operated more like modern policemen, using teamwork and persuasion to keep order. still, sometimes things got out of hand."}
<A>__{an armed drover creeps up behind the lawmen, about to fire....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"but wyatt had a guardian angel."}
<A>__{a reed thin figure with a sawed off shotgun steps from the shadows behind the drover and fires. the huge blast whites out the screen for an instant, making the drover seem to disappear. the lawmen spin around. the thin man breaks the shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed. earp looks at him in shock, mouthing the word "thanks".}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"john henry 'doc' holliday was the son of an aristocratic, highly cultured southern family. trained in philadelphia, he had embarked on a career as a society dentist when he contracted tuberculosis. advised to practice in the west where it was thought the climate and clean air would prolong his life, doc soon realized it was all only a matter of time and gave up dentistry to become a professional gambler and gunman..."}
<A>__{the scene shifts to an elegant victorian home: a stern jewish patriarch orders his darkly beautiful daughter upstairs as her weeping mother looks on. the girl huffs up the stairs followed by her little white dog. next, the girl and dog are seen escaping through a window to the street below and a waiting cab.}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"others headed east. bent on becoming an actress. josephine marcus defied her wealthy and very proper san francisco jewish family to run away with a traveling theatrical company, braving the perils of the frontier on her own. dangerous as this might seem, it was another age and women were so rare, their presence so cherished that they could travel virtually anywhere in the west in perfect safety."}
<A>__{now we see horsemen silhouetted against the night sky, a hand knocking on a door, figures conferring in darkness, then more riders, moving west in restless haste toward the rising sun....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"at about this time the texas rangers, having eliminated the commanche threat, turned their attention to the outlaw gangs marauding along the rio grande, cleaning up the border strip in 4 years of hard riding. those they could not indict or convict the rangers put down in their black book, letting it be known that they could either leave texas or face summary execution. this resulted in the mass migration of the absolute dregs of the texas underworld to the most dangerous, uncivilized part of the entire country, the southeast corner of the arizona territory."}
<A>__{a jagged, moonlit landscape, a lone prospector and his burro moving along a ridge, a pick digging into a rocky ledge, an ore car emerging from a mine shaft, finally a hilltop cluster of tents becoming the skeletal wood frame beginnings of a town....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"harsh and inhospitable, savaged in turn by the apache and mexican bandits, this had always been an accursed place, a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself could never prosper, much}
<C>__{v.o. narration }
<D>__{less civilization. then in 1879, a prospector named ed schiefflin set off alone into the dragoon mountains. friends told him he was crazy, that the only thing he'd find in this godforsaken place would be his tombstone. instead he found silver, lots of it, and overnight the town of tombstone sprang up. mining taking out millions in ore. land value shot sky high and speculators and gamblers and opportunists of all nations scrambled in by the thousands to make tombstone queen of the boomtowns, so rich that the latest paris fashions, hard to find even in the biggest cities, were sold there by the wagonload from the makeshift storefronts."}
<A>__{an engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving north, a newspaper story of a massacre in mexico, congressmen railing at each other, shaking their fists....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"meanwhile, the exile texans had banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang. seizing controp of the surrounding countryside they robbed stagecoaches at will while the big absentee business interests employed them as tax collectors and strongarm men. but the backbone of their trade remained border rustling, periodic raids into mexico to steal cattle while engaging in what was described as a virtual orgy of murder and violence. the raids became so frequent and so bloody that the mexican government formally protested to u.s. president chester a. arthur, prompting heated debate in congress. general sherman declared that the only possible way of bringing order was to send in the army but in the wake of civil war reconstruction federal intervention in civilian affairs was politically impossible."}
<A>__{pounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night riding horsemen kicking hell for leather across the desert moonscape....}
<C>__{v.o. narration}
<D>__{"with only some 100 members, the gang was an elite body of gunmen, known by the red silk sashes they wore around their waists. fiercely proud of their terrifying reputation and answerable to no one, they were a law unto themselves, finally emerging as one of the earliest examples in american history of full scale organized crime."}

<A>__{burning daylight, hard reality. a squad of uniformed mexican rurales rides through the sonora desert, sabres glinting in the sun. approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard bitten captain signals them to stop, leaning down to study a jumble of hoofprints on the ground. he turns to the anxious looking young rurale on his right, speaking in spanish via subtitle:}

<C>__{captain}
<D>__{turn around! fast! now!}
<A>__{but suddenly gunfire erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death. then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the captain, the young rurale, and a 3rd rurale alive. dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed figures emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them. with broad brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates. these are the cowboys: old man clanton, the ageless, white bearded leader; curly bill brocius, 2nd in command, smiling, bull necked; ike and billy clanton, the old man's sons; florentino, a mexican half breed; and johnny ringo, dark, byronic, with an air of something very strange. the old man nods to florentino:}

<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{why sure, dad. i'm only in fun. here she is.}
<A>__{with a reassuring smile, curly bill holds his pistol out butt first. white reaches for it, visibly relieved. but quick as a snake's tongue curly bill spins it around and fires point blank into white's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast so close it sets his clothes on fire. curly bill turns just as wyatt flashes into frame and slams him over the head with his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap. wyatt glances at white lying semi conscious in the street, chest heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird like sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest. clum runs up:}

<D>__{you. come here a second.}
<A>__{ike steps up, full of brass. without warning wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head back. wyatt cocks the pistol. the other cowboys hush. ike freezes. wyatt's eyes bore into him.}

<A>__{this breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the cowboys disperse. wyatt lowers his pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still groggy curly bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.}
