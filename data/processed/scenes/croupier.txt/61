<A>__{jack pauses in front of an airline office. there is a large picture of cape town, and a special ticket offer. jani comes out of the office. her hair, tied back earlier in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. she sees jack. he doesn't see her.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{thinking of going back?}
<A>__{jack is startled. he doesn't recognise her for a moment. then...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh hello.}
<C>__{jani}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you know what? i'd like to buy you a drink.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{that's stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{impossible to calculate.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jack knew that, in reality, all odds are calculable.}
