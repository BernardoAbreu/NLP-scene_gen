<A>__{a loud humming sound. along the walls are rows of waist high stainless steel boxes. in the room's center are two six foot high round towers. at a single console, a man studies a monitor. dr. wu, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests. he jumps up and knocks over his cup of coffee. assistants clean the area as wu comes forward and actually hugs grant, much to grant's embarrassment.}

<D>__{ah, i knew you two would hit it off! dr. grant, this is dr. wu, my chief geneticist.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{finally, you are here! i've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long. welcome, welcome!}
<A>__{he kisses ellie, who takes it in stride. gennaro, we already knows.}

<D>__{mr. hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science.}

<D>__{don't forget to thank me when you pick up your nobel prize.}
<A>__{hammond and wu resume the tour.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from eden.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{these are hamachi hood automated gene sequencers, those are cray xmp's, supercomputers that take dna information and organize it. in this room, we take fragmented or incomplete dna strands and compare them to other incomplete strands.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{the computers make sever}
<A>__{al trillion}
<D>__{calculations to provide us with a complete dna strand the genetic code of an extinct animal.}
