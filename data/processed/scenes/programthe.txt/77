<L>__{interior fraternity house night}
<A>__{the post game victory party is in full swing. all the players, their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking, celebrating. bud lite and joe stand drinking beer, watching the action.}
<C>__{bud lite}
<D>__{i don't know, i never seem to make out at things like this.}
<A>__{bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with louanne.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't make out anywhere. or did you finally break the snatch barrier this summer?}
<C>__{bud lite}
<D>__{fuck you, bobby.}
<P>__{(realizing louanne's there)}
<D>__{excuse me, louanne.}
<B>__{angle on darnell}
<A>__{sitting across the room with alvin but his attention is on autumn and ray out on the dance floor. alvin notices.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{forget it, nigger. no chance for you there.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{griffin's goin' to medical school. she likes that light skinned respectable shit. you're just her ghetto toy.}
<A>__{darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where ray and autumn are standing. a slow tune plays.}
<C>__{darnell}
<P>__{(to autumn)}
<D>__{can i have this one?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{what are you so worried about? you haven't lost your starting job yet.}
<A>__{autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(turning to ray)}
<D>__{just one.}
<A>__{ray reluctantly backs off. darnell and autumn start to dance. several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them as they move around the floor. they try to pretend they're just having a nice little chat.}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{take it easy, darnell. this isn't a good time to push things. you're putting me in an awkward position.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeh, well, i got a little encouragement along the way.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{that kiss... it was just... a kiss.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{bullshit. you meant it. i wouldn't be standing here now, everybody thinkin' i'm a stupid asshole, if i didn't know you meant it. i wanna see you, autumn. not in study hall. not like your student. like somebody to be taken seriously.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i do take you seriously, darnell, but i'm still with ray. i can't just go paradin' around town.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i don't need to go paradin'. we'll go someplace different. someplace nobody'll see us.}
<A>__{she looks at him a long beat. she doesn't need this complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{god, why am i even considering this?}
<A>__{the song ends. ray moves in to reclaim her.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to darnell)}
<D>__{all caught up on your arithmetic?}
<A>__{darnell, pissed, gives ray a shove.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12 carries.}
<A>__{ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by joe and bud lite, step between them. darnell shrugs them off and leaves the party.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to bud lite)}
<D>__{just what we need, a little team unity.}
<A>__{ray takes autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm gettin' a little sick of this asshole, autumn. i don't like you hangin' out with him. it's embarrassing.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i don't hang out with him. i tutor him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{then have him get another tutor.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i can't do that. i made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam. i can't bail out on him now.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what the hell difference does it makes? they'll grease him through no matter what he does. nobody's ever gonna see his graduation. don't tell me you're falling for this guy. he's just another gang banger with speed.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i just said i wanted to help him. what are you more afraid of, losing your girl or your position?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{maybe you oughta think about what you're in danger of losing.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{maybe i will.}
<A>__{autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party too.}
