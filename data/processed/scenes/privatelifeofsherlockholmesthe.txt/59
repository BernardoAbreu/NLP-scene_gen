<L>__{interior third class carriage night}
<A>__{there is the normal complement of passengers, men, women and children, of the middle and lower classes. the only unusual occupants are a group of seven monks, in brown habits and cowls. watson, in valet's livery, comes down the aisle, proceeds toward a window seat where he has left his umbrella and bowler. the resf of the bench is occupied by monks, as is the facing bench. as watson tries to squeeze between them, he steps on the foot of one of the monks.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{sorry, father i mean, friar or is it abbot?}
<A>__{there is no answer from the monk. watson picks up his bowler, settles himself in his seat, starts to fan himself with his hat. he turns sociably to the monk beside him, who is absorbed in his bible.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{going to scotland, you gentlemen? so are we...}
<A>__{as he fans himself the ear pieces of his stethoscope, which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler, dangle down. he quickly shoves them back inside.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i'm a valet. my master and mistress and i are our way to inverness. ever been there? beautiful country.}
<A>__{the monk looks up from his bible, points to his lips, shakes his head.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{oh, forgive me. you must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence. trappists, i believe you're called.}
<A>__{the monk doesn't answer. watson turns away, looks out the window but there's nothing to be seen. then he folds, bored. he glances casually at the bible in the monk's hands. the good book is opened to a page headed: jonah.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i see you're reading the book of jonah. funny we were just talking about johan this morning...}
<P>__{(realizes the hopelessness of}
<D>__{the conversation, breaks}
<P>__{off)}
<D>__{never mind.}
<A>__{he pulls down the shade, closes his eyes, tries to compose himself into sleep.}
