<P>__{(rolling his eyes with a sigh)}
<D>__{lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. look, he's been my best friend since i was eight. and i was not a popular child. you have to understand, i had no friends before he came along. he's the only reason i ever gained any fucking confidence. i coulda wound up like that asian kid at virginia tech, but i didn't. `cause of him. so, y'know, i'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but john, you're not eight. you're thirty five. and unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. you have me. and i love you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i love you, too. you know that.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{look, i've put the best physical years of my life into this. i mean, i'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. i need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not only will i not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `cause i can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so i can see it backwards.}
<A>__{she laughs. so does he.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{and, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you.}

<D>__{i can do it all with one hand.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.}
