<L>__{interior elevator night}
<A>__{the tragic sounding beep of the elevator passing floors. jerry maguire stands with dorothy, both still charged with adrenalin. and then the first pangs of dread. there is silence. the elevator stops. a young, amorous couple enters. both are about 24, and the guy presses a number five flights down. in a moment, we realize they are deaf. they sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. and then the guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the girl emits a delighted gasp, as does dorothy. the couple are truly in their own world. they kiss before exiting on their floor. and suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.}
