<L>__{interior tabby's studio night}
<A>__{tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. kelly dumps the bars and stands there looking around. at the wood floors and skylights. couch covered with a sheet. painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious objects stuck to them lay against the walls. they all seem faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash. kelly moves to the painting on the easel. very yellow and pink. kind of looks like castles.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{gold. the color of the sun.}
<A>__{tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{that's the cleveland waterfront.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{as the viewer, i get to decide what it is, i'm afraid. and it doesn't look a thing like it.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{it's the light. i was playing with diffusion.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well make sure you put it away when you're done with it.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{very funny, wiseass.}
<A>__{kelly resumes his tour of the room.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it must be nice to have a place like this to get away to.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what about farmer?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{farmer?}
<A>__{tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{the boyfriend.}
<C>__{tabby}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{miner? what about him?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is he an artist, too?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{no. definitely not. thank god.}
<A>__{kelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you said your mom was a painter?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{she was, well is i guess.}
<A>__{tabby cuts the canvas.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{she used to be. but then my dad wasn't working anymore so she turned it into a business. she has a family of chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{like andy warhol's factory.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{more like andy warhol's tool shed. it was nice before, though. my playpen used to be in her studio.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{wow. so you really grew up with it. what does, did, your dad do?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he's a vh 1 documentary without the music.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{"tragedy struck?"}
<A>__{kelly nods.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{"and then, things took a turn for the worse."}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well, just wait. those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback tour.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i already changed the channel.}
<A>__{tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him. bart's head appears in the open door.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{christ kelly, i let you go out on a little supply line assist and you're gone for days. come on.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{have fun, boys.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{if only it were fun. war's deadly serious, ma'am.}
<C>__{tabby}
<P>__{(to bart)}
<D>__{and i used to think you were the only crazy one.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{enough with the mind pollution, hanoi hannah.}
<A>__{bart leaves. kelly stands by the door. this is his only chance.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yes. i might have to come by and show you the proper safety procedures. some time in the presence of an art prodigy would do you good.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i don't think i have room for a playpen in here.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ouch.}
<A>__{tabby smiles. kelly leaves.}
