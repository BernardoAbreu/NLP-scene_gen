<A>__{we hear the slow metallic footfalls of the night porter's boots. he appears and walks into a darkened women's ward. the women are all asleep. some coughing fitfully, others moaning quietly. the night porter walks down the aisle between the beds. we see several of the sleeping women as he passes them. finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes wide open, watching him with intense fear. on either side of her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply. the young woman has her arms tied, suspended in traction above her. the night porter moves to her, his shadow engulfing her. she starts to move, rattling the apparatus above her. the porter puts a finger to his lips.}
