<A>__{the mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room. at the far end of a huge banquet table sits darth vader. standing at his side and slightly behind him is boba fett, the bounty hunter. faster than the wink of an eye, han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at vader. the dark lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. just as quickly, han's weapon zips into vader's hand. the evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him.}
