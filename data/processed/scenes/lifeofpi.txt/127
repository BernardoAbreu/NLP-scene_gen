<D>__{thousands of meerkats? on a floating carnivorous island? and no one has ever seen it?}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{yes. just like i told you.}
<C>__{chiba}
<D>__{bananas don't float.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<P>__{(in japanese:)}
<D>__{why are you talking about bananas?}
<C>__{chiba}
<D>__{you said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. but bananas don't float.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<P>__{(in japanese:)}
<D>__{are you sure about that?}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{of course they do. try it for yourself.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<D>__{in any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{i've just told you a long story. i'm very tired.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<D>__{we're here because a japanese cargo ship sank in the pacific.}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{something i never forget. i lost my whole family.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<P>__{(in japanese:)}
<D>__{get him some water.}
<P>__{(in english:)}
<D>__{we don't mean to push you. and you have our deepest sympathies. but we've come a long way. and we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{because i don't know. i was asleep. something woke me up. it may have been an explosion; i can't be sure. and then the ship sank. what else do you want from me?}
<C>__{chiba }
<D>__{a story that won't make us look like fools.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<D>__{we need a simpler story for our report. one our company can understand. a story we can all believe.}
<P>__{(chiba gives pi a glass of water.)}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{so.... a story without things you never seen before.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{young pi}
<D>__{without surprises. without animals or islands.}
<C>__{okamoto}
<D>__{yes. the truth.}
