<A>__{dismayed by each others' close proximity, orthodox and liberal jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom.}
<L>__{interior ghetto apartment night}
<A>__{from the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. in this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non orthodox businessmen, stern and schindler.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{for each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month to begin in july and to continue for one year after which time, we're even.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{he lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to stern, who brought this group together and now sits at schindler's side. the accountant declines.}
<C>__{investor 1}
<D>__{not good enough.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{not good enough? look where you're living. look where you've been put. "not good enough."}
<P>__{(he almost laughs at the squalor)}
<D>__{a couple of months ago, you'd be right. not anymore.}
<C>__{investor 1}
<D>__{money's still money.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, it isn't, that's why we're here.}
<A>__{schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer. it doesn't come. just a silence. which irritates him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{did i call this meeting? you told mr. stern you wanted to speak to me. i'm here. now you want to negotiate? the offer's withdrawn.}
<A>__{he caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat.}
<C>__{investor 2}
<D>__{how do we know you'll do what you say?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{because i said i would. what do you want, a contract? to be filed where?}
<P>__{(he slips into his coat)}
<D>__{i said what i will do, that's our contract.}
<A>__{the investors study him. this is not a manageable german. whether he's honest or not is impossible to say. their glances to stern don't help them; he doesn't know either. the silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door. one of the men eventually nods, he's in. then another. and another.}
