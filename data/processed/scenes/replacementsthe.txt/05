<L>__{31!" it comes out in bubbles}
<A>__{he cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion. then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five step drop. he moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! he executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks "down field" for his receivers. but there's a blitz! he steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. he dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet. he rolls left and keeps looking for the open man. suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm. the "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release. the trophy spins out of frame but we hold on shane as he watches his pass. suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal. we stay on him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash covered, muddy bottom of marina del rey.}
