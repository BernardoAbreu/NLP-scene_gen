<L>__{interior pyramid labyrinth long corridor}
<A>__{angle on: grid and the aliens are watching from the shadows, laying in wait. slowly we move into scar's shoulder gun. it's the only thing keeping lex and scar from being ripped apart. for now. close on grid as the leader of the alien pack suddenly turns. grid has heard his mother's anguished cry for help. interior pyramid labyrinth dead end chamber scar moves in and looks lex over carefully. he could kill her in an instant and she knows it. he looks at her strangely. she stands there, terrified and defiant. and then he walks away, leaving her there.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hey! hey!}
<A>__{she runs up to him. she grabs him. he turns sharply.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{i'm coming with you. you hear me you ugly son of a bitch? i'm coming with you.}
<A>__{scar looks at lex. and lex does the most surprising thing. she simply opens her hand. scar looks at this young warrior, wanting to fight, her hand outstretched and open. and scar places a knife in lex's hand. scar wastes no time. he takes his sacrificial dagger and begins to cut up the body of the dead alien. prising the armored hide away from its internal organs. scar works with speed and precision. lex is both intrigued and repelled.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{scar pulls the armored head plate of the alien away from the rest of its body. he lays it carefully to one side. it is now completely hollow, like an empty shell. lex can see that the long twisted brain of the alien is still pulsing and twitching. even dead like this, the alien is amazingly menacing. after all, how do you really know when an alien is dead? lex leans in for a closer look and wham!!! a claw snatches at her face. lex jumps back terrified. but the alien makes no further movement. maybe it was some kind of reflex action? lex looks from the alien to scar. the predator holds his dagger over the brain of the dead beast. he prods a lobe of the alien's brain and the same claw snatches at the air. he scared her deliberately. a predator joke. lex manages a half smile more spooked than funny that's...great. scar returns to his work.}
<C>__{lex }
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{lex puts a hand on scar's arm, stopping his work. scar stares up at her. clearly not used to being touched. a tense moment. for a second, it looks like the predator may tear lex in half, but then he grabs lex's spear. scar dips the tip of his sacrificial blade in the body of the alien. then, holding the blade above the handle of her spear, he lets a drop of alien blood fall. the acid blood immediately begins to eat its way through the handle of the spear. next, scar holds the blade above the long piece of alien hide that he has just torn from the dead creature's body. scar lets a drop of alien blood fall. the acid blood rolls harmlessly off the alien hide, like it were just a drop of water. the acid doesn't react with the alien's own armor. scar looks up at lex, as if to say "get it?" lex nods.}

<P>__{(distorted version of lex's voice)}
<D>__{keep it together ...}
<A>__{lex is amazed. scar speaks and in her own voice.}
