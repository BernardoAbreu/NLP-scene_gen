<L>__{interior jewelry shop day}
<A>__{jake stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. the jeweler examines the stones.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{didn't you also wish to sell the championship belt, mr. lamotta?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's it. those are the jewels that were in the belt.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{but where's the belt?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you want the jewels or the belt?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{both. these stones are worth about fifteen hudred dollars, but the belt of a champion is a very rare item. the belt with the stones untouched would have been worth near five thousand dollars.}
<A>__{jake seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.}
