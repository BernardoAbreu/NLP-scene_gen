<L>__{interior morgue night}
<A>__{in the morgue, laurel has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms. rosenberg's cat sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. suddenly, the cat looks up, meowing urgently. laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her chair. jay and kay stand in the doorway, staring at her. kay steps forward, holding out that black card again. it reforms into another kind of official id, this time it says "department of public health"}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{...approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post mortem increase in body temperature. examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. which can only be described as...well...as really...}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{weird? dr. leo menville, department of public health. this is dr. white.}
<A>__{she looks up. jay and kay are standing there.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yeah, well whoever you are, i'm afraid i'm going to need to see some id.}
<A>__{he hands her his carte noir, which changes to read "dr. menville, department of public health." she hands it back.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(checking her watch)}
<D>__{you boys must not have much of a home life.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{we watch the morgues very carefully. you've got something unusual?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i'd say so triple homicide.}
<A>__{she gets up and goes to the arquillian's body, which is still out on a table under the lights.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{the first corpse was perfectly normal, except that he was broken in half, but when i opened up the other two well, look.}
<A>__{she throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully dissected arquillian. kay raises an eyebrow; jay nearly retches.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{there's a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything i've ever seen.}
<A>__{kay steps past her, going straight to the body. he begins to examine it.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i will have a look at this one. dr. white, why don't you and dr. weaver check out the other body?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{this way, doctor.}
<A>__{jay and laurel cross the room, to where rosenberg's corpse lies out on another gurney.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{this one's even stranger. i did a full laparotomy. i started with the lesser curvature of the stomach though, if you want, we could begin at the gastro esophageal junction.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i think, uh, we should start at the same place you did.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{jay hears a meow and looks down. rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his leg.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{your cat?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{guess it is now. came in with the bodies.}
<A>__{she snaps one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame), sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside. just by the look on jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is. laurel digs in, up to her elbows. jay winces. she pulls one bloody glove out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face. he looks at her and she winks at him. he's surprised. she laughs.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{okay. dive right in. god knows he won't mind.}
<A>__{jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{you have very pretty eyes.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{thank you, but is this really the time to uh you know, come on to me?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{hey, just walking the dog.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{feel that? where the piloric junction would be?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh, yes. exactly.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{now push that aside. notice anything strange? stomach? liver? lungs?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{nope. all fine.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{doctor, they're all missing.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{well, of course they are. what i'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left. so they're intact, wherever they are. that we can be sure of.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{have we met before? i have the strangest feeling of deja vu.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you know, i was just going to ask you the same thing.}
<A>__{laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued. she whispers to him. confiding in him.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{okay. you wanna know what i really think?}
<P>__{(re: kay)}
<D>__{but don't tell that guy. he looks like he's already under enough stress.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{this body is not really a body, but it's actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether. the question is: what?}
<A>__{jay just looks at her intrigued.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{by the way, stop me if i'm freaking you out.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no, no...not at all.}
<A>__{after a particularly gross gushy sound, he looks away, toward her. she's staring at him. laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{you know what i like to do sometimes? when it's really late?}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(freaked out)}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{from the other side of the room, kay clears his throat.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he walks across the morgue to kay, who is still examining the arquillian. but jay never takes his eyes off laurel.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(of laurel)}
<D>__{very interesting. got a real queen of the undead thing goin' on.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{of the body.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{great body.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{the dead body?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{not a clue.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{all right. keep her occupied. try not to sound too dumb.}
<A>__{across the morgue, laurel is still examining rosenberg, now bent down next to his head, carefully studying his left ear. she notices something strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to jay.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{dr. white.}
<A>__{jay, in conversation with kay, does not respond to what is not his name.}
<C>__{laurel }
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{dr. white.}
<P>__{(still louder)}
<D>__{dr. white.}
<A>__{he still doesn't answer.}
<C>__{laurel }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{dr. white!}
<A>__{kay nudges jay.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're up, slugger.}
<A>__{jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{jay leans down. there is strange stitching around the base of rosenberg's ear.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{he reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. with a soft click it pulls away from the head. like a latch. jay and laurel look at each other, astonished. jay pulls again, and rosenberg's entire face pushes out with a mechanical hum, then hinges open, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull. a tiny little green man sits inside rosenberg's head. though not quite dead, the tiny little green man is gravely wounded. he staggers up out of a small control room inside rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{far freaking out.}
<A>__{they lean in closer. the tiny little green man (a baltian) forces words out of his mouth.}
<C>__{baltian}
<D>__{must to pre prevent }
<P>__{(searching for the word)}
<D>__{ contest? no...to prevent }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it's all right what are you trying to say? struggle?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{war?}
<A>__{the baltian nods vigorously. that's it.}
<C>__{baltian}
<P>__{(faltering)}
<D>__{galaxy on or or orion's }
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{what is word? be...?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{bed? belt? orion's belt?}
<A>__{the baltian nods again, falls, and dies. jay and laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{"to prevent war, the galaxy is on orion's belt?" the hell does that mean?}
<P>__{(turns around)}
<D>__{hey! kay! i mean, dr., uh, whatever, come here!}
<A>__{kay begins over. laurel looks at them.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{"doctor whatever"? you're not with the department of public health, are you?}
<A>__{jay shakes his head but is now paying more attention to kay, as he leads him toward the little man.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<A>__{kay looks at the mess the body, the little dead man.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{rosenberg. damn. good man.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you knew him?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{one of the few i actually liked. exiled high prince.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i was right this is an alien life form, and you're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps...}
<A>__{kay and jay are not paying attention to laurel.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{he said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on orion's belt."}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{... this make total sense. how else do you explain new york? the other night i'm in a cab, this guy...}
<A>__{flash! without even looking at her, kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he said there's a galaxy on orion's belt? that makes no sense.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's what he said.}
<P>__{(to the dazed laurel)}
<D>__{didn't he? right after he }
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake, you did the flashy thing already.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(as if awakening)}
<D>__{uh, hi, whoever you guys are, i'm afraid i'm going to need to see some id if you're going to be in the morgue, okay?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{sure thing, sweetheart. here you go.}
<A>__{flash! he neuralyzes her again. jay slaps his hand.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{stop that }
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(to laurel, ignoring jay)}
<D>__{typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ that thing probably gives you brain cancer!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{never hurt her before.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{"never hurt her before"?! how many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(evasive)}
<D>__{couple.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{aren't you worried about, you know, long term damage?}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(more evasive)}
<D>__{little bit.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i took this job.}
<A>__{he heads out. jay follows.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey, you never flashed me with that thing, did you?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{nah.}
