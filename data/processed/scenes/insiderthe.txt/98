<A>__{the house on the quiet suburban street. a security guard, incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front porch in a metal porch chair.}
<L>__{interior the basement, the wigands' house late night}
<A>__{and we see jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk, alone in the basement, listening to classical music. he instinctively turns. and he sees liane, in her bathrobe, has come down to sit on the basement stairs. he looks over at her. and he thinks she's come down to make up. and all she really wants him to do is say, "i need you..." but he can't... and like ships that pass in the night, nothing's said. it's quiet. she puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets. and she starts to cry...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{i don't think i can do this... i want to stand by my husband... i really do, jeffrey. but i don't think i can do this anymore. i am so sorry...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{can we talk about this when i get back?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{yes...jeffrey.}
<A>__{she goes back up the stairs. and as jeffrey sits in the basement, and the music plays.}
