<D>__{in a private room in the special care baby unit, anna approaches tatiana's baby's plastic crib. the baby is tightly bundled up, sound asleep. through the windows of the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside another world. anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. there we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. tears begin to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.}
