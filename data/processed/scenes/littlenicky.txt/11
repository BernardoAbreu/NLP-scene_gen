<L>__{exterior gates of hell shortly after}
<A>__{we see the coals are cooling down on the road and the damned souls in hell are sneaking off. the demons are baffled and don't quite know what to do. dad, jimmy and nicky walk to the frozen fire.}
<C>__{damned souls }
<D>__{what's going on? where are we?}
<A>__{we keep hearing people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{nothing's getting through that. the fire is solid as a rock.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we gotta get this bad boy burning again. ideas?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{to do that cassius and adrian have to come back through the other way.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{so go get 'em, dad!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm too weak. the process has already begun.}
<A>__{dad holds up his hand. his pink is hanging by a thread. we see the bigfoot monster grunt disgusted by the sight.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{so go get 'em, jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{i'm just a demon, nicky. i don't got devil blood in me. i'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're not saying it's up to me?}
<A>__{the monster puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say, "oh no."}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{i've never been to earth. i've never even slept over at some other dude's house!}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{you're the spawn of satan. you got it in you.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{nicky, the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers?}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{not go. they left together at the exact same time. they gotta come back together at the exact same time.}
<A>__{dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{here. get them drunk from this. one sip and they'll be trapped inside. once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.}
<A>__{dad's pinky is hanging. jimmy pulls it off and examines it. the monster gags.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{your ol' man's got less than a week.}
<A>__{nicky looks petrified.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no. this can't be happening.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{son, just do your best.}
<A>__{nicky looks teary eyed. the moment is broken by the monster, who runs in and pushes nicky through the fire. nicky goes through the solid fire wall. pause. the monster taps his own wrist and looks at dad as if to say, "gotta get a move on."}
