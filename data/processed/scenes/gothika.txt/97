<A>__{miranda's resigned daily grind in quick dissolves a) miranda and the other patients line up for meds in the rec room. b) irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get their daily fresh air. c) wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at night and the lights go off.}
<L>__{interior miranda's cell night}
<A>__{echoing an earlier scene, we are moving towards her her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light. miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. sensing something.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{leave me alone. go away.}
<A>__{just like a crazy person. she listens for any further noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. exhausted.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i've lost my fucking mind. happy now?}
<A>__{silence. but now the bedsprings creak behind her and she whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers her mouth. her eyes open wide at the sight of simon, in his yellow shirt. he shoves her against the mattress and presses his full weight against her. she lets out a muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and brings the plunger to her throat. straight into her jugular.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{this is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me.}
<A>__{she flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down. the bedsprings strain violently and now he's straddling her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. her eyes welling up:}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i've always wanted to do a doctor.}
<A>__{she manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from her throat. it flies to the floor. he grins, enjoying this:}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{the more you fight me, the harder i get, pussycat so pretty please, with sugar on top keep still.}
<A>__{simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend herself. he finally slaps her free arm down. presses his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. now he produces another syringe from his pocket. checks it. miranda shakes her head, pleading. a scream stuck in her throat. but nobody can hear her. simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we hear a loud clanging at the door. shaking it off its hinges. simon looks up, confused. nobody is there. the split second distraction is all miranda needs to shove him off the bed. she fumbles for the discarded syringe and stabs his chest with it squeezes the plunger }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{take that, son of a bitch.}
<A>__{simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body goes limp. miranda exhales, coming back to herself. a beat.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{rachel?}
<A>__{no response. miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress him.}
