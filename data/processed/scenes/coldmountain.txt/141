<L>__{exterior sara's cabin. night}
<A>__{sara walks ahead of inman. she carries a pile of clothing, a pair of boots. it's still wretched outside, she hugs the house, the porch barely offering shelter. inman follows, with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm. she hands him the clothes.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you look about his size. he was another man straight up and down.}
<A>__{there's a palpable attraction between them, so that every exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't even have a blanket.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i got a blanket.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i will leave you the lamp.}
<A>__{by the dim light, inman peels off his clothes, sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. he can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants.}
