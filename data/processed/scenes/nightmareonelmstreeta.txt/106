<A>__{a montage of shots, of the ekg graph, its inky needles calming, of a meter tracing the quieting of nancy's pulse, and of other instruments, indicating life processes we can only guess. all smoothing out. close on nancy on tv monitor, asleep like the child she is. innocent. marge lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness.}

<D>__{what the hell are dreams, anyway?}

<D>__{mysteries. incredible body hookus pokus. truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. as for nightmares...}
<P>__{(leans closer)}
<D>__{did you know that in the last three years twenty philipino refugees in california died in the middle of nightmares? not from heart attacks, either. they just died.}
<A>__{he gives a "ah don' know" shrug. marge looks out into the sleeping room. nancy is a motionless bundle in the middle of the bed. angle on a needle on an ekg dipping to a lower reading. wider angle the mother and doctor watching.}

<D>__{what happened? that needle sank like a rock.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{she's entering deep sleep now. heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. all normal. she could dream at any time now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. waiting to see what shows up.}
