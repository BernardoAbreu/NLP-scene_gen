<L>__{exterior playground night}
<A>__{a beer bottle smashes on the ground. pull back to include its ex owner and his two compatriots, youth gang members, lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground. they sport nondescript punk regalia...torn t shirts, fatigue pants, combat boots or high top sneakers, leather jackets. the leader notices something and sits up.}

<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{hey, hey...what's wrong with this picture?}
<A>__{angle reverse, seen past the lounging toughs, terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose fully toward them. angle over terminator's shoulder, as he approaches them. they slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{nice night for a walk, eh?}
<A>__{terminator stops right in front of them.}
<C>__{terminator}
<P>__{(without inflec tion)}
<D>__{nice night for a walk.}
<A>__{they surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.}
<C>__{second punk}
<D>__{washday tomorrow, huh? nothing clean, right?}
<A>__{terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried. reptilian.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{nothing clean. right.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{this guy's a couple bricks short.}

<D>__{now.}
<C>__{second punk}
<P>__{(bracing)}
<D>__{fuck you, asshole.}
<A>__{without warning terminator hammer punches him in the temple with blinding speed. the blow flings him with a clang into the jungle gym. he drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. the leader whips out his switchblade and slashes in one motion. terminator ducks back and catches the knife wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip. then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. angle pavement, as the knife clatters down. the punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. angle two shot, terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless. their bodies are in total shadow. the punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure. terminator jerks his fist back with a wet sound and the other drops out of frame. the last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror. he backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds he is in a corner. terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous. the punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes. thunder peals overhead.}
