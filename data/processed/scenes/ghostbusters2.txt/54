<L>__{interior dana barrett's apartment night (same time)}
<A>__{she walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over the living room. then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for information about the blackout. she listens to a special news report for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby. she crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door and looks in. suddenly the doorbell rings, scaring her half to death. leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees janosz standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the hallway. he looks slightly dazed and even creepier.}

<D>__{janosz?}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{hello, dana. i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought i'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you you know, with the blackout and everything? are you okay? is the baby all right?}
<A>__{his affected concern is chilling. she is frightened but conceals it from him.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(mechanically and cautiously)}
<D>__{we're fine, janosz.}
<A>__{he tires to look around her into the apartment.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{do you need anything? you want me to come in?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{no, everything's fine. honestly. thanks anyway.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{okay, just thought i'd check. good night, dana. sleep well. don't let the bedbugs bite you.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{good night, janosz.}
<A>__{she closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.}
