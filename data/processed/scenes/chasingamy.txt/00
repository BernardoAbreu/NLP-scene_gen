<L>__{interior comic book store day}
<A>__{a pile of comic books are on a shelf next to myriad others. the most prominent one is called bluntman and chronic'. a hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame. holden opens the comic and flips through it he shakes his head. banky looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{felt like this fucking day would never come. issue two on the shelf.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yippee.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{don't start, alright! this is a cool moment, and i'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it. how often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it!}
<P>__{(points to name on cover)}
<D>__{banky edwards right!}
<P>__{(points to the other)}
<D>__{holden mcneil.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i know my name.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{c'mon, sour puss. we got the rest of our lives to be artists. but it's supply and demand. and right now, the unwashed masses demand this.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{this is easy, alright! and right now it pays the bills. just don't forget that we're better than this.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i will tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here.}
<A>__{they approach the counter, where steve dave, the store manager, and walt the fan boy, play a card game.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(lays books on the counter)}
<D>__{alright old maid's take a break from the crazy 8's marathon and ring us up. steve dave}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{well, well,well, walt did you see who it is! the local celebrities. quick get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple it's value.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i'm not that in need of fifteen cents right now.}
<A>__{they snicker and high five one another. holden rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you guys operate the smallest, ladies' bridge circle i've ever seen.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{for your information, we're playing crimson mystical mages' an overpower card game. not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced as this there are no dick or poopie jokes involved.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{i don't think they're fans.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no, we're not. you're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky. steve dave and obviously your handlers or hangers on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue. and when you get your foot in the door of the business, what do you do! you turn out a piece of shit like bluntman and chronic'.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{tell him, steve dave. steve dave}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{bluntman and chronic'. pah. what was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue!}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{the stinky palm. steve dave stinky palm. you give comics a bad name i tell all my customers not to buy it, to spend their money on a real comic book.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{fucking one hit wonder, dime store frank miller's. steve dave this is the reality at comic toast you're not going to get your ass kissed here, because both me and walt think you suck.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{and me. steve dave i said that.}
<A>__{steve dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then goes back to playing his game with walt. holden and banky stare, shocked. banky nudges holden and they both exit steve dave and the fan boy slap hands and go back to playing.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i've got a dragon card forty power ups and twelve life points! ha! i get your elf card! steve dave you're such a bitch! but thankfully, i've saved a dark forces shaman card for just such an occasion.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you suck! eighty six life power points to my twenty two! steve dave i schooled their asses, now i'm schooling your's.}
<A>__{suddenly. a trash can crashes through the front window. steve dave and walt hit the deck like bitches, covering one another. they look up slowly. steve dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess. he pulls something off the garbage can and reads it.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you know it was those two fucks! let's call the cops and have them busted! i know where their studio is! or better yet, let's sue! you can sue them, steve dave! steve dave}
<P>__{(still reading note)}
<D>__{that won't be necessary.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{what?! why the hell not! steve dave}
<P>__{(holds up check)}
<D>__{because this is a check for three times what that window cost.}
<P>__{(reading note)}
<D>__{dear critics thanks for the insight. but like my grandmother always said fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.. and break their window.' kiss it, banky the hack. p.s. your card game blows.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{he said kiss it!}
