<L>__{interior pits day}
<A>__{commentary from all the world's tv stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as all the drivers come into the pits to change to dry tyres. it's chaos. a traffic jam of formula 1 cars... the ferrari team frantically work. changing niki's tyres. four men with air guns, two men with rapid duty jacks. the same italian mechanic appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..}

<C>__{niki}
<D>__{c'mon...!!}
<A>__{niki screams at the mechanics, who are struggling. the airguns make a high pitched noise...something's not right.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what's going on???}
<A>__{"thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and niki exit the pits in pursuit of hunt. but the delay has cost him dear...}
