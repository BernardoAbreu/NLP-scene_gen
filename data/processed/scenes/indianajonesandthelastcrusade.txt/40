<L>__{exterior venice piazza day}
<A>__{elsa leads indy and brody into the large piazza. people walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{here is the library.}
<A>__{they have arrived at the front steps of the library.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that doesn't look much like a library.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it looks like a converted church.}
<A>__{elsa leads the way inside.}
<L>__{interior the library day}
<A>__{indy, brody and elsa enter, their heels clicking across the marble floor. we notice, along with indy and brody, that the library contains many stained glass windows.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{in this case it's the literal truth. we're on holy ground. these columns over here...}
<A>__{she indicates four huge marble columns that go from floor to ceiling.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{... were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of byzantium during the crusades.}
<A>__{indy glances at the columns, then notices a stained glass window that depicts a knight of the crusades. indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{now please excuse me. the library's closing in a few moments. i will arrange for us to stay a little longer.}
<A>__{the minute elsa is out of earshot.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{marcusi've seen this window before.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{indy whips out the grail diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{right here. in dad's diary. you see?}
<A>__{brody glances at the diary, then at the windownoticing that the roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{look, indy. the roman numerals!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad was onto something here!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.}
<A>__{indy and brody now see elsa approaching. indy quickly tucks the diary back into his pocket.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(explaining to brody)}
<D>__{my dad sent me this diary for a reason. until we find out why, i suggest we keep it to ourselves.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{find something?}
<A>__{indy doesn't reply. he's looking in five directions at once. his eyes moving across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(to elsa)}
<D>__{uh, yes. three, seven and tent that window seems to be the source of the roman numerals.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{my god, i must be blind}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb... he was looking for the tomb itself}
<A>__{elsa wears a blank expression.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{don't you get it? the tomb is somewhere in the library! you said yourself it used to be a church! look.}
<A>__{indy's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{indy looks again to the stained glass window. he points.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{indy has discovered that each column is numbered with a roman numeral. indy hurries away toward column vii. all brody and elsa can do now is try to keep up with him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{he points again to the stained glass window.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{seven... ten.}
<A>__{he looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{and ten. now where's the ten? look around for the ten.}
<A>__{indy walks past aisles of book lined shelves. he stops, turns, then looks down.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{three, seven and ten.}
<A>__{he climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a loft and looks down at brody and elsa. the floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge "x"visible only from this higher angle.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{ten.}
<P>__{(wryly; to himself)}
<D>__{"x" marks the spot.}
<A>__{indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the center tile where the two sides of the x intersect. he blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot. indy rushes past brody to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained glass window. indy raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the librarian stamps a book. the librarian regards the stamper curiously. indy continues to pound at the tile as the librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the sound echoing through the library. finally indy breaks the tile. as he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a two foot square hole is revealed. cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{bingo.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{you don't disappoint, doctor jones. you're a great deal like your father.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{except he's lost, and i'm not.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{lower me down.}
<A>__{indy is impressed with elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. when her feet finally touch ground below, indy releases his grip on her and slips the grail diary to brody.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look after this for me, will you?}
<A>__{then indy disappears into the hole.}
