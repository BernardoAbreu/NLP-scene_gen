<L>__{interior torture room #1 ida's cabin basement}
<A>__{mike steps into the room, the light from the hall spills into the room, falls across... sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. she's bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches. sheryl and mike's eyes lock. euphoria, pain all at once.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{mike runs to her, touches her face. he checks the ropes tying sheryl. they're very secure.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i need something to cut you down, baby.}
<A>__{sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room. mike follows her gaze... searching wildly... scanning the room... a tool bench... tools... tools! on a tool bench a litany of the conventional and unconventional. a hammer, screw drivers, axes, a flashlight, then, finally... in the middle of bunch... a hunter's knife. mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to sheryl. he slides the blade between her cheek and the rope, slices. several tense moments later... the rope breaks. mike tosses the rope and gag away. they kiss.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{get me out of here. hurry.}
<A>__{mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{he'll be back soon.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{who's he?}
<A>__{off screen: a loud thud resounds. where did it come from? not wanting or waiting to find out, mike doubles the effort.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{come on, come on, come on...}
<A>__{snap! finally, the ropes tear. sheryl's free. just as...}
<B>__{all the lights simultaneously go out. complete and total}
<A>__{darkness surround the young couple. sheryl lets rip a short, but loud scream. mike quickly silences her. breathing intensifies. mike and sheryl take refuge in each other's arms. then... mike remembers... on the tool bench... the flashlight. he feels around for the bench, when... whack.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{he banged his injured leg on something.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{mike reaches the tool bench, feels around. finds it.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{mike? mike?}
<A>__{mike turns on the flashlight. the beam cuts through the darkness and onto... the concealed figure, stands face to face with mike brandishing his axe sickle. sheryl screams! the concealed figure swings the axe sickle, slices mike across the forearm. blood sprays across the floor. mike yelps in pain, drops the flashlight and knife.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl, run!}
<A>__{but sheryl freezes. he comes at mike again, but... he eludes the attack. mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach, and swings, striking the concealed figure in the knee, he drops to the ground. the concealed figure grabs mike by the throat, runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall! sheryl's frozen in fear. he squeezes his throat harder, tighter. mike can't breathe. mike smacks the concealed figure in the face, squirms, all to no avail, until... mike jams his thumb into his eye. he screams, drops mike. they both fall to the floor. the fallen flashlight's beam illuminates sheryl backed in the corner.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to sheryl)}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here! now!}
<A>__{finally sheryl runs out of the room...}
