<A>__{bud comes out the door, in slippered feet, pants and raincoat over his pajamas. as he sleep walks down the steps, a cab pulls up in front of the house. bud ducks discreetly into the areaway. mr. dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiously from the cab. between the fingers of his hands he is carrying four long stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers. the blonde steps out, holding his hat.}

<D>__{this the place?}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(to cab driver)}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{cabbie}
<D>__{seventy cents.}
<A>__{dobisch, his hands full of stingers, turns to the blonde, indicates his pants pocket.}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{get the money, will you?}
<A>__{the blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons his overcoat, reaches into his pants pocket. as she does so, she jogs his elbow.}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{watch those stingers!}
<A>__{the blonde has taken out dobisch's money clip, with about a hundred dollars in it.}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{give him a buck.}
<A>__{the blonde peels a bill off, hands it to the cabbie, hangs on to the rest of the roll just a second too long.}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{now put it back, honey.}
<P>__{(she does)}
<D>__{atta girl.}
<A>__{the cab drives off. dobisch and the blonde start up the steps to the house.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{you sure this is a good idea?}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{can't think of a better one.}
<C>__{blonde}
<P>__{(holding door open for him)}
<D>__{i mean barging in on your mother in the middle of the night?}
<C>__{dobisch}
<P>__{(edging past her with stingers)}
<D>__{don't worry about the old lady. one squawk from her, and she's out of a job.}
<A>__{in the areaway, bud has overheard them, and it doesn't make him any happier. he steps out on the sidewalk, shuffles down the street.}
