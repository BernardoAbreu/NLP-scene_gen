<A>__{raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change. he looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight. and suddenly the ninja are on him. raizo blocks and parries. counterattacks with a reverse cut and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him. the truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death. raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the scarred ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder.}
