<L>__{1 title sequence}
<A>__{in darkness, a blood curdling cacophony: the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls. above this din one particular victim yells for mercy a mixture of tears and roars of rage. by degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh this time reduced to naked scream. and with the sound, an image. a house: number 55, lodovico street, an old, three storey, late victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden. its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window. the titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway. we move inside, to the hallway. the cries are louder now. room by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run. it has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust sheets. on the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster sainterior in the kitchen, evidence of life here. opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass. we move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing. the din is furious now. on the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor. we move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar. the light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway. as we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly. we can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence. as we move through the door, the titles end.}
<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{the bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently, disorienting us. there are chains dozens of them disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth. some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. the bell tolls on. on the blood spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate chinese puzzle box. later, we'll learn its name and function. it's called the lament configuration, and it's a way to raise hell. literally. for now, it remains an enigma. a hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. in close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers. it is open at present, its polished innards exposed. out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism. the hands, which belong to one of the demons a cenobite move over the box.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<P>__{(unseen)}
<D>__{it's over ...}
<A>__{delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box, sliding the well oiled parts back into place, the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre. the room is getting darker. the chains are disappearing into the gloom. we see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness. we catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments. then they're gone. the box is almost returned to its unopened condition. the last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. it tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. the light stops swinging. the panel clicks. the tune stops. at last, a long shot of the room. at the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers. there is dust settling through the air. otherwise it is empty. the bell fades. it's as if nothing ever happened here. except ... somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{the wind is blaring as we watch the door of number}
<L>__{55. from the doorstep, voices. one is that of}
<A>__{larry cotton, the other his wife julia. clearly larry is attempting to get inside. we hear the sound of keys tried in the lock.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's one of these.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{we're going to freeze to death.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{0.k. 0.k.}
<A>__{the sound of another key tried in the lock.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{maybe somebody changed the lock.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(slightly irritated)}
<D>__{like who?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{just a thought }
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{the key is turned.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{success.}
<A>__{the door swings open.}
<D>__{voila!}
<A>__{we see the pair on the doorstep. larry is an american in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years. he looks harassed; he smirks too much. a little, but significant, corner of him is utterly defeated. julia, his wife, is english: and looks perhaps ten years his junior. she is beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness. life has disappointed her too, of late: and larry has been a major part of their disappointment.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well. this is it.}
<A>__{they step over the threshold.}
<L>__{interior upper landing day}
<A>__{the door of the torture room creaks, as the wind blows it opens an inch. from downstairs, we hear julia's voice.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it smells damp.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's just been empty a while.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{larry slams the front door.}
<L>__{interior upper landing day}
<A>__{the torture room door creaks closed again.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{besides, it's an old house.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{he stands in the hallway, not certain which way to go from here.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{how long since you were here?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the best part of ten years.}
<A>__{larry picks up some mail circulars mostly from behind the door, then leads julia through from the hallway to explore the ground floor.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old lady died, but i couldn't get frank to agree.}
<A>__{he opens one of the doors, and looks inside.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(with pleasure)}
<D>__{christ. it's not been touched.}
<A>__{he continues along the passageway. he opens another door, and steps into a large room. he opens one of the curtains. light pours in, dust laden shafts falling on the sheeted furniture.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{julia lingers in the doorway.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why didn't he want to sell it?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{i don't know. probably wanted a hideaway.}
<A>__{he pulls a sheet off a chair.}
<D>__{look at this stuff.}
<A>__{the chair is ugly; old fashioned. julia is unimpressed.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{not exactly modern.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{we'll sell it. sell everything.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i thought half of it was your brother's?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he won't complain. he can pay off some of his creditors.}
<A>__{larry is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment. he leaves the room, moving past julia to explore further.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you know we have to let kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. she'll love it.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{you mean we're moving in?}
<A>__{larry pauses. looks at her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you don't like it?}
<A>__{julia shrugs.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it's better than brooklyn.}
<A>__{she turns back down the hallway. he watches her, then follows.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you're still blaming me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no. i'm not.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you wanted to come back to london. we came back.}
<A>__{we are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so what's the argument?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{no argument.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh christ. julia ...}
<A>__{julia wanders back to the bottom of the stairs. then starts to climb.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(exasperated, to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<L>__{interior landing day}
<A>__{julia climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling. she's sick of larry; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her. what's between them is stale, like this house.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{the door opens a fraction.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{larry has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal. it smells, to judge the expression on his face. it also puzzles him. then, from above:}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{larry!}
<A>__{he leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs.}
<D>__{larry!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i hear you.}
<A>__{he starts up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{larry reaches the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(out of sight)}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{larry follows julia's voice to the end of the corridor. julia is standing in a doorway. beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{squatters?}
<A>__{larry steps past her, and throws back the blankets. wood lice scurry away. he goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it. besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric a brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries. amongst the stuff, some photographs. larry peers at them. one pictures a good looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked chinese girl.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{frank.}
<A>__{at the door, we see julia almost flinch at the name.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{he's here?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's been here. there's stuff in the kitchen. he must have made a hasty exit.}
<A>__{the 'phone rings downstairs. julia jumps.}
<D>__{that'll be kirsty.}
<A>__{larry stands up and leaves the room, moving past julia in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the bed frank has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings. as we hear larry clatter downstairs it seems julia's face is close to tears.}
<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<A>__{the 'phone continues to ring. larry steps through and picks up the receiver.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{hello ...?}
<A>__{there's no answer.}
<D>__{hello ...?}
<L>__{interior frank's 'bedroom' day}
<A>__{julia goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the photographs.}
<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(on'phone)}
<D>__{is there anybody there?}
<A>__{he puts down the 'phone. he goes back out into the hall.}
<L>__{interior frank's 'bedroom' day}
<A>__{nervous that larry will return and see what she's doing, julia is going through the photographs.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{there's nobody there }
<A>__{the sound of his foot on the stairs. hurriedly, she selects a photograph of frank without the girl, and pockets it.}
<L>__{interior stairs day}
<A>__{larry is climbing the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm surprised it's even connected ...}
<A>__{the 'phone rings again.}
<D>__{shit.}
<L>__{interior frank's bedroom day}
<A>__{mission accomplished, julia leaves the bedroom, taking one last glance at the sweat stained sheet and the indented pillar where frank lay. a lone wood louse crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds. she closes the door on the sight. downstairs, the 'phone stops ringing.}
<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<A>__{larry has picked up the 'phone.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{daddy?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior kirsty's room day}
<A>__{kirsty, the daughter of larry's first marriage, and his only child, on the 'phone. she is barely twenty, beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl next door. we can't see much of the room she's in at the moment, the shot is too tight.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{kirsty?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i got through.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i found a room.}
<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(on 'phone)}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<L>__{interior kirsty's room day}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i said: i found a room.}
<A>__{we begin to draw back from kirsty now, as she continues to speak to her father. she's sitting on a battered chair by the door. the room she's in is cramped and dirty. from outside, the sound of trains going by.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{no dad.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{you'd like the house.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you'd like my room.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{do you want me to come over?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{no, no. not just yet. it needs ... er ... some work.}
<A>__{that it does. the place, now we've got a good view of it, is a total dump.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{well i want you to see the house.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i'm not going to change my mind, dad.}
<A>__{as she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down. she succeeds. beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal. plaster falls from it.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(mouths the word)}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{well come over, will you? see the place?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{maybe tomorrow. i got to go look for a job.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{ok. honey. well you take care. i love you.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{she puts the receiver down. as she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses. she covers her face with her hand.}
<L>__{interior hallway of lodovico street day}
<A>__{julia is three steps from the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(smiles; he's pleased)}
<D>__{we'll move in sunday.}
<L>__{interior downstairs room day}
<A>__{a church bell rings. off screen, we hear voices: two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with larry masterminding the manoeuvres. we hear their efforts, but we don't yet see them. our interest is in julia, who is unpacking a tea chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{we're not going to get it in.}
<P>__{2nd man (o.s.)}
<D>__{tip it! tip it!}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{wait! wait! watch the fucking paint work.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{look, do you want the bed in or not?}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{just take it slowly.}
<P>__{1st man (o.s.)}
<D>__{oh, sod you.}
<P>__{2nd man (o.s.)}
<D>__{eh, chas, slow it down like the man says.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{it'll go in. 1st man famous last fucking words.}
<A>__{julia's face through this has been almost devoid of expression. she's holding so many feelings inside; deep inside. now she moves from one box to another, and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric a brac. she picks it up and goes through into the hallway. the bell continues to ring.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{the three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(not seeing julia)}
<D>__{alright, let's give it another try. 2nd man}
<P>__{(sees julia)}
<D>__{do you really need this bed, lady?}
<A>__{larry turns. sees julia.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{how are you doing through there?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it looks like a bomb's dropped. 2nd man got any beer?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{there's some in the 'fridge.}
<A>__{nobody moves to get it. certainly julia has no intention of being waitress. she goes to the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{larry disappears through into the kitchen. julia starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the two men in the doorway. one leans over and whispers to the other, who laughs. julia glances back at them. the whisperer licks his lips; the meaning of the gesture perfectly apparent. julia heads upstairs.}
<L>__{exterior number 55 day}
<A>__{kirsty arrives at the head of the drive. the two men are drinking beers. the bed has not been moved. she wanders down the drive towards the house.}
<L>__{exterior doorstep day}
<D>__{2nd man}
<P>__{(seeing kirsty)}
<D>__{it's my lucky day.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{hi. 2nd man want to buy a bed?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{not much.}
<A>__{she moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself between the bed and the door jamb. they watch, enjoying her efforts.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{larry emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed. his face lightens as he sees his daughter.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{honey!}
<A>__{they hug each other.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{big house.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you like?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{me like.}
<A>__{another hug.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i will show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{is julia here?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{upstairs.}
<P>__{(his voice lowers)}
<D>__{treat her gently, huh? she hates moving.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{suprise.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(a gently chiding voice)}
<D>__{kirsty.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{ok. i will be nice. you get on with the muscle work. i will make myself some coffee.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{kitchen's through on your left}
<A>__{kirsty kisses larry, and goes through to the kitchen. larry turns back to the door. the men have been watching kirsty. larry clearly dislikes the scrutiny.}
<L>__{1st man, out stared by larry, looks away. the 2nd}
<A>__{man is unperturbed.}
<D>__{2nd man that your daughter?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{uh huh. 2nd man}
<P>__{(grins oafishly)}
<D>__{got her mother's looks.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{her mother's dead.}
<L>__{2nd man's grin fades.}
<D>__{2nd man oh.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{julia's my second wife. 2nd man}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{lucky man.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{damn right. now are we going to move the bed or not?}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the kitchen is chaotic. cutlery, crockery, utensils, pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface. kirsty has found the kettle, but is having difficulty turning on the tap. she struggles with it. no joy. just a rattling sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{the pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster. the camera moves along the corridor, hugging the wall. at the end of the corridor stands julia, in a patch of sunlight. she has the photograph of frank in her hands. she looks intently at it. a close up of the photograph. then frank's voice.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<A>__{julia looks up from the photograph.}
<L>__{interior julia's flashback day}
<A>__{a front door opens. on the step of another house stands frank, with two suitcases. it's raining outside; hard. the rain has plastered his hair to his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks. he's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense. again, the line she remembers:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<A>__{the splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water, as we}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{the present day.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the tap has come on suddenly, spraying kirsty with water. she jumps back, soaked.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{shit! shit!}
<A>__{she reaches to turn the pressure down.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{the men are struggling with the bed again.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(calls through)}
<D>__{are you ok.?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(from kitchen)}
<D>__{sure.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{again, julia returns her gaze to the photograph.}
<L>__{interior julia's flashback day}
<A>__{the same scene: frank in the doorstep. now we}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the person who opened the door. it's julia; a younger julia, her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter. it is two weeks before her marriage to larry. she looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're julia, right?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{that's right. who are you?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(a dazzling smile)}
<D>__{i'm brother frank.}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i came for the wedding.}
<A>__{he looks at her, eyes glittering. his hold on her is almost mesmeric. there is going to be a wedding?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh. oh yes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well can i come in or not?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i'm sorry. of course. you're very welcome.}
<A>__{he steps inside. now he is close to her, rain running down his face. we can hear his breath; sense the almost intimidating intimacy of his presence.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's nice to know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{have you got a towel?}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{julia stares down at the photograph. off scrren, kirsty's voice:}
<C>__{kirsty }
<D>__{have you got a towel?}
<A>__{julia looks up. at the top of the stairs, kirsty soaked from the tap. julia looks up, and hurriedly pockets the photograph.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{kirsty.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{hi. i got soaked.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{there's a towel in the bath room.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{which is where?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{just to your left.}
<A>__{kirsty ducks into the bathroom. we}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{julia. it's clear the memory of her first meeting with frank has affected her deeply. the tears that threatened earlier are close.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{kirsty has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{did dad tell you i got a room, by the way? waterloo. centre of the known universe.}
<A>__{silence from outside.}
<D>__{julia?}
<P>__{(she puts her head out of the bathroom)}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{julia has gone.}
<L>__{interior upper landing day}
<A>__{the door of the torture room is pushed open. julia steps inside.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{kirsty hears the creak of footsteps on the boards above. julia's behaviour puzzles her, but she's not about to waste time thinking too hard about it. she starts downstairs again.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{we have an odd, hovering point of view of julia, as she steps inside the room. something about the atmosphere distresses her. there is a scratching sound. she looks down. a wood louse, recalling frank's foresaken bed, crawls along the edge of the skirting board. she crosses to the window, and tears away a little spy hole in the aged newspaper. from downstairs, the voices of the bed movers.}
<D>__{1st man have you got it? 2nd man i've got it. i told you }
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{wait! wait!}
<A>__{the light through the window falls on her eye. the screen becomes a white out, from which emerges:}
<L>__{interior julia's flashback day}
<A>__{a bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between the slats of bamboo blinds. outside we can hear children playing summer games. inside, a fly buzzes. julia, the younger self, is holding her wedding dress in front of her, displaying it.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i don't want to see the dress.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{but you said }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't want to see the dress.}
<A>__{julia lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her. she stares at frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know what i want.}
<A>__{still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress offers a reminder of her imminent marriage fall. she stares though, and there's an invitation in her eyes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i want you.}

<D>__{let's not talk about it.}
<C>__{prudhoe}

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{you know, you're incredible }

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{come on in. make yourself at home.}

<D>__{there's no bed.}

<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{huh?}

<D>__{right.}

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why don't you take off your jacket? you're warm.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{yeah, why don't i?}
<A>__{she slips the knot of his tie. we can hear her pulse on the soundtrack. she glances over prudhoe's shoulder. he follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek.}

<P>__{(takes over his undressing)}
<D>__{why don't you do the same?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{maybe i will.}
<A>__{prudhoe, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying not to take his eyes off julia for an instant. we watch from frank's p.o.v. as he drops his underwear. he still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton. we move back into a tighter shot.}

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{too much drink. better empty my bladder.}
<A>__{she steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{i will be a moment.}
<A>__{as he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off a hammer, which lies beside the wall. prudhoe takes hold of the door handle. turns it: it's stuck.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{the door's stuck.}
<A>__{before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head. he doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back of his shirt. to avoid the following blow he stumbles blindly towards the wall but julia's not going to be stopped now. he holds the back of his head dazed, apologetic, pitiful while she moves towards him.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{don't ... i ... please ... i'm sorry ...}
<A>__{she eclipses him.}
<D>__{... i'm so sorry ...}

<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{julia steps into the bathroom, and looks at herself in the mirror. blood is spattered on her face; her hands are similarly stained. she is trembling from head to foot. stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with cold water. then she stares up at her face again, examining it. she can scarcely believe what she's done.}
<L>__{interior lower landing day}
<A>__{she crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the torture room.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{she opens the door. as she does so frank retreats into the shadows. we are granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than before, but still horribly vulnerable. julia looks at prudhoe's corpse. a trail of blood leads away from it into the darkness. the body itself is a grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn back to expose the gums. a ghostly sight.}

<D>__{jesus christ.}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(his voice stronger)}
<D>__{do i disgust you?}
<A>__{she doesn't reply. he stretches his arm into a passage of light. his flesh glistens and pulses.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{see? it's making me whole again.}
<A>__{he turns his arm over for her appreciation.}
<D>__{every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones. and we both want that don't we?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<D>__{good. come here.}

<D>__{are you there?}
<A>__{for a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through to the back of the house.}
<L>__{interior torture room day}
<A>__{julia has wrapped the corpse of prudhoe up in its clothes and is now lifting it. the body is lighter now, having been drained of nourishment. its head lolls back and its dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly. she freezes. no sound from below. she backs out of the room with her burden. frank's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at them.}

<C>__{larry}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{she listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and stairs. then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase the signs of panic. she puts a comb through her hair, and adjusts her blouse. that done, she unbolts the door and steps out into the landing. she doesn't go down however, but up, back to the torture room.}

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<A>__{she crosses to close the door. when she turns round, he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window, his half formed face terrifying in the gloom. suddenly he reaches out and catches hold of her arm. she gasps in pain.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's what they call themselves. they're not human. maybe they were once, but they're not now. they rearrange their own flesh for pleasure.}

<C>__{julia}
<D>__{so they cheated you}
<A>__{in the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving. it's difficult to be sure what the forms signify. is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh no. they kept to their bargain. they gave me experiences i'd never forget ...}
<A>__{the images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are appalling. flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but their pleasure was my pain.}
<A>__{his voice has begun to tremble. the images in the box are more horrific by the moment. and flowing between them, highly distorted, the cenobite's faces, and that of frank, screaming and screaming.}
<C>__{frank}

<A>__{he can't speak for a moment. after a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy.}

<A>__{she steps into the corridor. the walls rise into darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and rotting away. she starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on the impacted earth of the passageway. the sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form disappearing entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness. once, she glances back towards the hospital room, to reassure herself that it's still there. it is, though it's no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway. she advances a few more paces. the atmosphere is growing denser; smoke thickens the air. then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor. the sound of the sobbing child ceases. she stops walking. ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we see a creature the engineer hanging in the space between the walls. it is in silhouette against the light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal. its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone. its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down from beneath its vast head. its tail is curled over its back. kirsty's expression registers this horror. the engineer moves into the light. its irises narrow to slits. from the tail a vast sting, oozing pus like venom, glides into view. and then it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls. its breath is a growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when all sound from it ceases, only to erupt again as it finds the light. kirsty turns, and starts to run. it comes after her at speed. darkness, light, darkness, light; roars and silence its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam. kirsty runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the safety of the hospital room. but it's very close on her heels, lingering as she comes within a few yards of the room it closes on her.}

<C>__{larry}
<D>__{of course.}

<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{julia pushes open the door of the torture room. it creaks wide. lying on the floor inthe middle of the room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing. it steams. there is blood everywhere. that too, steams. kirsty is revolted. she steps away from the door, back down the landing. the bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there is the sound of wings in the air thousands of birds beating on the other side of the wall. kirsty starts down the stairs again.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{kirsty doesn't reply. she merely hurries away.}

<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{kirsty descends the stairs. larry has stepped out of the dining room and is moving to intercept her as she makes her way to the front door. the sound of wings, and bells and a terrible slow thunder which underpins it all mounts in volume. larry snatches at her arm.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i have to get out.}
<A>__{she shrugs off his arm. the thunder is increasing.}

<D>__{no, damn you }

<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(mouths)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{everything is slowing down. the bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. larry smiles, as kirsty moves towards him. tears have begun to fill her eyes. she searches for him. his smile decays as he realizes her objective. her nails rake his cheek. the flesh puckers, and tears along the brow. blood flows. the mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and frank's twisted features come into view.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{frank!}
<A>__{kirsty screams, as frank lunges for her. the lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. kirsty avoids frank's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door. she's trapped. his torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood stained) and pulls a knife from the lining. suddenly, julia is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. frank advances on kirsty, but in the last moment before the fatal stab kirsty twists, avoiding the blow. julia shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. kirsty slips from between them. julia collapses into frank's arms. he holds her up. kirsty makes a dive for the front door, but frank lets julia slip and intercepts kirsty. julia falls back against the wall, dying. kirsty retreats to the bottom of the stairs. frank follows.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're not leaving now }
<A>__{as he follows, julia reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve. kirsty flees the only route she can, upstairs. the house is creaking in every board and rafter now. frank turns on julia, trapping her against the wall.,}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{help me, frank. for god's sake.}
<A>__{he puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her. at the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no, frank }
<A>__{from the stairs kirsty glimpses him battering upon her. then she looks away, and runs up the stairs. when we look back julia is withering in frank's arms.}
<L>__{interior lower landing night}
<A>__{the landing is smoky. the lights have taken on a yellowish tinge. the air is full of moans. kirsty is desperate for a hiding place. she tries one of the doors, but it's locked. she opens another, and the din of birds' wings gets louder.}
<L>__{interior bird room night}
<A>__{a p.o.v. shot, lunging towards kirsty in the doorway. she slams the door in the face of whatever's coming for her.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{frank hears the door slam. he drops julia to the ground. she's dead, her flesh rotting on her face. frank starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning with hunger.}

<A>__{kirsty is cornered. from below, frank's voice.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where are you, beautiful?}
<A>__{kirsty starts up the second flight of stairs, as frank's shadow is thrown up on the wall below.}
<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{kirsty is faced with a choice. the torture room door is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead she heads for the junk room, and opens the door.}
<L>__{interior junk room night}
<A>__{moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes. she crosses to the window, and tries to get it open. it won't budge.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(somewhere below)}
<D>__{where are you, honey?}
<A>__{she looks around for a lever to open the window with }
<L>__{interior lower landing night}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come to daddy.}
<L>__{interior junk room night}
<A>__{kirsty lifts a cloth off one of the boxes. staring up from the box is the corpse of prudhoe, his eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek. she reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the shadows. an arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging her back into darkness as the door opens. frank stands on the theshold. his breath is thick. he shambles forward, but he doesn't see her. we cut : back to the shadows. kirsty's eyes are wild with terror. back to the door, which clicks closed. kirsty breaks cover, and so does her saviour. it's steve. he is sweating with terror.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}

<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{the landing is empty. the door of the junk room opens. kirsty steps out. the house is strangely still. the lights swing a little; but otherwise ... nothing. she advances along the passageway. steve follows. they reach the top of the stairs in safety.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(signalled more than spoken)}
<D>__{i will go first }
<A>__{as he speaks, frank steps out of the torture room, knife in hand. roaring, he comes at them both. kirsty flings herself out of the path of the knife. frank swipes at steve, who falls backwards down the stairs. he cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. the box falls from his unconscious hand. frank turns on kirsty, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the torture room.}
<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{he's after her in a flash. she falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting its skinned face.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{god }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't cry for him. he's dead. he always was.}
<A>__{kirsty has been pushed to the limits of her endurance. she can be terrorized and pursued no longer. death looks an easy option by comparison with more of frank's horrors.}

<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{light begins to pour through the walls of the room.}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he starts towards the door. but he's too late. the cenobites are standing in his way. he backs off from them.}

<P>__{(to kirsty)}
<D>__{this isn't for your eyes.}
<A>__{kirsty crosses towards the door. as she reaches for the handle she hears frank roar behind her. she turns. he breaks between the cenobites, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. they have their hooks in him, we see. in his arms and legs; in his back and sides; in his scalp and neck and temples. hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress. they plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her. but at a gesture from the leader of the cenobites, the chains are hauled in. he flings back his head, yelling. the knife drops from his hand.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<P>__{(to kirsty)}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{she turns back to the door and opens it. frank is hauled back towards the centre of the room.}

<D>__{bitch!}
<A>__{the house is growling from basement to eaves now, as kirsty steps onto the landing.}
<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{behind her, frank howls. she looks back. they have him in extremis, his body spread eagled; hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh. he fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing. they pull the chains tighter.}
<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{a close up of frank's face. he suddenly stops fighting. he raises his head, his eyes staring up at kirsty from beneath a bleeding, sweating brow. he flicks his tongue over his bloodied lips. then he comes apart.}
<L>__{interior upper landing night}
<A>__{the door slams as frank's body is torn apart in a welter of blood and flesh fragments. something heavy thuds against the door. kirsty turns and starts down the stairs.}
<L>__{interior stairs night}
<A>__{as she reaches the place where steve is half sitting, half lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations are about to give way. steve's nose is bleeding, and his face is bruised, but he's conscious.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{we have to get out of here. they'll kill us for the fun of it.}
<A>__{steve staggers to his feet. kirsty picks up the box, which is on the lower landing. as she picks it up, the female cenobite steps from the shadows.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{don't leave us yet }
<A>__{kirsty starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{we've got such sights to show you }
<A>__{kirsty manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back into place.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{... don't ...}

<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(behind kirsty)}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{they start down to the half landing. there stands the cenobite in the dark glasses, carrying the hooked rod he threatened steve with in the hospital. again, kirsty manipulates the box. again, the cenobite howls and is claimed by the darkness.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{they hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another creature to step into their path. dust is falling from the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up in the walls. any moment, surely, the whole place will be destroyed. julia's body has gone from the hallway; a trail of blood leads into the dining room. as kirsty and steve stumble across the hallway, they hear julia's voice, off screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{kirsty ...}
<A>__{kirsty hesitates, and looks towards the door of the dining room. there stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood, her veil covering her face.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{julia?}
<A>__{kirsty takes a step towards her, but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering cenobite is beneath. kirsty slams the box closed. the cenobite howls, and disappears. steve heads for the door. turns the handle. as he does so, kirsty realizes there's one piece of the box unfinished.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{too late. he turns the handle. the door is flung open, and the engineer, clinging to the sides of the door, swings down into the hallway. steve is flung backwards against kirsty. the box falls from kirsty's hand. the beast moves to bite at steve, who scrambles out of the way, leaving kirsty in the front line. the box lies between kirsty and the engineer, which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door. she snatches for the box. the engineer, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm. again, she tries. this time one of its arms seizes hold of kirsty and drags her towards its jaws. behind kirsty, steve snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in the engineer's face. it momentarily relaxes its grip on kirsty, who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box. she now has slime on her fingers. the box defies her manipulations.}

<D>__{come on! come on!}

<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{shit. shit. shit.}
<A>__{the engineer is almost upon her. it rears up, its saliva dropping on her. and then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into place. the same vortex that seized the other cenobite seizes the engineer. howling its complaint, it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears. its voice grows thin, and fades. finally, silence. the house is still. kirsty gets to her feet. steve does the same. together, they move to the door, and out onto the step.}
<L>__{exterior doorstep night}
<A>__{the door slams behind them, of its own accord. kirsty turns the sealed box over in her hand. there is a slit in it which has not quite closed. light suddenly pours from it, up into kirsty's face. her features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards the box. from within: shrieks, bells, music. between the screams, frank's voice.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come to daddy!}
<A>__{she slams the panel shut. the distortions cease. so does the din.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(quietly)}
