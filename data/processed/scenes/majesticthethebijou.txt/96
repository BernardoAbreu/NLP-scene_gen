<L>__{interior lardner living room night}
<A>__{doc lardner is fiddling with a brand new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "your show of shows." he adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back and is successful. sid caesar and imogene coca are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and lardner fairly roars with laughter. he turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire. he returns to the spot in front of the tv, and the picture is perfect again. the doorbell rings. he's torn if he moves, the picture will break up. the doorbell rings again, and we hear adele's voice from upstairs:}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{daddy, that's luke, can you let him in? i will be right down.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{honey, i... i can't... it's the...}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{lardner}
<P>__{(giving in)}
<D>__{oh, hell...}
<A>__{he moves from his spot. the reception goes bad, and he marches to the door. he opens it, and luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out of date coat and tie.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{evening, luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{evening, doctor lardner.}
<A>__{lardner freezes, staring at luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{lardner}
<P>__{(shaken from his reverie)}
<D>__{uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, you mean the suit. harry kept all my old clothes. fits okay, but it's a little big.}
<A>__{adele comes down the stairs. halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at luke.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{awkward pause. adele's staring at luke, lardner's staring at luke, and luke's getting nervous.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i shouldn't have worn the suit.}
<A>__{adele comes down the stairs.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{... and it's just... well, deja vu.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{that's it. deja vu.}
<A>__{another awkward pause as adele and luke stare at each other. lardner breaks it.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{you kids off to the dance?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{aren't you coming?}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{no, i'm not much of a dancer.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(chidingly)}
<D>__{besides, daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{i had it, a minute ago...}
<A>__{he glances at the tv set. the picture is suddenly crystal clear.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{... ooooh, it's back.}
<P>__{(encouraging them toward the door)}
<D>__{well, you kids have fun now...}
<A>__{adele takes luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room. s l o w l y, he sneaks into the room, watching the tv carefully all the while. the reception is staying perfect. caesar and coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to. he stifles his urge, and heads for his chair. gingerly, he sits. still perfect. satisfied, he finally laughs out loud and puts his feet up. the picture goes completely haywire again.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{aw, crap.}
