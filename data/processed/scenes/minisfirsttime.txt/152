<D>__{wow, i haven't been here since you redecorated.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{it was just finished. i'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i know she'd approve.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{if you don't mind me asking, ...how are you doing?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it's been hard, but i guess i've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{you're absolutely }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{positive!?}
<A>__{mini giggles, almost embarrassed.}
<C>__{rudell}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{well, that too, but "correct" was the word i was thinking of. do you like the show?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, god, it's my favorite. i love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{i could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{a contestant? really?}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{sure, those dates are really quite harmless. you just spend an evening with the person. we prep you on what to say before the show.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it sounds like fun.}
<A>__{rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. mini, keenly aware, blushes.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{anyway, what's on your mind?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately?}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{no, is everything okay?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of martin and i together.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{together?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it indicated that we were...i know this sounds crazy, but...a couple.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{a couple? you and martin? hmmm...i mean, certainly older men and younger women are an}
<P>__{(searching again)}
<D>__{...accepted part of society, but for someone to do that, well...it's just tasteless.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{exactly, so we're just trying to figure who rit could be.}
<C>__{udell}
<D>__{hmm, i haven't noticed anyone at all...out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and martin were together?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. i mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step father.}
<C>__{rudell}
<D>__{of course.}
