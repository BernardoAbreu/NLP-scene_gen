<A>__{the man puts a finger to his lips, hushing gordy. they've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen in the distance through the trees. colombian soldiers have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection. the chiva's diesel growls loudly. when suddenly...}
<B>__{figures}
<A>__{we see figures moving in the forest between the group and the checkpointerior and then... the forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of automatic weapons fire being directed at the soldiers at the checkpointerior in the same instant, an rpg takes out a colombian army humvee in a bright, fiery explosion.}

<B>__{forest}
<A>__{we hear the sound of people crashing through the forest. they're running toward gordy and the group. the crashing gets closer. and now gordy begins to hear the breathless panting of the guerrillas in retreat. boots thud past gordy's head. when suddenly... one of the running guerrillas trips over gordy and goes sprawling. the guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and... gordy finds himself staring into the battle hardened eyes of a fierce young woman. in a heartbeat... the woman jumps back to her feet, and joins her comrades laying down a suppressing fire at the soldiers. spent cartridges rain down around gordy, as the ak 47 on full auto chops loudly over his head. and then...}

<B>__{foliage}
<A>__{bullets shred the foliage around gordy, whipping past his head... he and others keep running. a man goes down when a bullet bites into his leg. gordy slows, but the man in yankees cap won't let him stop to help. slams him hard on his back. keeps pushing gordy forward. a few moments later, we hear m 16's on full auto back where they left the man.}
