<A>__{the light switch is on. the four lights above the center of the room illuminate a classroom area desks set up in neat rows with stools, a blackboard. the other furniture has been piled high against the walls on either side of the room where the light does not reach.}

<D>__{if you'll all be seated we can begin.}
<A>__{the africans head toward their desks. pk turns to morrie.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{so far so good.}
<A>__{morrie's response is to throw the new deadbolt into its slot with a skeptical eye. pk takes his place at the head of the class.}
<C>__{pk}

<D>__{gideon?}
<C>__{mandoma}
<D>__{miss marais. will she not be coming?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<A>__{this causes a flurry among the women. pk writes on the blackboard the word "see."}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{see.}
<A>__{he says the word in zulu.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i see. you see. we see.}

<A>__{there is a knock on the door. everyone freezes.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{p.k., it's me.}
<A>__{morrie pulls the bolt, opening and shutting the door quickly. pk and maria look at each other.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i wanted to say goodbye to my students...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... and to you.}
<A>__{the four women in the class speak in unison.}
<C>__{women}
<D>__{we see the girl.}
<A>__{maria smiles, surprised. the moment is shortlived as a sound from behind the pews in the rear of the room turns everyone. in the shadows, risen from behind the piles of furniture against the two opposite walls, stand 20 policemen with long menacing riot sticks. bretyn steps into the light. mandoma gives a command and the africans form a phalanx around the women.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{once warned. twice punished.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you're violating the sanctity of the church.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{no. you are with your damned race mixing ideas, rooinek.}
<B>__{angle on morrie}
<A>__{by the door, slowly slipping the bolt lock, trying to remain innocuous while doing so. pk sees him and trades a look with mandoma, who also sees what morrie is doing.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{at least let the women go.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{you want everything to be equal, little boetie. why not men and women too?}
<A>__{just then morrie throws the bolt.}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{he goes to charge out the door, but to his chagrin the door does not open, locked from the outside. bretyn smiles cruelly.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{locks keep people out but they also keep them in.}
<A>__{he has walked right up to morrie, not taking his eyes off morrie's for a moment. morrie meets his gaze evenly. the moment is broken as bretyn's baton slams into morrie's stomach, dropping him to this knees.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{get up, you bloody commie jew!}
<A>__{he bangs morrie hard in the jaw, knocking him out cold.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{captain.}
<A>__{the two police lines start to move towards each other, sandwiching the africans, pk and maria. mandoma gives an order. the blacks pick up anything they can to face the inevitable stools, chairs, a flagpole.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no. wait. we'll leave.}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{too late. you never should have come. at the ready.}
<A>__{the two police lines tense to charge forward. the blacks brace to defend.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no! stop!}
<C>__{bretyn}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{the police charge from both ends of the room, yelling, clubs held high. the africans respond with their own war cry and engage the club swinging police. a policeman swings at pk who ducks and buries a hook into the man's ribs followed by another to his jaw. the man goes down. pk's pov morrie has risen to take a policeman out with a stool over his head. two other police beat morrie from behind. he goes down once again under their brutal clubs.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{pk turns just as another club comes for his head. he slips past the blow and punches out his assailant with a lightning combination. as the man falls another cop charges from behind.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{pk!}
<A>__{pk turns off balance. maria leaps. the club cuts through the air. maria is caught flush on the forehead as she comes between pk and the club. she falls to the floor dead. pk swings a stool with all his might, breaking the cop's face open.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{maria!}
<A>__{pk drops to the fallen girl's side. he is frantic at the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of her open blank eyes. the battle raging around him recedes before his pain and rising rage. all at once he explodes, screaming like a madman. he leaps at bretyn and bangs one punch after another into the startled man. bretyn's face is broken over and over against pk's fists. still pk keeps pounding blow after blow into the fallen man. three cops descend on pk and beat him mercilessly until he drops to the floor, unconscious. mandoma is hit hard and goes down. the few africans left fighting go down before the withering assault of clubs, fists, and boots.}
