<L>__{exterior a gas station (day)}
<A>__{we see mary's car drive in, come to a stop. there are no other cars about, this being a gas station off the main highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen. no one comes and for a moment mary considers driving on, as if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that she should listen to. but the gas registers almost empty. she has to blow her horn. a young man comes out of the shack, starts toward her car. at that moment, we hear the ringing of the telephone in the shack. the attendant walks a few steps further, toward mary's car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. the phone's insistent ringing unnerves mary. she starts her car, zooms off. we see the attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. he looks after the departing car with little or no expression.}
<B>__{car}
<A>__{the car grows smaller as it races up the road. the sun is setting. there is something vaguely ominous about the darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.}
