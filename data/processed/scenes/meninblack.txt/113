<L>__{interior morgue corridor day}
<A>__{on a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand bangs on a bell on a countertop, over and over. the hand belongs to edgar, who is carrying his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. the morgue attendant, tony, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of atlas shrugged and a fly swatter.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{thank you for making sure the bell works.}
<A>__{suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, tony snaps the fly swatter down on a buzzing fly. edgar winces.}
<C>__{tony }
<P>__{(to edgar)}
<D>__{what's up, farmer john?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{a man came in here earlier. a dead man.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and this means what to me?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{he was a very dear friend of mine. and i believe he had an animal with him. a gift i gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. i would like it back.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i will need a picture id, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with }
<A>__{whack! tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. edgar grits his teeth.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{ the deceased.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<A>__{whack! still another fly goes down.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{tony looks down, to where edgar's hands rest on the counter. half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he ducks under the counter and comes up with a can of raid. edgar's eyes bug out.}
