<A>__{all about eve}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior dining hall sarah siddons society night}
<A>__{it is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight. a long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. diner is over. demi tasses, cigars and brandy. the overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. it is june. the camera, as it has been throughout the credit titles, is on the sarah siddons award. it is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of sarah siddons as the tragic muse. exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor. over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise voice of addison dewitt:}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement is perhaps unknown to you. it has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable "honors" as the pulitzer prize and those awards presented annually by the film society...}
<A>__{the camera has eased back to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow white hair who is speaking. we do not hear what he says.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor. being an actor he will go on speaking for some time. it is not important what you hear what he says.}
<A>__{the camera eases back some more, and continues until it discloses a fairly comprehensive shot of the room}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{however it is important that you know where you are, and why you are here. this is the dining room of the sarah siddons society. the occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our theater knows the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement.}
<A>__{a group of waiters are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen. the screens are papered with old theatrical programs. the waiters are all aged and venerable. they look respectfully toward the speaker.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{these hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon modjeska, ada rehan and minnie fiske; mansfield's voice filled the room, booth breathed this air. it is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death.}
<A>__{close the award on its altar, it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented. minor awards are for such as the writer and director since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than eve harrington. eve... but more of eve, later. all about eve, in fact.}
<A>__{the camera moves to: close addison dewitt, not young, not unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and merciless of tongue. an omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of d'artagnan. he sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. his narration covers the move of the camera to him:}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{to those of you who do not read, attend the theater, listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of the world in which we live it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself. my name is addison dewitt. my native habitat is the theater in it i toil not, neither do i spin. i am a critic and commentator. i am essential to the theater as ants are to a picnic, as the ball weevil to a cotton field...}
<A>__{he looks to his left. karen richards is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way. she is scraping bread crumbs, spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. addison takes one of her bread crumbs. she smiles absently. addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{this is karen richards. she is the wife of a playwright, therefore of the theater by marriage. nothing in her background or breeding should have brought her any closer the stage than row e, center...}
<A>__{karen continues her doodling.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{... however, during her senior year in radcliffe, lloyd richards lectured on drama. the following year karen became mrs. lloyd richards. lloyd is the author of 'footsteps on the ceiling' the play which has won for eve harrington the sarah siddons award...}
<A>__{karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. a hand reaches in to take the spoon away. karen looks as the camera pans with it to max fabian. he sits at her left. he's a sad faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension. he smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps. he pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping. karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. addison mashes a cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. he eyes max.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{there are two types of theatrical producers. one has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss. this type is interested in art.}
<A>__{max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps delicately and close his eyes.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the other is one to whom each production mean potential ruin or fortune. this type is out to make a buck. meet max fabian. he is the producer of the play which has won eve harrington the sarah siddons award...}
<A>__{max rests fitfully. he twitches. a hand reaches into the scene, removes a bottle of scotch from before him. the camera follows the bottle to margo channing. she sits at max's left, at dewitt's right. an attractive, strong face. she is childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable usually one when she should be the other, but always positive. she pours a stiff drink. addison hold out the soda bottle to her. she looks at it, and at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. he smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{margo channing is the star of the theater. she made her first stage appearance, at the age of four, in 'midsummer night's dream'. she played a fairy and entered quite unexpectedly stark naked. she has been a star ever since.}
<A>__{margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{margo is a great star. a true star. she never was or will be anything less or anything less...}
<P>__{(slight pause)}
<D>__{... the part for which eve harrington is receiving the sarah siddons award was intended originally for margo channing...}
<A>__{addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor. as he speaks the camera moves in the direction of his glance...}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the sarah siddons society, but also the history of acting since thespis first stepped out of the chorus line our distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here...}
<A>__{at this point addison's voice fades out and the voice of the aged actor fades in. camera is in medium close shot of him and the podium.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{i have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the theater "a poor player ... that struts and frets his hour upon the stage" and i have been honored to be, for forty years, chief promoter of the sarah siddons society...}
<P>__{(he lifts the sarah}
<D>__{siddons award from its}
<P>__{altar)}
<D>__{thirty nine times have i placed in deserving hands this highest honor the theater knows...}
<P>__{(he grows a bit arch, he uses his eyebrows)}
<D>__{surely no actor is older than i i have earned my place out of the sun...}
<P>__{(indulgent laughter)}
<D>__{... and never before has this award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight. how fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers...}
<A>__{eve hands: lovely, beautifully groomed. in serene repose, they rest between a demi tasse cup and an exquisite small evening cup.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{such young hands. such a young lady. young in years, but whose heart is as old as the theater...}
<A>__{addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. then, slowly, he turns to look at karen...}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{some of us a privileged to know her. we have seen beyond the beauty and artistry }
<A>__{karen never ceases her thoughtful pat a cake with the crumbs.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{ that have made her name resound through the nation. we know her humility. her devotion, her loyalty to her art.}
<A>__{addison's glance moves from karen to margo.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{her love, her deep and abiding love for us }
<A>__{margo's face is a mask. she looks down at the drink which she cradles with both hands.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{ for what we are and what we do. the theater. she has had one wish, one prayer, one dream. to belong to us.}
<P>__{(he's nearing his curtain line)}
<D>__{tonight her dream has come true. and henceforth we shall dream the same of her.}
<P>__{(a slight pause)}
<D>__{honored members, ladies and gentlemen for distinguished achievement in the theater the sarah siddons award to miss eve harrington.}
<A>__{the entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause. some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet... flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the aged actor's left... eve rises beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned. she stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. a dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water bugs. flash bulbs pop and pop and pop... the waiters applaud enthusiastically... aged actor, award in hand, he beams at her... eve smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right... max has come to. he applauds lustily. addison's applauding too, more discreetly. margo, not applauding. but you sense no deliberate slight, merely an impression that as she looks at eve her mind is on something else... karen, nor is she applauding. but her gaze is similarly fixed on eve in a strange, faraway fashion. addison, still applauding, his eyes flash first at margo and then at karen. then he directs them back to eve. he smiles ever so slightly. the applause has continued unabated. eve turns now, and moves gracefully toward the aged actor. she moves through applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs keep popping... as she nears her goal, the ages actor turns to her. he holds out the award. her hand reaches out for it. at that precise moment with the award just beyond her fingertips the picture holds, the action stops. the sound stops.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{eve. eve, the golden girl. the cover girl, the girl next door, the girl on the moon... time has been good to eve, life goes where she goes she's been profiled, covered, revealed, reported, what she eats and when and where, whom she knows and where she was and when and where she's going...}
<A>__{addison has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring intently at eve... his narration continues unbroken.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{... eve. you all know all about eve... what can there be to know that you don't know...?}
<A>__{as he leans back, the applause fades in as tumultuous as before. addison's look moves slowly from eve to karen. karen, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on eve. her lovely face fills the screen as the applause fades once more as she thinks back:}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{when was it? how long? it seems a lifetime ago. lloyd always said that in the theater a lifetime was a season, and a season a lifetime. it's june now. that was early october... only last october. it was a drizzly night, i remember i asked the taxi to wait...}
