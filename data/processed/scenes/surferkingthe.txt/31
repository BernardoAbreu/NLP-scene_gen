<L>__{ext moments later the wave area}
<A>__{robbie and alex have their swimsuits on, and are in line to get on the wave. alex is coaching robbie.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. when you wipe out, your ride is done.}
<A>__{alex is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. he is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the wave bums. he does a few tricks and wipes out. he gets up and walks up to the line to watch robbie.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{just ease into it.}
<A>__{robbie takes the board and looks around. he jumps full force onto the wave. it takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the wave bums look like rookies. spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does. finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up.}

<P>__{(meeting him at the exit)}
<D>__{gees. where did you learn to do that?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm from oceanside, california. i was born on a surfboard.}
<A>__{they start walking back. they stop for a moment to look at thunder bay. just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{think you could ride that?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(looking right into alex's eyes)}
<D>__{in my sleep.}
<A>__{alex just smiles.}
