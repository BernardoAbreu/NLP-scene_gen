<L>__{interior midnite's office}
<A>__{sweep across a meticulously crafted orrery, a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion. but the planets here are ancient relics with symbols and names material, astral, spiritual, iconic, etc. and the globe at the center "creator." this is an orrery of the forces of the universe. and it's not moving.}
<C>__{midnite }
<D>__{et separatur a plasmate tuo, ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes...}
<A>__{john steps in through the doors behind.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{deciding which color to paint this place again?}
<A>__{pappa midnite stands in the jungle he calls an office. part african witch doctor, part savvy businessman. a full six and half feet of solid contradictions.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{you're back early.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i got tired of spending your money.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{but i'm sure you spent enough.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well i do have a certain standard of living.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{tell me you found it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i found the vault.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{that's not what i asked.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, can i help it if buddhist monks don't take bribes?}
<A>__{midnite strides toward him when john calmly pulls from his pocket a small ebony and gold relic. it stops midnite cold.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<A>__{a reluctant grin cracks midnite's stern features. he takes the relic in his thick fingers stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{right. so we good here?}
<A>__{midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the universal orrery.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{it should counter the iconic plane }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that damn thing's never going to balance.}
<A>__{midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts to move. to turn. john is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt. midnite deflates, stares at john, suspiciously.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{must i remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's authentic, midnite, you just have the wrong piece. jesus...}
<A>__{the two have a mini stare down. john's rigid poker face is only broken by a cough. midnite sighs, breaks it off.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what? i didn't blink that was a cough. you never cough?}
<A>__{midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a thick stack of hundreds.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{better not be any washingtons in here this time.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{why did you cut your trip short?}
<A>__{john stops the counting, actually thinks about it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know... just a feeling }
<A>__{john suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned to see }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{balthazar.}
<A>__{balthazar is behind him. utterly confident. chillingly so.}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{we're not still whining about manhattan, are we?}
<A>__{john's attempt to disguise his anger fails.}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{that expression alone has made my entire night.}
<A>__{john takes several steps toward him. grins. malevolent. there's history here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will make your night i will deport your sorry ass right where you stand }
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{john.}
<A>__{john stops in his tracks.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's bad enough that you let these half breeds in at all but this piece of shit }
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{perks of becoming a primary investor.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{midnite's eyes say it all not here, not now.}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{things change, balances shift. get used to it, constantine.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not while i'm still breathing }
<A>__{john starts to cough again.}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't catch that.}
<A>__{john tries to catch his breath, can't. and that scares him a bit. he tries to hide it, pushes out.}
