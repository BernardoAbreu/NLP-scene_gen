<L>__{interior mall o'charley's day}
<A>__{ronnie walks up to o'charley's. it's the one step up restaurant that's in the mall. there's a bouncer out front who watches over the store.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you working the door here?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{that's what they tell me. they needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. ha. you do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{i work for o'charley's, not for the mall.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of carolina mall?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{you know, i thought about getting a job as a mall security.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{yeah, man. i mean, i'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, i don't want to do shit, you know what i mean? my parents said i have to work if i want to live at home, but i just don't feel like doing anything. this was the easiest job i could find, i mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? but now that i think about it, mall security could be easier than this.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{my young friend, you are sorely mistaken. do you know how much stuff i'm in charge of?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{a shitload. that's not even counting the parking lot.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{really? i thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. there's so much other stuff.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{two words, friday night.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's crazy, let's just leave it at that.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{listen. i like you, but i don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. if you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps i could look into getting you a job on my staff?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. it's who i am.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{does it pay more than $6.50 an hour?}
<A>__{ronnie laughs. he leans over to the bouncer and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{seven even.}
<A>__{ronnie stands back and winks at the bouncer.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{i'd say that's more than i'm making now.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hold on, this job involves a probationary period. you have to prove yourself worthy. we can't just hire any old tom, dick, or harry just because they want to carry a flashlight.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what do i have to do?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you have to complete a term as deputy. you will answer directly to me. your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. if this works out, then i will phone the crime into the police. now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{so basically, i just do what i'm doing now and then you'll get me a job?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{for starters.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{how long does this mentorship last?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{until mark lets me hire another guy.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{can i smoke while i work?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes, you can.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{sign me up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you keep that attitude up and you'll have no problem making the squad.}
<A>__{ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the bouncer a mini flashlight.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's a flashlight. get to know it. it's your new best friend. until you get your giant flashlight. then, that will be your new best friend.}
<A>__{the bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, look alive, soldier. deputy time starts now. no more slacker attitude for you.}
<A>__{ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know, i remember when i got my first flashlight...}
<A>__{ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind. ronnie walks away leaving the bouncer there alone.}
