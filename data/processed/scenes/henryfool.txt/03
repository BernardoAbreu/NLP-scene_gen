<L>__{interior the grim house day}
<A>__{moments later. simon runs up and throws open the screen door. he stands there in the doorway catching his breath. his sister, fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small portable tv while their mother, mary, sits a few feet away in the living room watching another tv tuned to a different channel.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<P>__{(to mary)}
<D>__{mom, come on and eat.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm not hungry.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{then why'd i cook!}
<A>__{mary is a manic depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in the evening.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i don't know why you cooked! i don't know why you bother!}
<A>__{fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. she glares at her brother.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{sit down and eat, simon.}
<A>__{simon sits at the table and fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel. he hesitates, then lifts his spoon. supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more. pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it. he suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table. the container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out. he stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while... fay and mary look on in disgust.}
