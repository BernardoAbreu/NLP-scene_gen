<A>__{mules are loaded up with burlap bags containing 3,000 kilos of heroin.}
<L>__{exterior opium farm jungle day}
<A>__{the mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the opium farm. nate's thai thugs, left behind in sniper positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they have to as frank, nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.}
<L>__{exterior jungle later day}
<A>__{they seem to have made it, winding back down through the jungle with the mules. suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts from the trees a couple of nate's men are hit as the rest dive for cover, shouting "vietcong," and returning the fire. frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots into the trees. bullet severed palm fronds rain down.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{give them half!}
<A>__{nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the noise.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{cut half of them loose! the mules!}
<A>__{nate cuts the mule train tether in the middle, slaps at the animals. as the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. smoke from all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen thais and americans lying dead on the ground.}
