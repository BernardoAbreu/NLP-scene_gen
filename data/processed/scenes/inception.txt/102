<A>__{cobb head butts the second businessman, pushes past him the first businessman races out of the bar, sees cobb's wake, dives after him cobb races headlong through tight passageways, weaving through or knocking into the locals... he steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables... the first businessman enters, spots him. an african man gets in cobb's face, jabbering at him in swahili cobb considers his options... the first businessman draws a gun cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window, scrambling into the alley outside... cobb looks left, right... cuts left into a narrow, crowded alley the alley narrows to a dead end. faces in the crowd start to watch cobb people start to surround him cobb looks back the way he came the two businessmen are there, guns drawn cobb sees a small gap between the buildings at the narrow end he throws himself into it gets stuck halfway... the crowd bears down, grabbing for him as cobb struggles to squeeze himself through the gap... cobb's moving inches as his pursuers gain yards... the crowd is upon him... he bursts free. tumbling onto the next street, rolling out of sight. cobb jumps to his feet in a market square. two more businessmen move towards him. cobb bolts but a car skids up, blocks his path the door opens saito is in the back.}
