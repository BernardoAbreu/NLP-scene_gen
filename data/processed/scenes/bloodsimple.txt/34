<A>__{abby has just gotten out of her car and is walking up to the front of the darkened bar. the faint, rhythmic thumping continues over the cut, its source somewhere offscreen. as abby takes a key out of her purse and lets herself into the bar, the thumping stops.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{marty?}
<A>__{the door swings open, fanning a shaft of light onto the darkened room. marty's office bathroom we are looking from the inside at the bathroom door that won't close all the way. as the light fans into the office beyond and seeps in through the crack of the bathroom door, we see visser's sleeve cuff and his hand pressing against the door, to hold it near shut.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{standing in the office doorway. we pull her into the room. she stops abruptly, looking past the camera, and wrinkles her nose. abby's pov marty's fish, now half decayed, still lie on the desk. some of the desk drawers stand open, with some of their contents strewn across the surface of the desk.}

<A>__{she takes a step forward. we hear the crunch of glass underfoot. she looks down at the floor. abby's pov shards of broken glass lie on the floor.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{she looks up from the floor toward the back door. abby's pov the pane of the back door window closest to the knob has been shattered from the outside, scattering broken glass into the office.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{she crosses slowly to the desk, staring at the rotted fish. she looks up from the desk. abby's pov on the standing safe behind the desk lies a white towel. abby's hand enters frame ans picks up the towel. in slow motion a hammer that's been wrapped inside slips out of the towel, falls end over end, hits the floor with a dull thud.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{stooping down to pick up the hammer. at eye level as she stoops down is the combination dial to the safe. the dial has been battered by the hammer. abby looks from the hammer to the floor under the desk chair. abby's pov blood stains.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{staring down at the floor. she rises and looks at the desk. as she rises we hear glass under her feet. abby's pov the dead fish. beyond them, on the floor around the desk, broken glass.}

<A>__{staring. abby's pov the dead fish.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{she seems to be falling slowly backwards. the camera falls with her, keeping her in close shot. her head hits a pillow. we pull back slowly to reveal that she is lying on the bed in her apartment, staring across the room. she lies motionless on the bad, her eyes wide. abby's pov across the darkened apartment we see the curtainless windows, and beyond them, across the lamplit street, the facade of the opposite building.}
<B>__{long shot abby}
<A>__{lying still. after a moment she gets out of bed, crosses to the front door of the apartment, locks it, then walks unsteadily back to the bed.}
