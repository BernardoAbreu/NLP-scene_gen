<L>__{exterior city park day (minutes later)}
<A>__{catch is walking bob in the park, but is also checking for someone, studying the playground. he begins walking toward the swings. angle sandbox tommy, catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a metal truck. catch walks up to tommy, carrying a bulging plastic bag but tommy's attention is on bob, and pets the big, friendly dog. angle candace she sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit. on catch, tommy catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills out the contents of the bag action figures, superheroes, soldiers. tommy goes wide eyed at the array. catch is pleased by the boy's reaction. catch keeps a layer of emotion covered here.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you like these?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{well... they're for you. we can pretend it's your birthday.}
<A>__{tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight. candace is walking toward them, and catch turns to her.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{they're for me, mom!}
<A>__{her look of surprise questions him.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{yeah. i've... kind of been saving them up.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{for tommy?}
<A>__{he nods. she kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased but not quite knowing what to say.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{well, thank you. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{catch nods, grins at tommy who is already at play with the figures. angle sharon she has entered the park and witnessed this from a distance. she is angling toward the playground.}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{he watches tommy at play with the figures, but it's almost too much for him. he touches the boy and rises, smiles and nods at candace and begins to walk off.}
<B>__{on sharon}
<A>__{she hurries her steps to intersect with catch. on candace, tommy}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{wow, tommy look at them all. did you say thank you?}
<A>__{now tommy looks up. catch is moving away with bob, walking home. tommy stands up, candace calls out to stop catch.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{excuse me!}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{but he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. we see, in b.g., tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. we now have a convergence of tommy, sharon and catch, who is moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path now. a biker is coming on. all in one moment catch hears the whizz of the bike, tommy calling out "thank you," and candace shouting "be careful!" and catch goes cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike path, taking the collision with the bike so tommy is sure to be safe. catch and the biker fall hard. sharon stops holding her breath. tommy watches, wide eyed, and candace comes running. catch is rising, a little sore and soiled. the biker is angry.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{goddammit i saw the kid. jesus. i wasn't even close.}
<A>__{but catch is walking away with that frozen, numb look, all shut down by his fear and his memory as bob trots along beside him and the biker comes after him and tommy and candace watch him go and sharon hurries her steps to catch up. the biker reaches catch first.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{wait a minute! hey!}
<A>__{but catch won't turn to him, walking on and the man gets in front of him, raging.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{why the hell did you cause a wreck?! i told you i saw the kid, you idiot. i was...}
<A>__{pain and darkness build in catch's eyes until he says in a quiet, choked voice, right into the biker's face...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{one more word, and your life will change forever.}
<A>__{the man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in catch's eyes. he wants to say more, to save face, but catch's look holds him like a fist. sharon has stopped, frozen, watching. the biker turns away and walks back to his downed bike as catch moves on. sharon can hardly believe all of this, following catch again. on catch, sharon}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{catch! catch!}
<A>__{it takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he quickly turns and sees her approaching.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{are you all right? your elbow's bleeding. i...}
<A>__{but he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she catches up again.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{where are you going? catch you're scaring me. please...}
<A>__{but he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way, faces him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{please, catch, don't... can't you talk to me?!}
<A>__{he turns and walks off, heading for the street.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{please. wait. i... catch!}
<A>__{he has walked into traffic not completely unmindful of the cars, but desperate to get away. she watches this, frozen, as horns blare. he has to stop in the middle of the street to wait a moment, and he stands there, stricken.}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{as the traffic moves around him and the dog a horn blares, brakes screech, and he thrown into a storm of...}
<B>__{flashbacks}
<A>__{that come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces of memory outside any order: he is driving, annie smiles at him, headlights blind him, annie screams, the little boy in annie's arms grins at him, brakes scream, annie says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the headlights blind him again and brakes scream again, and: back to scene (present) catch stands there shaken and shut down.}
<B>__{on sharon}
<A>__{watching him, shocked and frightened for him. she sees the traffic let up, and catch crosses and walks toward home. she watches him go.}
