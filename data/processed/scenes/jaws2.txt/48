<L>__{interior vaughn's office day}
<A>__{small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols of amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new holiday inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{of course. look i've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{no one has seen a shark no fin, no bites, nothing. be realistic.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i got a feeling. i have to act on it you can understand that, can't you?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{of course i can, but can't it wait? these things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{we have to do something.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{we have done something hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i know, i know...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! in new england? we all lost on that one.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it's still a good idea.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{please, larry there's good reason. those water skiers...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{a tragedy. but that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{two of them are still missing!}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{there's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. are they all shark victims?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{maybe they are!}
<A>__{brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{bullshit? i will give you bullshit there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{what am i, an ass? when you called me, i called elkins, and her bosses. nothing she saw is proof of anything.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{someone has to do something.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(back in control)}
<D>__{don't push it this time. if you do, it won't turn out the way you want, i guarantee you that.}
<A>__{the two men study each other for a long moment. then,}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i've got to get back to work.}
<A>__{he holds the door for brody, who walks out as vaughn lags behind, locking up his sanctum.}
