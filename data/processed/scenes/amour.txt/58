<A>__{georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet. he is looking for a specific dress. he takes some out, puts them back inside. one of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor. he picks it up, hangs it up again. he ends up finding the one he was looking for. he takes it out on its hanger. closes the closet again. looks at the dress. then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom. he catches his feet in the dress. he just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there. exhausted, he flops down into it.}
