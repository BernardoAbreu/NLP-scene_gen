<A>__{sykes sits stunned behind the wheel. disoriented but conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees jetson out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding. then he looks over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug mobile near the gas tank.}

<A>__{sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge unconscious alien away from the cars. he's still dragging jetson away when he spots harcourt pulling himself through the smashed police unit window. bruised and bleeding, harcourt reaches in for the suitcase, then starts to run with it. with jetson a safe distance away from the cars, sykes clambers to his feet, draws the casull, and starts off after harcourt. harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the closed drawbridge. he heaves the suitcase over, then starts to climb. sykes lumbers past the burning police unit. kipling is still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward. sykes is just past the cars when they explode sending hoods and door panels and glass flying in all directions. harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the abandoned drawbridge. sykes reaches the fence. instead of climbing, he simply blows the lock to hell with the casull, and kicks open the gate.}
