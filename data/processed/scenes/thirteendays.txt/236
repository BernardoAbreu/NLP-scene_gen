<L>__{interior cabinet room continuous}
<A>__{the news hits the room like a thunderbolt. kenny looks to bobby and the president. the blood is gone from their faces.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{then we're out of time. we have to go in.}
<C>__{lundahl}

<C>__{the president}
<D>__{permission granted.}
<A>__{taylor exits. kenny rises, gives the president an almost imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in taylor's wake.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time...}
