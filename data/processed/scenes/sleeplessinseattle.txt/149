<L>__{exterior street near marina day}
<A>__{annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out. sam's van pulls into a parking space. jonah in the front with sam. they're diagonally across a four lane street.}
<B>__{on sam and jonah}
<A>__{as they start to get groceries out of the car. annie watching. this is it. no chickening out this time. she's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole thing. it's now or never. sam and jonah start toward the gate to the dock. annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and rightness with every step. but she stops dead when she sees:}
<B>__{suzy}
<A>__{who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at the gate to the marina waving, smiling a mile wide beckoning sam and jonah home like a military wife whose boys have just come back from the front. sam and jonah are overjoyed to see her. jonah breaks into a run, nearly leaping into suzy's waiting arms as sam brings up the rear, picking up jonah's sodas which he dropped when he started running.}
<B>__{on annie}
<A>__{she comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street. in shock. the scene in front of her is too horrible to bear. annie's pov gate to marina sam catches up. suzy no less beautiful and vivacious than she was before tousles jonah's hair, kisses sam and hugs them both. on sam, jonah and suzy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{god, it's wonderful to see you. where's greg?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{he's over at the boat show. he'll be by later.}
<P>__{(she looks around)}
<D>__{it's so beautiful here.}
<B>__{annie}
<A>__{there is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about this homecoming that she forget where she is in the middle of the street. a car horn blares at her... all she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded. she starts to back away and that's when she sees }
<B>__{a taxicab}
<A>__{coming right at her, horn blaring, tires squealing. annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van bearing down from the opposite direction. she steps back to the middle line. the cab goes into a skid. annie freezes. sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on. the cab comes screeching right at the camera. annie screams. the cab stops inches from her body. the van in the other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.}
<B>__{on sam}
<A>__{responding. he runs from the gate toward the near accident.}
<B>__{on the cab driver}
<A>__{getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the sidewalk.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{lady, what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, hears the cabbie but doesn't respond. stunned, she turns to see sam on the other side of the street. their eyes meet. sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw in the airport.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything that's happened, bolts for her car. sam wants to run after her but there's traffic is coming past and he can't cross the street. annie gets into her car, starts and pulls away. sam stands there, deflated.}
