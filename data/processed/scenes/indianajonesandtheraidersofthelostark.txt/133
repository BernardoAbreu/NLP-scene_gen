<L>__{interior train tunnel}
<A>__{the ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns. the tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide. it's height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where support beams cross the track. the result is that there is only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the head. shliemann, looking worried, and belloq, very excited, are focused on the ark in the car ahead.}

<D>__{let me ask you this would you be more comfortable opening the ark in berlin for the fuhrer and finding out only then if the sacred pieces of the covenant are inside? knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission and obtained the one, true ark?}
<A>__{shliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives. he looks at belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright light.}
