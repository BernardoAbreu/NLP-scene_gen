<L>__{exterior pappas' house night}
<A>__{early evening. utah pulls into the driveway. when he kills the engine we hear greek music from inside the house. at the entrance johnny finds the door ajar. he pushes it open a little to reveal }
<L>__{interior house}
<A>__{pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt off, holding a glass of ouzo. facing away from the door the ample greek hears utah's tentative knock. without breaking from his dance or turning he calls out }
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{hey, babe. get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark.}
<A>__{pappas howls like a bloodhound, then twirls around.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{woof, woof.}
<A>__{we see the startled pappas, at a loss for the first time.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{johnny! uh, you, uh... should call first, you know? hey, where the hell were you all day? you gotta at least call in or something. you okay?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{angelo, we gotta talk.}
<A>__{pappas moves toward him, kind of subconsciously herding utah back out the door.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{listen, uh... if you're okay, can it wait till tomorrow morning, kid, i...}
<A>__{johnny hears footsteps and turns. miss deer comes through the door like it's not the first time, carrying a bag of groceries.}
<C>__{miss deer}
<D>__{angie, they didn't have the kind of wine you like but i got... oh, hi johnny!}
<A>__{her icy office persona obviously got left there. her hair is unbound and flows around her shoulders, and in halter top and jeans she looks delectably off duty. angelo looks at utah like don't you say a fucking word.}
