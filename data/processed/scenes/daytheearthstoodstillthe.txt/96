<L>__{int upstairs hallway}
<A>__{helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed. she's putting it on as she moves down the hall to bobby's room, the door of which is open.}
<L>__{interior bobby's room}
<A>__{bobby is at a table doing his homework and klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as helen enters, still putting on her coat.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(about to leave)}
<D>__{all you have to remember is, first find the common denominator then subtract.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{thanks, mr. carpenter.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(to helen, pleasantly)}
<D>__{i will say goodnight again.}
<A>__{helen is embarrassed. she would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go about it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mr. carpenter, i }
<P>__{(it's too complicated; she can't do it)}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a warm smile of}
<D>__{complete understanding}
<P>__{and appreciation)}
<D>__{goodnight, my dear.}
<A>__{he turns and goes out, closing the door. a little distracted, helen turns to bobby.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{go to bed, darling. you can finish that in the morning.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{helen watches as he starts to put away his work. she wants to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(hesitantly, almost guiltily)}
<D>__{bobby i think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of mr. carpenter}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(shocked, and bewildered)}
<D>__{gee, why, mom? he's my best friend... and he's awful good in arithmetic. he even helps professor barnhardt.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{did you and mr. carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sure we did! he wasn't there but we went to see him. and mr. carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.}
<A>__{helen is surprised to get this corroboration for klaatu's story. sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for something intriguing some deep, dark secret.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(shrewdly)}
<D>__{mom is there something wrong with mr. carpenter?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what do you mean, dear?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i mean on account of that policeman last night.}
<P>__{(his eyes light up hopefully)}
<D>__{you think he's a bank robber, maybe? or a gangster?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no, dear, of course not. he's a very nice man. i just think he might prefer to be left alone. now you get to bed and forget about it.}
<P>__{(she kisses him)}
<D>__{'night, darling.}
<A>__{with a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<P>__{(stopping her in the}
<D>__{doorway, his imaginative suspicions}
<P>__{mounting)}
<D>__{hey mom why would he want to be alone?}
<A>__{not wanting to go into this any further, helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door. bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities. still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. he drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door. the door opens and klaatu appears.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{bobby have you a flashlight?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(surprised by his}
<D>__{appearance and his}
<P>__{request)}
<D>__{yeah sure.}
<P>__{(he goes to a drawer}
<D>__{and gets a large}
<P>__{hand flashlight)}
<D>__{it's a real boy scout flashlight.}
<A>__{bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager curiosity.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what do you want it for, mr. carpenter?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(evasively)}
<D>__{why the light in my room went out.}
<P>__{(cutting off further questions)}
<D>__{thank you, bobby. goodnight.}
<A>__{klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. bobby hesitates a moment, puzzled and curious. then he goes over to the door, flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{shooting down the hall through the crack in bobby's door. klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly. klaatu goes to his door, reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door. he then scans the hall in both directions. satisfied he isn't seen, he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, still carrying the flashlight. med close shot bobby as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense excitement on his face. what he has seem is certainly, unmistakably suspicious. why did mr. carpenter lie to him? what does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? bobby decides he's got to find out. hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find the hall clear. he slips out the door, closing it behind him.}
