<A>__{miles pulls up in an old cadillac, picking up jake at the entrance. they pick up gordo and big al from a side door and drive off as moonan limps out of the restaurant, still holding his crotch.}

<L>__{interior the euclid day (resuming)}
<A>__{jake finishes the story to lupus.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and that's how special agent gunther moonan and i became friends.}
<A>__{lupus nods, satisfied.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{moonan. here. shit...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{so what? we just stay clear of him.}
<A>__{jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{jesus... take it easy.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, i'm not going to take it easy. you can't stay clear of this guy. he will be on this until the end of time.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what do we do? we change the scam?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{there is no scam! i've got a fucking sign on my back! i can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. you get it? it's over. we walk.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{jake }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what do i always tell you guys? don't spend it all. sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. save some. put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. that's it. the gig's up.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{that's it? what are you talking about? we can still do this!}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{jake, i mean, come on }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, no, no! not this time. i am doing this for your own good! you guys have got to learn when to stop. you with the armani! you with the hookers!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{escorts!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do you even remember al? do you remember what he looked like sitting there?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you are such a raving pussy sometimes.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, we fucked once, honey. that hardly makes you a good judge of character. and don't think i didn't know you were working some angle with that either.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{everyone's working an angle, right?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{there are three people i trust him, him and a guy who got killed. i don't know who you are! you're like some stray doq that wandered into the house. so i'm telling you to cut loose of this. no one's looking for you, not the king, not moonan and not gillette. just go wherever it is you would go. it's over.}
<A>__{lily looks around the room. no one seems to be backing her up.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{what about...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what about what?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{what about the money?}
<A>__{jake stops and levels a look at lily.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so there it is. you got that big itch you need to scratch. it's all about the fucking money. what do you want, an apology?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{no, i want my cut!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. there is no cut.}
<A>__{lily levels a look of utter contempt at jake.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}
<A>__{with that, she grabs her coat and leaves. lupus sits quietly, taking it all in.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{so that's it...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{king ain't gonna like this.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{don't worry, i will settle up with your boss. we haven't skipped town yet.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{what i'm saying is, is that the king ain't gonna care. see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy, if you ask me i think he's jealous.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{of what? they're both crooks.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{exactly. `cept this gillette guy. he gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. meanwhile, the king sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{my fucking heart bleeds.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{your buddy. that fat guy. the king couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. he didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. it ain't personal. it's business.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{point, lupus. give us a pointerior}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you nexterior and he don't even like you, jake.}
<A>__{lupus stares blankly at jake.}
