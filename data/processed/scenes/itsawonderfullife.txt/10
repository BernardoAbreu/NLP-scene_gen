<L>__{interior bailey's private office day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{george's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. he looks tired and worried. he is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. nearby, in a throne like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits henry f. potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. the following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{i'm not crying, mr. potter.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{all i'm asking is thirty days more...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{pop!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{just a minute, son.}
<P>__{(to potter)}
<D>__{just thirty short days. i will dig up that five thousand somehow.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(to his goon)}
<D>__{shove me up...}
<A>__{goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{pop!}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{times are bad, mr. potter. a lot of these people are out of work.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{then foreclose!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{i can't do that. these families have children.}
<B>__{medium close shot potter and bailey}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{pop!}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{they're not my children.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{but they're somebody's children.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{are you running a business or a charity ward?}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{well, all right...}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{not with my money!}
<B>__{close shot potter and bailey}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{mr. potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character? you have no family no children. you can't begin to spend all the money you've got.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{so i suppose i should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.}
<A>__{george cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. he comes around in front of the desk.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he's not a failure! you can't say that about my father!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{george, george...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're not! you're the biggest man in town!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{run along.}
<A>__{he pushes george toward the door.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{bigger'n him!}
<A>__{as george passes potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's shoulder. the goon puts out a restraining hand.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{bigger'n everybody.}
<A>__{george proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. as they go:}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{gives you an idea of the baileys.}
