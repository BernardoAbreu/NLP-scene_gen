<A>__{evan, kayleigh, lenny and tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation. when evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt,}
<B>__{smoldering.}
<A>__{the mailbox... tick tock, tick tock... like a staring contest.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{maybe it went out. should someone check it?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yeah, you do that, lenny.}
<A>__{suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. mrs. halpern, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. across the street, tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of lenny's shoulder.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{make one peep and i swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.}
<A>__{tommy's words make evan flinch. from inside the car, a baby begins to cry. mrs. halpern walks back to the car. evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. he pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach.}
<C>__{mrs. halpern}
<D>__{how's my sweet girl? awww, you need a change, don't you honey?}
<A>__{mrs. halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. as the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids break into wide smiles of relief. but wait... the mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to the mailbox. now tommy is the only one left still smiling.}
<C>__{mrs. halpern}
<D>__{you want to open the door, honey?}
<A>__{the baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment angle on kids' faces boom!!! the blast is deafening. evan, kayleigh and lenny watch the results in stunned horror.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{c'mon! run!!}
<A>__{evan and kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that lenny isn't with them.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{lenny? come on!}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{oh my god oh my god...}
<A>__{lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road. evan and tommy double back and grab him. they try to make him break out into a run, but lenny's feet drag limply against the ground. both tommy and evan grab an arm and begin to run with lenny through the woods. flash!}
