<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen morning, moments later.}
<A>__{frank and april sit across the kitchen table, eating. for several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's kinda nice having breakfast without the kids for a change.}
<A>__{april reaches out to pour him some orange juice. her hands shake slightly.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. i thought you'd probably want a good breakfast today. i mean it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it? isn't this the day you have your conference with pollock?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yes. that's right, yes.}
<A>__{he shrugs.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{big deal.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i imagine it is a pretty big deal; for them, anyway. what exactly do you think you'll be doing? you never have told me much about it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{haven't i? well... i think this whole thing is about knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers, bigger than the `500'. did i tell you about that?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no, i don't believe you did.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, you know basically it's just a...a big, fast adding machine. only...}
<A>__{he takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately sketches the computer on the napkin.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{instead of mechanical parts, you see, it's got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes.}
<A>__{she picks up the drawing and looks at it. it's surprisingly delicate.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, i see. at least i think i see; yes. it's really sort of interesting, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, i don't know, it's yeah, i guess it is sort of interesting, in a way.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you should value what you do frank. you're obviously good at it.}
<A>__{he smiles, flattered and surprised. he slips the pencil into the inside pocket of his suit.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{guess i'd better be getting started.}
<A>__{he stands. april stands up too, smoothing her skirt.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{listen, though, april; this was really nice... i mean it was a swell breakfast. really; i don't know when i've ever had a a nicer breakfast.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{thank you... i'm glad; i enjoyed it too.}
<A>__{they stand there gazing at one another across the table. suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears. he turns and walks to the door. he puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{then you don't you don't hate me, or anything?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no; of course i don't.}
<A>__{she comes over to him.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{have a good day.}
<A>__{he leans down and kisses her tenderly. they look at one another a moment longer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, then... so long.}
<A>__{he steps through the door. she catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen.}
