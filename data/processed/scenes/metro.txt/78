<D>__{i want a car. like a four wheel drive. i want it in perfect condition. i want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. i want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. then we'll come out. i don't want any remote control devices in it. i know all the tricks. if it's not in perfect condition, and i mean if its even low on wiper fluid, i'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.}
