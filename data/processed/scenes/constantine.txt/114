<L>__{interior trading room}
<A>__{monitors are powering up around the room. a few of those young businessmen we last saw at midnite's are here.}
<C>__{young turk}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hey, early bird is a fat bird, know what i'm sayin'?}
<A>__{balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug and successful businessman he is. he stops at a long mirror on one wall. adjusts his collar, his hair. his "look."}
<C>__{pretty boy}
<D>__{what are we pushing today, sir?}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{phillip morris.}
<A>__{as balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts slightly. the demon in him? he touches his face, does a vowel stretch. his face distorts even further. that's got him moving closer to the mirror. balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears in motion, rippling as if liquefied. and just when he sees the surface of the mirror blistering and starts to move booom one way glass explodes outward on the front edge of a fireball sending balthazar flying with glass and flame. john stands on the other side in an access channel that dragon's breath flamethrower now duct taped to his holy shotgun.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how's he doing it?}
<A>__{john steps into the trading room, eyes balthazar rising from the floor. suit's in shreds, half his face is burned off, but now he's pissed.}
<C>__{balthazar}
<D>__{this is in direct violation of the balance!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{screw the balance.}
<A>__{john hits him with another blast of flame pins him hard against the wall. balthazar's young turks attack. one leaps over the trading station. john swings around aims the shotgun boom half breed is blasted midair. the other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers across the ceiling. john aims up pumps several rounds steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a desk. boom boom that'll keep it down.}
