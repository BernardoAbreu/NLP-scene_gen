<A>__{the judge grim, willy panicked, crawford calm.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{he had my witness list. he should have filed to suppress.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{my mistake. sorry.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. crawford, i warned you about representing yourself.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what about the fact that it's true? i mean, isn't that the point here: to get to the truth?}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. slocum is it true?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't know. i only heard about it five minutes ago.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{put him back on the witness stand if you don't believe me.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{we can't put him back on now! not after what the jury just saw. your honor, i told you this would turn into a circus. first he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{my dick has evidence.}
<A>__{the judge and willy look at crawford like he's truly insane.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{my investigator. i call him dick. i guess i should call him as a rebuttal}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{witness? he's got phone records, credit receipts, photographs, videotapes all documenting the affair. in graphic detail.}
<P>__{(beat. mildly:)}
<D>__{dick is good.}
<A>__{the judge looks at willy. this is bad. thinking fast:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{okay um: i will stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming ...and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial }
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. slocum your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{actually, while obtaining my so called "confession."}
<A>__{willy stares at crawford, shaken. understanding the trap.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no way. your honor }
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior they were alone in the house. the confession is no good.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{oh come on!}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{is this a legal argument? "oh come on"?}
<C>__{willy}
<P>__{(whirls on him)}
<D>__{you want to get into it?!}
<A>__{crawford raises his eyebrows. awkward silence. willy takes a deep breath. turns to the judge.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he dictated and signed his confession, after that incident.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{in police custody. arguably, in fear for his life. i'm sorry, mr. slocum it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.' we have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by lieutenant nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this is insane!}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's biblical, isn't it? the fruit and the tree and }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{he set this up! don't you see what he's doing?!}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{yes, i do. and i don't like it. but it's done, so we have to deal with it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{do you think i could go home today, your honor? with thanksgiving around the corner }
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{don't push it, mr. crawford.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what we're going to do is give mr. slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence. if he doesn't then you can go home. that's going to put us into the long weekend. we reconvene monday morning.}
<A>__{willy just stands there: blind sided, shell shocked. crawford smiles at him.}
