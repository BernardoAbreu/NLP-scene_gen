<A>__{edgar, atop the roof of the building that sits above the water treatment plant. he is watching his handiwork; the screams in the night, the burning fires, the haze rising up, cloaking the city. then down below, he sees a figure approaching. he knows who it is. silus is coming to him. cut to}
<L>__{int: jamestown slum, hideout, cell continuing}
<A>__{lilly, in her cell. she is working the chains that bind her hands against the pipe. she's rubbing them desperately, harder, harder. then she stops. she can hear someone approaching. edgar appears in the doorway; still and poised. then he turns, listening. a creaking echoes through the tunnels as if an iron door, somewhere above, has been opened.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{he's coming little one. he's coming for you.}
<A>__{edgar takes one more blinking look at lilly and then leaves, slamming the large iron door behind him. lilly pulls at the chains, hoping against hope that they'll break. they don't.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she now looks above. the pipe her chains are connected to runs up towards the roof, then takes a bend to disappear into the wall near the door. she bangs on the pipe. there is a little movement where it goes into the wall. just enough to give her some hope. lilly struggles now to her feet. she slides the chains up. to get the chains over the bend she'll have to jump. she does, sliding the chain over the bend. now she hangs from the pipe, the chains cutting into her wrists viciously, making her groan. she then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding along the pipe until she is near the door. she then reaches up with her feet and kicks at the wall, pushing, trying to dislodge the pipe. it moves, water leaks from it. but it does not give way. a desperate beat. then she reaches down to the door with her foot. she tries to force down the door handle, her foot wet and slippery. finally she gets the handle down, opens the door so that it clangs against the wall.}

<D>__{hello! i'm down here. silus...}
<A>__{her hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into her wrist. she cries out in pain. cut to}
