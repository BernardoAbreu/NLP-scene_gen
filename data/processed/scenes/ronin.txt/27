<L>__{interior the fiat later night}
<A>__{the two men drive in silence for a moment. vincent lights a cigarette and offers one to sam, who refuses. finally, sam speaks.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i needed to see if you were a cop.}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{i'm a popular man with the police, sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. and that's the guy you have to watch out for.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hate cops...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(insulted that vincent would even consider it)}
<D>__{well i ain't a cop.}
<A>__{a beat, the two men driving in silence.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that there was a gun pointed at me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i saw you look off when francois nodded his head. i figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(as if it's obvious)}
<D>__{because that's what i would have done...}
