<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior town hall night}
<A>__{most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed children. hewitt's burgundy pickup breaks alongside the audi. wade swings open the passenger door, jumps to the ground:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{lillian!}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{where's jill?}
<A>__{lillian, 40, attractive in an ankle length hooded coat. whatever pose wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. her dress and demeanor set her apart.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{me and jill, we just had a little spat. she felt kind of left out, i guess, from not knowing some of the new kids }
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{where is she now? is she in the truck with your friends?}
<A>__{jack and hettie neck inside the cab.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{she told me she wanted to wait for you. inside.}
<A>__{jill at the window in her tiger mask. lillian waves; jill motions she'll be down.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{while you went off for a few beers with your friends? is that hettie rodgers there, with whatzizname?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{she's grown up some, hasn't she?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{oh, jesus, lay off, will you? it looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for christ's sake.}
<A>__{horner, 45, lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair and a tyrolean hat, sees jill at the entrance and heads toward her.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{horner! leave her be. this's got nothing to do with you, so just act like the chauffeur. got it?}
<C>__{horner}
<D>__{wade. nobody wants any trouble.}
<A>__{horner greets jill, walks her to the silver audi. passing parents, listening, give wade a wide berth.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i don't want her to go, lillian.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{don't cause a scene. no one's trying to win any 'rounds'. don't make it any worse.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i'm not making it any worse. you are. me and jill could've worked this thing out. it's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. believe it or not. how do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?}
<A>__{horner opens the car door for jill, shuts it. wade shoves him:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{just wait till we're through, goddamnit!}
<A>__{horner's hat falls. lillian, icy, stares at wade. he backs off. wade sometimes wonders: how'd lillian pittman of lawford, n.h., get so much class?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{don't you say a word. i didn't hit him. i'm not going to hit anybody.}
<A>__{horner sits behind the wheel. lillian silently stares wade up and down, gets in the car beside jill. the automatic locks latch as the audi drives away. its taillights merge with vanishing traffic. wade looks down, picks up horner's dark green tyrolean hat, examines it, as if unsure of its function. wade walks toward town hall. margie fogg, exiting, greets him:}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{new hat?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{jill's up, i see.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(vague)}
<D>__{for a while.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{how's she doing?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{okay. she's fine.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? i'm off.}
<A>__{nick wickham, 45, marg's boss, passes by:}
<C>__{wickham}
<D>__{like hell you are. tomorrow's first day of deer season. i will need you at least in the morning.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{well, that's that.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(walks off)}
<D>__{take care, wade.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you be careful of that little bastard. he's dying to get in your pants, you know.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{don't worry. i can protect my virtue. i mean, c'mon, wade, give me a break.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{see you tomorrow, maybe.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{wade, lost in thought, continues toward town hall. at the door, lariviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. wade tosses horner's hat inside.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{tomorrow, gordon.}
<C>__{lariviere}
<D>__{watch this snow. it's coming down tonight.}
<A>__{wade nods as he lights a cigarette. alone, he watches the last cars pull out. he holds his jaw.}
