<L>__{exterior 124 bluestone rd. day.}
<A>__{now, stamp paid feels the need to find out what's going on inside 124 since he caused paul to leave. he approaches the porch, then the front door. he raises his hands to knock but he can't bring himself to do it. he turns to walk away then stops. he turns back and with a force of will, knocks loudly upon the door. no answer. he knocks again. still no answer. he steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. he turns to leave when he sees; two heads in the window. denver and beloved. denver bolts away, but beloved remains a moment longer looking in stamp paid's eye, then disappearing into the house. stamp paid is unnerved by her look.}
