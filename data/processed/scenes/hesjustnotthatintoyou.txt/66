<C>__{janine}
<D>__{javier.}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{javier, if i asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{good. because i think some of your guys have been smoking.}
<A>__{janine looks at javier. it's awkwardly silent.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{javier?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{is that the question?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{oh. it seemed like a statement.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{the question part was implied }
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{i didn't really hear it in the inflection }
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{javier have your guys been smoking or not?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{no, ma'am. my guys don't smoke on the job site. they're all good guys.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{are you sure your guys aren't sneaking around here? and smoking? and lying to me? and smoking?}
<A>__{she's starting to freak javier out.}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i need you to be honest with me, javier. because i can't have someone lying to me. to my face. under my roof. on my time.}
<C>__{javier}
<P>__{(very softly)}
<D>__{that's a lot of prepositions...}
<A>__{janine does not hear him, and barrels on }
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there? is there? i mean, we made promises to one another }
<A>__{javier looks at her what the hell is she talking about?}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{what i mean is, we had a contract. which is like making promises to each other, right?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{maybe i should just get back to work.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{yes. fine. good idea.}
<A>__{javier starts to leave.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{but, we're good here, right? me and you?}
<A>__{blank stare from javier. janine slaps on a smile.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{okay, great. the molding really does look great.}
<A>__{javier gives a forced smile, and heads back to work.}
