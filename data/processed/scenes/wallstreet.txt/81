<L>__{exterior gekko's beach house dawn}
<A>__{the sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean. gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him. he's been up all night and has an exhausted, driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone...}

<D>__{money never sleeps pal. when i came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, london's deregulated, the orient is hungrier than us. just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. i just made $800,000 in hong kong gold. it's been wired to you play with it. you done good, but you gotta keep doing good. i showed you how the game works, now school's out.}
