<D>__{this is doyle, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{tom, i've got something real big for you.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{look jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be }

<P>__{(interrupting harshly)}
<D>__{listen to me! lisa's been arrested.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(slightest pause)}
<D>__{your lisa?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{my lisa. she went into thorwald's apartment, and he came back. the only way i could get her out was to call the police.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i told you that }
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i know what you told me! she went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{like mrs. thorwald's wedding ring. if that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(grudgingly)}
<D>__{a possibility.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(talking fast)}
<D>__{a fact! last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. why? because he had something buried in there. something a dog could scent.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{like an old hambone?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(fast)}
<D>__{i don't know what pet name thorwald had for his wife. and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. he wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you think perhaps it was "old hambone?"}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{in sections! and one other thing, doubting tom it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance! if he called his wife the day she left after she arrived in merritsville why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(after pause; a detective)}
<D>__{where'd they take lisa?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{precinct six. i sent a friend over with bail money.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{maybe you won't need it. i will run it down, jeff.}
