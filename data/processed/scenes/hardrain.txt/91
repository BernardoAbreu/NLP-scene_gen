<D>__{bullshit. this is all bullshit.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i knew charlie when we were both working construction for the johnstown company. his middle name was mccarthy because his parents loved charlie mccarthy on the radio. his wife's name was mary. she died of a heart attack last year. he has a daughter and a son, both grown with children of their own. i'm afraid i don't know the names of the grandchildren.}

<A>__{jim casually aims his gun at tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will tell you where it is. but it's not going to do you any good.}
<A>__{jim arches an eyebrow.}
