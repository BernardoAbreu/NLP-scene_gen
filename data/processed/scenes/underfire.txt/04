<A>__{jimmy, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against the wall. several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel. some are shaded by makeshift awnings, some are not. jimmy rises as price arrives; there is familiar ritual in their greeting. they cross the street together toward jimmy's waiting taxi, a hand painted purple old american car with the words on the door, "new people's taxi company" and jimmy's name in script above it. price hands a candy bar to jimmy.}
