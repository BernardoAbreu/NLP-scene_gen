<A>__{bean can't hear the t.v. because of his headphones. he takes out his toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads. he's intrigue. he swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this clever modern implement. he puts the electric brush down and checks his teeth in the mirror. he has forgotten to turn off the brush and so it vibrates off the sink and lands in the toilet. bean fishes it out and places it back on the shelf where he found it. he turns off faucet, then exits, turning out the light. david enters and turns the light on again. he takes down the toothbrush and cleans his teeth. he calls through the bedroom door.}
