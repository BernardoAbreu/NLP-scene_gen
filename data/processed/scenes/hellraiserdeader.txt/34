<L>__{exterior police headquarters day}
<A>__{charles and amy walk and talk. it's pissing down rain. charles hold an umbrella for the two to share.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why'd you give me this story?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{who else would have taken it? either they're going to think it's bull shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. but amy klein... tell me it's real amy.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's real or i'm crazy.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{well, either way, it's a good story.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i've got leads. i will know in the end.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you know, amy dearest, for the average person, hunger for knowledge is like hunger... for food. we want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite. then we're satisfied, and we stop. but you... you're like a glutton. you can't help over eating.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't see you complaining.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{but you see, that's the pointerior that's why i need you. because all that stuff i don't eat... i still want. so i send you in to do the eating for me, and so i get to experience it, without actually suffering any mental indigestion.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that's for me...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{nobody's forcing anything down your throat. correct?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you see, amy, you never grew up with all this catholic god and guilt stuff. it doesn't mean anything to you. i worry about god and heaven and hell. not during the day, you understand, but around three in the morning, it keeps me up. i want to know what's coming. what's up in heaven and down in hell, or even if there's nothing. it's useful, when you're making plans. so go find out and we'll tell the world.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know, charles, there's something vaguely demonic about you.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{did you know, the word "demon" comes from the greek word for "knowledge." as in "demonstrate."}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no, i didn't know that.}
<A>__{charles shakes his head, disgusted.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{american education.}
<A>__{they're in front of amy's hotel now. charles flags down a}
<B>__{cab.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{then back to your room, lie down in your coffin until the hours of daylight have passed, as is your wont then go get me my story. a}
<C>__{my}
<D>__{you don't have to worry.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i never do. i'm not here to save people and i'm not here to judge them. i just take `em as they come. and use them as they pass by. i will be at the soffitel.}
<A>__{charles hops in the cab and drives off as amy walks up the steps to the hotel lobby. amy watches him go, waves, then spins back towards the curb. she flags down a cab and hops in.}
