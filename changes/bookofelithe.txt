<LOC>__{EXT. FOREST - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled. STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold. A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral. It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on: A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare. Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair. As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING}
<ACTION>__{About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW, DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES}
<ACTION>__{The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues. THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body. ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers. THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks around again, checking its surroundings for predators. THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT. THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee? Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass, nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers. THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground. THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing him to us for the first time. He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear. Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat. Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT hanging from a frayed twine cord. His name is ELI. He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body. Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils, falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him. Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still. He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow. He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath. Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man. For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back. A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back. He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees. He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned- out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it. The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch. Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead. Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet. They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath. He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time. The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk. The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed. CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones. Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland. After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork, away from the city.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris. Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street. He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing. Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old- fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.}
<DIAL>__{ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR}
<ACTION>__{He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.}
<LOC>__{INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air. Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing. As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE. He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint, broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable. Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish, overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.}
<LOC>__{INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick, revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside. Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air. Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{KITCHEN}
<ACTION>__{Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust. He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open. Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND. Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BEDROOM}
<ACTION>__{A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door. No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth. Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them. He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up. He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{LATER}
<ACTION>__{Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat. He clasps his hands together in prayer.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast.}
<ACTION>__{He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so, we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for bringing me this far. I know my long journey's end is near. I ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won't let you down. Amen.}
<ACTION>__{He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey. You hungry?}
<ACTION>__{It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SUNDOWN}
<ACTION>__{The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string. He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog- eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more. Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing. He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MANY PAGES LATER}
<ACTION>__{Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else. A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli reaches into his pocket and produces: AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears. The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor. Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up. THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep. The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns. He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on now.}
<ACTION>__{The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard. He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt. The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY". Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash. The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up. She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it.}
<ACTION>__{She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not going to hurt you.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's what the last guys said.}
<ACTION>__{Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here.}
<ACTION>__{She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I can't.}
<ACTION>__{Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road. He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate. He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert. Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched, waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They exchange anxious looks. ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off.}
<ACTION>__{The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's. The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?}
<ACTION>__{He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap. Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What you got there in the pack?}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, that's what they all say. How about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look?}
<ACTION>__{BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.}
<DIAL>__{BANDIT #2 He's got a gun.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit, it ain't loaded. They never are. Ain't that right, old man?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(BEAT)}
<DIAL>__{Open the fucking pack or die.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't do that.}
<ACTION>__{The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Want us to do it for you? We can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off.}
<ACTION>__{Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft, even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's real important you boys listen to me and understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I'm under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful instrument.}
<ACTION>__{BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the hell are you, some kinda preacher?}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Something like that.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well I got news for you, preacher man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. He ain't here to protect your ass. Now take off the pack and set it on the ground.}
<ACTION>__{Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You fucking listening to me?}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back.}
<ACTION>__{The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how it's supposed to go.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All right, I had just about enough of this shit...}
<ACTION>__{He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack. If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt. Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood. Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! My fucking hand!}
<ACTION>__{Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What you standin' around for? Kiss him! BANDIT #3 What's he talkin' about, kiss him?}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's in shock. He means "kill him".}
<ACTION>__{A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing. Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill. It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt. The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told you you wouldn't be getting that back.}
<ACTION>__{Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.}
<CHAR>__{BANDIT LEADER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who are you?}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My name is Eli.}
<ACTION>__{And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword. He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing. She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next. He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take it and go on your way. And don't fall in with men like these again. No good can come.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him, puzzled.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why are you doing this?}
<ACTION>__{Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies. He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{LATER}
<ACTION>__{The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered with dirt. The best burial they are going to get. Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.}
<ACTION>__{The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him, transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you. You're... a good man.}

<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{He walks on, into the horizon.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up. He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out from where the roadway has been severed. Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze. The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below. Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see: TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE. The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK. Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES. FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try desperately to steer the barrow off the road. The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount. Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground. The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals. The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next. Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.}
<CHAR>__{ELI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. It ain't your concern. Stay on the path.}
<ACTION>__{Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene, but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And then finally, suddenly, is silenced. Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt. They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel. They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came, dust pluming in their wake. Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.}

<LOC>__{EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY}
<ACTION>__{More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops. The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon. A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town. Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs. He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world. HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun. Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner, entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed. It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK. It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America, but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new. The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town, badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing. Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH, hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.}

<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<ACTION>__{Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun. As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping. Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped together at the waist, each man leading the one behind. Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND. They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG. Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.}
<CHAR>__{CHAIN GANG BOSS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, move it!}
<ACTION>__{The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't return the look, just continues crossing the street as the blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.}
<LOC>__{INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST- APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods. Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.

Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it. The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but has no taste whatsoever.

The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE. The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well- groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth. He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches, everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.

There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood streams down his thighs. A real horror show. He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends. The two other brigands release Solara and whip around, scanning the horizon. They see nothing.
