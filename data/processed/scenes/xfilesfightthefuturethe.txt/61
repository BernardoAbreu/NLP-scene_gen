<A>__{the moon is rising over the horizon, across the curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush. when flying objects cross between it and us, their forms unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth. but they are moving towards us, silhouettes in the background of the moon. they move silently, their size increasing as they move closer. and then we hear them, moments before they arrive at our position, unmarked helicopters just overhead. hugging the ground as they blast across the dark texas night.}
