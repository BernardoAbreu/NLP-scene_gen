<A>__{it is glen. he backs nervously down to the foot of the stoop as hi stands in the half open doorway. glen comes to rest a few feet away from the stoop. he is wearing a neckbrace. the bridge of his eyeglasses is taped together. cotton wadding is stuffed up his nose, which is darkly discolored. he holds a rolled up newspaper. his station wagon is parked behind him, idling.}
