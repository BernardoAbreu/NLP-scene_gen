<A>__{night: the taxis are roaming the slick streets. sometimes after 2:00 a.m., travis pulls his cab to the curb near an all night delicatessen in spanish harlem. the streets are relatively deserted. travis waves to storekeeper as he walks past counter:}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{hey 'melio.}
<A>__{spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio. travis walks over to dairy counter in rear of store, picks out a pint of chocolate milk, goes over to the open cooler and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches. he overhears a voice as he looks at the sandwiches. when travis returns to the counter with the chocolate milk and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a young black man holding a gun on 'melio. the stick up man is nervous, hopped up, or both; he bounces on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis shoes a strung out junkie on a desperation ride. the stick up man, a thorough unprofessional, doesn't notice travis. 'melio watches the stick up man closely, deciding what to do himself.}
<D>__{stick up man}
<P>__{(shaking gun)}
<D>__{come on, man. quick, quick, quick. hand over that bread.}
<A>__{it doesn't take travis long to decide what to do: without hesitation he pulls his .32 from his jacket pocket.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{hey dude!}
<A>__{the stick up man, surprised, turns toward travis, finding only an exploding .32. the man's lower jaw bursts open with blood as he reels and crashes to the floor. there is no emotion on travis' face. as the stick up man falls, 'melio leans over the counter, wielding his battered .38. he is about to fire when he realizes the man is already dead. 'melio, charged up, turns his gun toward travis, then, realizing the danger is over, lowers it again.}
<D>__{'melio thanks, man. figured i'd get him on the way out.}
<A>__{travis sets his .32 on the counter.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{you're gonna have to cover me on this one, 'melio. i can't stay for the cop show. 'melio you can't do that, travis. you're my witness.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{the hell i can't. it's no sweat for you. what is this for you, number five?}
<A>__{'melio smiles and holds up four fingers:}
<D>__{'melio no, only four.}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{alright, travis, i will do what i can.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<A>__{travis exits. 'melio picks up the phone and starts dialing. the bloody body lies on the floor unmoving. travis, still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and sandwich, walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab. the street is deserted.}
