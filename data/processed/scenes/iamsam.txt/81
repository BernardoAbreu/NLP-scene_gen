<L>__{interior courtroom one hour later}
<A>__{turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness. he's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you. this man is razor sharp. the therapist who evaluated sam is on the stand. sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the desk he sits at with rita. projected on a screen is a slide of the drawing lucy made in school.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{...there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here. as you can see from her drawings, she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility. lucy feels she has to take care of her father. although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection. "true feelings revealed"?!}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{the state is paying miss geller for her opinions }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{then every child who rages because they didn't get to stay up for that extra hour of tv }
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{objection your honor }
<A>__{sam tugs at rita's sleeve. she ignores it.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{...in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they didn't want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for foster care.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{objection.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think they want you to stop.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{really?! thank you, sam.}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{we all appreciate your assistance mr. dawson continue with your witness, mr. turner.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{now ms. geller, i assume in your therapy session, mr. dawson extolled his parenting abilities.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{on the contrary, mr. dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate that he was terrified he'd made and would continue to make and i quote: "huge mistakes, huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge."}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{rita starts to scribble notes furiously. so does sam. turner smugly sits down. rita confidently strides toward the witness.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{you're a mother, aren't you ms. geller?}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{would it be fair to say that as a parent, you've felt confused from time to time, possibly overwhelmed on occasion, even though you're a wonderful mother?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{objection. it's mr. dawson's parenting. not ms. geller's that's at question here.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{but if ms. geller has never had a moment where she felt confused as a mother it would bias her opinion. and it is her expert opinion we're all after, isn't it, mr. turner?}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{overruled. i will allow it.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{thank you, your honor. ms. geller, i know there have been many moments as a parent where i've felt i've made huge mistakes mistakes that are huge. and i've had to admit them to myself. my husband. but most importantly, to my therapist. which is the guise mr. dawson thought he was seeing you under, isn't that right, ms. geller?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{objection.}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{get to the point, ms. harrison.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{the point is you've never had those moments, have you ms. geller? moments that every parent i've ever spoken to has moments when you've felt the task is so unbelievably challenging that you feel retarded, disabled in some way. moments when you feel everyone has the key but you. but you've never had those moments, have you ms. geller?}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{i }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{yes or no?}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{i }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{let me rephrase the question. when your son od'ed }
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{but if ms. geller didn't feel she had made mistakes mistakes that were huge it might bias her opinion toward mr. dawson.}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{i will }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{thank you. so ms. geller yes or no when your son od'ed, did you feel you might have made mistakes, mistakes that were huge?}
<C>__{therapist}
<P>__{(tearfully)}
<D>__{yes.}
