<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{at the cut : many voices are swelling in a song of worship. it is a black baptist church, and the music has great energy. the white robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the podium.}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{i know you all remember that when moses came down the mountain, carrying the word a god, come down that sinai peak, he caught those israelites red handed. what he catch 'em doin'? he caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.}
<A>__{shouts of "that's right!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...he caught 'em with their backs turned on god!}
<A>__{more shouts of "that's right!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...he caught 'em worshipping a false god! a god of earthly things! he caught them israelites in decline!}
<A>__{"he caught 'em!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...because backslidin' is decline, brothers and sisters! you hear talk these days, and i know you've heard this talk, you hear talk of decline, well all that means is we done turned our back on god!}
<A>__{"that's right!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...people say civilization doin' this, civilization doin' that, civilization in decline! well it ain't no civilization! it ain't no them! it's us, brothers and sisters!}
<A>__{"amen!" we are tracking among the congregants, disproportionately women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing elaborate go to church hats.}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...it's what's in our hearts, each and every one of us when we like them israelites! slidin' awa a a ay down that godly slope, slippin' and slidin' toward the mire and muck a the stinkhole of greed that's decline!}
<A>__{"that's decline!" the continuing track brings us onto mrs. munson, wearing, like most of her peers, an oversized hat; hers is adorned with a great deal of plastic fruit.}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...and what did moses do when he saw those declinin' backslidin' never mindin' sinners?}
<A>__{"what he do?"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...moses smote those sinners in his wrath yes he did!}
<A>__{"yes he did!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...y'all know what smote is! i smite! you smite! he smites! we done smote!}
<A>__{"that's right!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...to smite is to go upside the head!}
<A>__{"uh huh!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that is the only way!}
<A>__{"yes it is!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...to smite is to remind! we got to stop that decline! and scramble back up to the face a the almighty gyod!}
<A>__{"amen!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...'stead a worshippin' that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island! that garbage island in that shadowland way outside the kingdom a god!}
<A>__{"way outside!"}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...that garbage island where scavenger birds feast on the bones a the backslidin' damned!}

<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...and so, let us pray...}
