<A>__{the men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out. a steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the wall and coming to a stop. two soldiers, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop without detonating. they are bug eyed, hearts stopped.}
