<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{dwight, caroline, toby and pearl sit at the table, eat ing. champ sits by dwight's chair obviously his dog. dwight seems unchanged by the two years. just now, dwight is in the middle of telling another of his "dwight is the best" stories. from the bored faces around the table, this is another in a long series.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{... so the s.o.b. had been on my back for a week at work, okay? sayin' i stole his wrench, an' poured oil all over his tools, as if! anyway, he went just one step too far with old dwight, okay? spat on the floor as i walked by. i turned around and walked back to him, acting so dainty and humble and scared, you know, all innocent and the minute he took his eyes off me, blam, i dry gulched him! i shut his water off good! never gave me another second's grief to this very day.}
<A>__{there is a pause. one more story. nobody has much of a reaction.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i heard kennedy on the news again tonight i don't know: i hate the democrats and the republicans, but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn't seem like...}
<P>__{(she searches)}
<D>__{... a liar.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{kennedy the senator from rome.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he gives me hope.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{i know what he gives you, and it sure as hell isn't hope.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's true he is attractive! and it may just be those white teeth that i respond to. but i don't think so.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to work for his campaign.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{no. too many republicans in this town. they hear my wife's working for the democrats, they'll take their cars someplace else to be fixed. bad idea. no.}
<A>__{there is a brief silence. suddenly caroline leans across the table and speaks to dwight in a loud, exaggerated disappointed whine:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, rickyyy!}
<P>__{(louder; same whine)}
<D>__{oh, ricky y y! please let me come down and work at the club!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, you treat me like lucy, i will act like her. i will be working for kennedy's campaign.}
