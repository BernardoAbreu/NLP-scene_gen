<A>__{the stranded oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white. the interior lights are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a grimm's fairytale.}

<A>__{she's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions, looking for the duct tape. despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath. a public service announcement plays on the car's radio.}

<D>__{... the national weather service has issued a winter storm warning for the entire eastern seaboard...}
<A>__{boxer shorts. socks. box of condoms. a copy of the tibetan book of the dead. a cheap radio shack telephone wrapped in its cord. a crow bar, which she tosses up to the front seat.}

<D>__{... carbon county residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches...}
<A>__{suddenly we see a blur of movement outside the car's foggy rear window... but she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice. finally she finds what she's looking for: silver duct tape. also a pair of scissors. she holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself. she climbs up front, rips off a three foot length of tape. again, in the b.g. more movement outside the car... but she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.}

<A>__{finally she glimpses movement outside the passenger window. she gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard. she doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear. after a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel. the windshield is fogged, so she wipes a peephole in the condensate. it's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood. she reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column. flicks on the headlights. a stranger is walking away down the middle of the dark road. she screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks. the stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with hunched shoulders. snow swirling around him in the darkness. who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm? over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.}
