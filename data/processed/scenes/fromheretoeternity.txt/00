<A>__{a small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. he is wielding a frayed broom. this is private angelo maggio. he is violent and funny and sour and friendly. he sees prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.}
