<L>__{ext st. peter's square night}
<A>__{up in the sky over st. peter's square, the pinpoint of light is tiny at first, then it shoots out to either side in a searing white line, then the white line balloons out on either side, expanding into a gigantic ball of hot white light. and then the sound hits. this is the explosion, and it is so much more ferocious than we could have imagined. the entire image is bleached white, with only the faint outlines of people visible within it. and then concussive force of the blast hits, like heat waves, rippling everything in its way. screaming and panic.}
