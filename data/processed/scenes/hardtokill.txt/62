<A>__{third floor corridor at elevators the killer hears this hears the elevator start up. he punches the call button. the other elevator opens. he plunges in just as: south corridor andy comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the floor, hurries forward sees russ and danny's bodies! she backs off in horror. andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone finds it's been cut. her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that storm's bed is still gone. storm's elevator the doors open revealing a dark, deserted seventh floor still under construction. he registers the opposing elevator rising his way jabbing again at the control panel ... exposed there ... doors wide open. wild stabs. any button will do just close the goddam door! ding! ford's elevator arrives. doors open. we make out the killer's form just as storm's doors close. storm blows huge relief. looks to see what he finally pushed ... shit! the 3rd floor button. he puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's got. the gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel. storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the emergency stop button. but the button jams! and storm's thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away! he can't reach it! he feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble strength. the doors open and andy crashes into him!}
