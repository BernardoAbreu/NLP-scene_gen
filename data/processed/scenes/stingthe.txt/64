<A>__{we hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, eddie niles, in the process of counting a large deposit. niles is all business; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it. he glances up for a second and sees gondorff "officing" him from across the bank. without a word he shoves the money he's been counting back into the hands of a startled customer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his identification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of the bank.}
