<A>__{enters into the street with his bodyguard and looks up to a top floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m.}
<L>__{interior the hotel theresa, cassius' room cassius before dawn}
<A>__{asleep with the television on. there's a knock on the door. barely awake, he gets up to answer it. it's malcolm. still in his familiar hat and overcoat. he hasn't slept...}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{i was leaving, saw the light on...how come you're up?}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(mumbles, half asleep)}
<D>__{...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here.}
<A>__{he goes back to lay on the bed. malcolm looks out the window...the wet streets at night.}
<C>__{malcolm x}

<A>__{malcolm's distracted. he fingers his glasses.}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(sees)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{you ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode?}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{tore out a picture of emmett till when i was little. couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. barb wire around his neck to a 75 pound cotton gin fan. took out his eye. the cruelty to it...i couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away.}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i thought, "what i do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" it made me feel ashamed. and that makes no sense. but that's what it was.}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{...when i heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th street church in birmingham?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the prohibitions of the honorable elijah muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. because birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... but dead children...are dead children. so the anger i felt, i had to contain. i locked that down! so tight my muscles seized. i lost control over the right side of my body. leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. "i'm having a stroke," i thought. i had to hold it in 'cause i wanted, all i wanted was to break something! break a part...any part of this system. because you are so provoked as a human being. in your spirit. in your heart... at the death of children. but i could do...nothing.}
<A>__{cassius is quiet.}
<C>__{malcolm x }
<P>__{(putting his glasses back on)}
<D>__{everyone knows... now i'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... so elijah muhammad has suspended me as a minister in the nation of islam for 90 days.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you can fix that...}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{i don't know. i will try when we get back. until then i will live each day as if i am already dead.}
<A>__{that statement surprises cassius, but he says nothing. malcolm x stands by the window and watches the day begin in harlem.}
