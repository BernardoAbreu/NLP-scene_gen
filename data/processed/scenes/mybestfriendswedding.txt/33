<L>__{exterior skyline cruise boat day}
<A>__{the skyline of chicago moves past us. slowly. the nbc tower, cityfront center...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{big weddings are so strange.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{you keep saying that.}
<A>__{up ahead, the wrigley building draws closer...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{kim has all this stuff to do, i hardly see her.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{well, you've got the rest of your lives.}
<A>__{reverse angle... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down the chicago river. wind blown. close together.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{getting your bed made. every day.}
<A>__{they smile at each other. seem so comfortable together.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you miss her, huh?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. i've got you.}
<A>__{she nods. that you have. staring in her eyes...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don't you throw up on boat?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if you like.}
<A>__{and she lurches over the railing, emitting a barrage of incredibly disgusting sounds, her feet flailing in mid air. he laughs, as he pulls her back down to the deck. of course, it was all a joke. he brushes back her hair. sighs. stares.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've been thinking a lot the last couple days. about us, actually.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{have you.}
<A>__{he has.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{well. there's a lot of memories to choose from...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's more than that.}
<A>__{that tightens her throat pretty good. when she tries to speak, out comes a dry croak that makes him laugh again. softer, this time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i mean, it's embarrassing to say it this way, but...}
<A>__{he stops. her eyes widen in a burlesque of anticipation. so he smiles. she knows how to put him at ease.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(straight back)}
<D>__{you've been the man in mine.}
<A>__{passing under the michigan avenue bridge. no one knows quite what to say.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and i was thinking this could be our last time. alone. together. you know?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{except for that.}
<A>__{she's smiling so easily. who would guess her stomach is double knotted.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can hardly wait for your wedding.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{me either.}
<A>__{she watches his surprise.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{boy, i never thought i'd hear you say that. can i come?}
<A>__{she holds herself together. real soft with...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i couldn't have it without you.}
<A>__{he's glad to hear that. and then...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's normal to have... second thoughts, huh? to be scared.}
<A>__{is this a change of direction? or is it the direction she's been praying for.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i wouldn't know. i never had that many first thoughts.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i mean, you commit to a wedding. and then it seems like... this... momentum, you know? you forget you... chose it.}
<A>__{she nods. understands.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you and i. i mean, in all our relationships with other people... we didn't use the word "love" a lot, did we?}
<A>__{we didn't.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimmy says. when you love someone. you say it, you say it out loud. right now. or the moment...}
<A>__{long beat.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... passes you by, yeah. she's a smart girl.}
<A>__{off in distance, the centennial fountain shoots an eight foot jet of water across the river. for michael and julianne it goes unnoticed.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we don't have a song.}
<A>__{hmm?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimmy and i. we don't have a song. is that a bad sign?}
<A>__{all julianne can do is shrug. then...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sings, softly)}
<D>__{someday, when i'm awfully low... and the world is cold...}
<A>__{she doesn't want to cry. so she puts all the strength she has into fighting it back.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{i will feel a glow just thinking of you... and the way you look. tonight.}
<A>__{he stops. smiles that sweet, boyish smile.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{dance card filled?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will check. i have it on powerbook, these days.}
<A>__{he holds up his arms. and she moves into them. he begins to dance with her, turning so slowly. and, yes, people are watching.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sings in her ear)}
<D>__{with each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart...}
<A>__{she holds him closer. bites her lip.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{and that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart.}
<A>__{he stops. he looks at her. she's still in his arms.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{where did we first hear th...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(straight back)}
<D>__{the night we met.}
<A>__{right to his eyes...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{the night we fell in love.}
<A>__{he doesn't know what to do with that.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so we heard it... like, right that... that first...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{we danced to it. just like this.}
<A>__{just like this. a long beat. and he has to say...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i won't lose you, will i?}
<A>__{her eyes close. then open. utterly lost in his.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no. because i won't let you.}
