<L>__{exterior bank night}
<A>__{everyone waits in silence. the lights. the limo. the driver waiting in the driver's seat. after a beat the door begins to open.}
<B>__{various angles}
<A>__{as cops' guns are brought to bear. on the apartment fire escape the old lady is asleep, her puzzle complete. the snipers raise their rifles. front of barber shop night sheldon stands there. the police radio network crackles: "they're coming out. perpetrators and hostages together. only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and etc." sheldon's eyes go to: his pov sniper a middle aged man who looks like an overweight accountant, in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through a telescopic sight at:}
<B>__{door of bank}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(letting murphy out first; yells outside)}
<D>__{get away from the car!}
<A>__{something that looks like a multi legged animal emerges. it is sonny and sal in the center of a tight group of the girls and mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides by hostages. over their heads is thrown some drapes from the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear head on sonny or sal without hitting a girl. in fact they can't be seen at all. this weird apparition appears, hesitates. the crowd yells: "shoot!" choreograph the action so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having been briefed. so they stumble about, make false starts, and finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second row of seats behind the driver. then sonny slides across next to driver.}
<B>__{various angles to cover}
<A>__{the police have no chance to shoot. the group looks like a bewildered centipede finding its way. mulvaney detaches himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on sonny's right.}
<B>__{on edna}
<A>__{standing alone, outside filled up limo. sheldon walks over to mulvaney's window.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to sheldon)}
<D>__{okay you got your one.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(to murphy)}
<D>__{you follow my car.}
<P>__{(he moves off)}
<A>__{maria gets in the rear most row of seats. sal next to her in the middle and then another girl. one woman, edna, a plain middle aged woman who has not said a word until now is left over. she stands by the side of the limo as the doors close and this phase of the operation ends, without mishap.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(elated)}
<D>__{fuck! we did it!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to edna)}
<D>__{goodbye, honey. wish us luck!}
<A>__{edna pecks out dry little kisses to the nearest girls. angle through sonny's door window as edna pecks... goodbye.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i will be a son of a bitch we're all okay! hey, man! honk the horn. let's go!}
<A>__{sal has his gun pointed on back of driver's head.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{hey, sal do me a favor... point that gun up, huh? we hit a bump and the fuckin' gun'll go off.}
<A>__{the driver honks the horn: they're ready. the crowd screams. cops keep jockeying for position, but there is no way to get a shot in.}
<B>__{on sheldon}
<A>__{no emotion. he steps into his car, a police car pulls up behind, and the procession starts to pull slowly toward the crowd.}
<B>__{on edna and bank}
<A>__{as the limo pulls away, she is bewildered by the rush of police, bank people, fbi men who stream past her, ignoring her, all pouring into the bank. tv crews move by and finally one stops to interview her.}
<B>__{on the caravan}
<A>__{being rammed through the jam of cops and screaming people trying to get a last look. the hostages looking out, wan, worried. sonny and sal inside, alert, ready with guns.}
