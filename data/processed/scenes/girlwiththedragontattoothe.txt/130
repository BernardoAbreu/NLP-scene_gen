<A>__{the cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor blomkvist can hear, and stays absolutely still, listening. blomkvist scrolls through the courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into photoshop. he was right. many more parade pictures were shot that day. several at street level a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. he reaches the first of the higher angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. harriet isn't in it. but in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. in the next, she's further into frame. and the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today.}
