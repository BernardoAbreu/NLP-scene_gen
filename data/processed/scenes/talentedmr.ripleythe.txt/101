<D>__{my dear tom, i'm getting out of this. freddie's death, silvana. i've thought about going to the police, but i can't do it, i can't face it. i can't face anything anymore...}
<L>__{interior ripley's apartment, palazzo gioia. night.}
<A>__{chaos. ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes, dividing them into two piles one for dickie's trunk, one for his own battered suitcase. he puts the license plates from freddie's car in dickie's luggage. he has placed one shirt on the ripley pile then checks again, and on seeing dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek. he takes dickie's rings, opens up a little box of buttons and needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. dickie's leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff links, ties, the mont blanc, dickie's passport, which he opens to scratch at the photograph , obliterating the face.}
<D>__{ripley (o s) ...i wish i could give you the life i took for granted. you've always understood what's at the heart of me, tom. marge never could. i suppose that's why i'm writing this to you, the brother i never had. the only true friend i ever had. in all kinds of ways you're much more like the son my father always wanted. i realise you can change the people, change the scenery, but you can't change your own rotten self. now i can't think what to do, or where to go. i'm haunted by everything i've done, and can't undo. i'm sorry, i can't go on. i've made a mess of being dickie greenleaf haven't i?}
<A>__{he's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope marked tom ripley and places the letter on top of the piano next to dickie's passport. his head is reflected in the distorting curve of the lid. as he puts on his glasses there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating, as ripley leaves behind his brief life as dickie greenleaf.}
