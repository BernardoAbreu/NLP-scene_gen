<C>__{frank}
<D>__{excuse me. you seemed like you were in trouble.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(steps over)}
<D>__{i'm all right. i just can't stand to see people tied up. i'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to noel screaming. the only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't seem so bad to me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{don't say that. i wanted to cut my father loose too. they told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and i go in. it's killing me seeing him fighting like that.}
<P>__{(gazes up building)}
<D>__{look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. i need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? i have to visit a friend who's sick.}

<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{mary takes a few steps, turns back.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. there's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. this woman i'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if i can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, i can be out quick. if anything happens, i will be in apartment 16m.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe i should come up with you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if i'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. that way she'll let me go.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nothing's going to happen. i will come with you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no, i will be fine. i'm just visiting a sick friend.}
