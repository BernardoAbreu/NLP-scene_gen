<L>__{interior child services night}
<A>__{after hours, the office is empty, half lit and eerily still. emily is photocopying at a work station, haunted by what diego said, the harsh upward light accentuating her tense features. the cyclical squeaking noise we hear is lucy, in emily's cubicle in the b.g., turning herself in circles on the office chair. something very creepy about the disappearance and reappearance of that pale watchful face. finished, emily walks back to her cubicle, thrown by the sight of lucy spinning in the chair, walking head on into that eerie intermittent gaze.}
