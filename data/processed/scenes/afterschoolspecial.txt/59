<L>__{interior the pretty kitty club night}
<A>__{we track the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor towards the light. each guy is in his own little world, matt and fred following deacon as he takes the first nervous steps. first the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the grinding blast of music, so powerful it seems to stop them in their tracks. their eyes bug out. scantily clad waitress walking by. as they move further into the club, they see actual strippers soliciting lap dances and some topless dancers onstage. fred smiles ear to ear. the guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only by the voice of a cocktail waitress.}
