<L>__{exterior narracott's farm. sunset.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots, when she sees ted returning. dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling joey with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side. mrs. narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at joey and then at dad. she is a good looking, intelligent woman, but clearly her life is always hard.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{what have you done?}
<A>__{dad stands shamefaced as albert the boy we have already met runs out of the house to join them.}

<A>__{she is stunned. she looks at ted and he just nods.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott }
<D>__{he's not worth ten! are you out of your mind? what about the rent?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he's a strong one, rosie. look at the way he holds his head!}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{how the hell are we gonna pull anything with that? ted you have to take him back. you have to take him back right now now.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{you have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.}
<A>__{joey bridles at the raised voices but albert takes the rope and tries to calm him.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no. no, please don't take him back.}
<A>__{suddenly we see dad's dejection. he is a man lost.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we can't take him back till he's broken in.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{and how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{i will train him.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}

<D>__{we have to keep him. we've no choice.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{right. well... you've got one month to break him in or i'm taking him back myself.}
<P>__{(she turns to the house, but then...)}
<D>__{how did you get to thirty what other fool bid you up that high?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{it was lyons.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott turns back towards the house, then stops, dazed, speaking almost to herself.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{we're gonna lose everything. after all we've been through we're gonna lose it all.}
<A>__{she turns back to the others the weight of the mistake heavy on their shoulders but albert quickly steps forward.}
<C>__{albie}
<D>__{don't worry, mum i will raise him and i will raise him good.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{well, you better. go on get started. see if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott storms into the house. albert immediately goes to stroke joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably. dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered, across the yard to the barn.}
