<L>__{interior library night}
<A>__{flames spread over a wall of bookshelves. title card: berlin, 25 years later a young man in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of the flaming books.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{he gets the scarab, you get the money, i get the girl... so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants.}
<A>__{three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the young man folds to the ground. a sweaty man named charleston (40s) lowers his gun, while behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{wha charleston, what oh my god are you... oh god he's dead, victor's dead... you've killed us! we had it he was right it was all in the bag and now we're dead, why? why, you stupid son of a bitch?}
<A>__{the owner of the voice, a man a bit younger than charleston in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps charleston hard.}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{cause the turk was right. after seeing her, after that night on the airstrip, after cairo everything changed, and he couldn't see the play through that one milky eye, but the turk was right about one thing, that there's nothing beautiful about money. she's beautiful.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{this isn't happening...}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{he'll never have her now. she's free. and i will never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it's worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that she's free.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{charleston. i can't be here...}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{you're not here. neither of us are. it's mowcher's gun.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{mowcher is at the bottom of the spree with a cowl in his neck!}
<A>__{charleston gets to his feet.}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{they won't find him for a week, and the albino will chalk it up to davey, he won't talk. we're clean.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{listen to you four months ago you were an investment banker! now you're nothing. the scarab's lost. the money's gone. it'll rot in the peruvian earth. it's gone.}
<A>__{charleston limps to the flaming doorway.}
<C>__{charleston}
<D>__{the man named charleston you met nine months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in jodhpur is dead. if we see each other again it'll be as strangers. as for the money... let it rot.}
<A>__{he exits, leaving mcguire stooped beside the crumpled form of victor. a long beat. the distant roar of an engine, tires squealing. then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful asian woman, early 20s. she gives a nearly imperceptible nod.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{he pats victor, who sits up, spitting blood. mcguire looks to victor and the woman for a reaction. gets none.}
<C>__{mcguire }
<D>__{wow is the word you're both looking for. wow.}
<A>__{the asian woman nods slightly.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(un wowishly)}
<D>__{you're a genius, stephen.}
<A>__{for mcguire is, of course, stephen.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we're a genius, bloom.}
<A>__{just as victor is, indeed, bloom. he spits.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{tastes like tin foil.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{so does real blood. buy you a drink.}
<A>__{stephen escorts the asian woman out, while bloom wipes his lip.}
