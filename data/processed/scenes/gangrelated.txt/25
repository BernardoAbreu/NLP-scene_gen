<A>__{rodriguez and divinci are sitting on the car, each with a beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{all they want is someone to go down for the crime, right? do we care who goes down for the crime? fuck no. as long as someone goes down for the crime. it's a slot that's gotta be filled.}
<A>__{rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him }
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{we killed a cop, doesn't that bother you?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{of course it bothers me. what d'you want me to do, turn myself in? well i'm not. that's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. so he got popped. it happens.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{not by other cops!}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{i patted him down! he wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was i supposed to know?!}
<A>__{a moment of silence, then }
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{look, i feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here. the important thing is we don't lose control of the case. we can never lose control of the case. whatever evidence there is goes through us. we lay down the trail. make it nice and logical. we're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{what're you talkin' about, are you sayin' we stick somebody with this?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{evidence points wherever we want it to pointerior shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin' killed him.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{you got some asshole in mind?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{just don't worry. we'll find a killer. there's lots of 'em out there.}
