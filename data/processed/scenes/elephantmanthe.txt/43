<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{wasn't mrs. kendal wonderful? i can't blame the king for wanting to marry her.}
<A>__{merrick closes his eyes and his head tilts forward slightly. it seems unbearably large: too large for him to support.}
<C>__{treves}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{goodnight john. sleep well.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you too, my friend. goodnight.}
<A>__{treves smiles at john then walks down the darkened hallway. merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. we hear the distant echo of treves footsteps. merrick goes back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different angles. he picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, and makes a few final brush strokes. he moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it for a long time. he lowers the brush to his side.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it is finished.}
<A>__{the cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if it were st. philips itself shrunk to a miniature. he goes to the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs his name at the base of the main spire.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{john... merrick!}
<A>__{he sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes the model towards the window. the movement causes him pain. he puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. he looks at the cathedral again, then around at his room. we see in the dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's picture on the table. a slight breeze billows the curtains. we move in very close to them.}
