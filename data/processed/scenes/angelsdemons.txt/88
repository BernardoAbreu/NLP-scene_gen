<A>__{ka chung! emergency lights switch on in the vatican archives, casting a weird, reddish glow over everything. but the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp. below, langdon pushes, again and again, on the deadened exit button, trying to activate the doors. nothing doing. he's weak, weaving, barely on his feet. chartrand's already slumped against a wall, his radio in hand, keying it over and over again, but getting only static.}

<A>__{langdon blinks, his vision becoming seriously impaired. he holds his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better. langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. then at the row of bookcases. gets an idea. he goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the glass wall. he hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase opposite it, wedges himself in. and pushes with one leg. the giant bookcase teeters, but just barely. langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the bookshelf. pushes again more movement this time. now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell. the bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return, starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall, which it slams into with enormous power and stops. leaning against the wall. forget cracks, there's not even a scratch. langdon curses under his breath, looks around for another idea. he hears a soft thud from the other side of the room, sees chartrand has slumped over, unconscious. but his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries in a shoulder holster. langdon's hand slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it. safe bet he's never held one of these before. he staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls the trigger. nothing happens. trigger doesn't even move. after a moment of oxygen poor thinking, he figures out how to click off the safety. tries again. (pow.) the sound of the shot is barely audible to langdon. his brain's going fast. if he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but there's a faint hissing sound coming from the bullethole, and he goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside. he stands back, his brain clearing momentarily. seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners, and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just made in the center. he raises the gun again and fires off four shots in quick succession. they're in an odd pattern upper left corner, upper right, not quite as high, lower middle left, and the very lower right corner. now there are four new holes, each hissing slightly, and the first hole, in the center. shaking his head once more to clear it, langdon steps forward to the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall and presses gently. almost immediately, a sharp sound comes from the hole beneath his hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up to connect with the hole in the upper left corner. he presses just a touch harder and a second crack starts, shooting down to the lower right. then a third, and a fourth, the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities connecting with the central hole, and with a huge groaning sound the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet. air rushes into the vault. and, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the archives.}
