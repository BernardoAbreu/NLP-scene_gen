<L>__{ext meadow day}
<A>__{a gorgeous, sun dappled day. tall grass waving on the breeze. butterflies skittering. william, 11 months old, toddles into view. he doesn't get far. plop! down he goes, right on his ass. his face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into tears. elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and comforting him. victor rises from a picnic blanket to join them. nanny justine looks up from her task of laying out the silverware and food.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{poor william! what indignant tears!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{there, there... shhh...}
<A>__{victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. the child shrieks and wails, held aloft.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{victor, have a care! you'll make him dizzy!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the world is a dizzying place.}
<A>__{she tries to reclaim the baby. victor feints, keeping willie out of reach. elizabeth grows crosser:}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{oh, do give him here! he needs to be comforted and held!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{he needs to vent his outrage to the skies! make yourself heard, willie! learning to walk is not an easy thing! why should it be so?}
<A>__{elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun to laugh. she glares at both of them. men.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{that's the nature of all progress, william. don't let your brother sway you otherwise.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{quite right!}
<A>__{victor cradles willie as if to shield his delicate ears. he peers at elizabeth with mock grave suspicion and speaks to the baby sotto voce, in deepest confidence, man to man:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{don't listen, willie. progress is a feast to be consumed. women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. or run before you can waltz!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!}
<A>__{victor waltzes the baby in circles. elizabeth stalks them.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{devil take walking, ladies! my brother shall learn to waltz!}
<A>__{he grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. there's no use resisting. she succumbs and they dance with the baby between them. justine is gasping with laughter.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{elizabeth, really! he's quite mad!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{scandalous! what would your dear mother say?}
<C>__{justine}
<P>__{(thinks a beat)}
<D>__{one two three, one two three, twirl two three...}
<A>__{laughing, victor and elizabeth waltz little william around in a sweeping arc. they pass within inches of the camera, bodies wiping frame...}
