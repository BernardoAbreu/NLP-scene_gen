<A>__{frightened pedestrians race past overturned cars. a parade float, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to burn. above it, a damaged balloon the cartoon character underdog is losing helium, warping and buckling in on itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. down the street, knox's ford escort is coming up fast.}
