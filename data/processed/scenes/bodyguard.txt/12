<L>__{exterior frank farmer's house back yard day}
<A>__{frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. strains of "don't walk away renee" come from a beat up transistor}
<B>__{radio.}
<A>__{an old fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass. throwing knives lay scattered nearby. a wooden post is sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. bill devaney, fiftyish, a distinguished looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well. he's rachel's personal manager.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{so, you won't protect rachel marron just because she's in show business?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't do celebrities.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{but the biggest money's in show business people.}
<A>__{frank says nothing. his eyes are closed behind the sun glasses. devaney picks up one of the throwing knives. he holds it carefully by the blade and throws it. it misses the post by three feet and clatters against the fence. frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again.}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(picking up another knife)}
<D>__{do you really do these things?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{isn't she the one who collects dolls?}
<A>__{this is enough to distract devaney from his knife throwing.}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{farmer, rachel marron is one of the most famous people in america. she's won every music award invented. she's got the number one song in the country right now and she'll probably be nominated for an oscar in her very first picture. and you want to know 'isn't she the one...?' christ, man, where've you been?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you mean she doesn't collect dolls?}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{yes. she collects dolls.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought i knew who she was.}
<A>__{devaney tries to size up whether frank is kidding him or not. frank's face betrays nothing. devaney gestures with a knife.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{you're probably deadly with these things, aren't you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{deadly.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{frank doesn't move.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{why are you resisting this job? $2,000 bucks a week.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{$2,500.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there are several good men available for that kind of money. have you talked to fitzgerald or racine? portman?}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{yeah. portman was interested...}
<A>__{he senses an opening and sits down beside frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{... but we're told you're the best.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's no such thing.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{farmer, we're talking about a very frightened lady. with a seven year old son. believe me, i wouldn't be here if i didn't think this was for real.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{farmer, she begged me to get you.}
<A>__{frank sits up finally and looks at devaney a long time. he picks up five throwing knives and stands up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right. i will come and i will look the situation over. if i take it, it's three thousand a week.}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(whistles)}
<D>__{okay. you must be very deadly for three grand a week.}
<A>__{frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post. he throws one of the knives. it misses the post and clatters against the fence.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{devaney's face drops. frank examines the next knife.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{i know it's something like...}
<A>__{the second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from devaney. devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and motions devaney off to the side.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{better not stand right behind me.}
<A>__{devaney smiles weakly. frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion. the knife sinks an inch into the center of the post. thump. frank's hand arching again. throwing the remaining knives. both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one.}
