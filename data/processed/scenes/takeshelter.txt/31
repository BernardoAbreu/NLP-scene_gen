<L>__{interior laforche home day}
<A>__{it's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing outside. the sound of rain pelts the windows and roof. curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the hallway. he passes the den and stops at its entryway. in the den, hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. she's on her knees looking out one of the front windows. a dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. what sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain smearing down the outside of the glass.}
<B>__{a thunder strike.}
<A>__{curtis flinches. he shows concern as heavier rain begins battering the house. the wind picks up making wood beams creak on their foundation.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{hannah.}
<A>__{hannah doesn't move. she continues staring out the window. the sound of the storm outside intensifies. windows begin to rattle in their frames. curtis walks over and reaches for hannah but is startled by the sight of a man's face just outside the window. hannah and the man have been staring at one another. the man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and out of sight.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{thunder cracks overhead. curtis scoops hannah into his arms and heads out of the room. bang. the front door rattles. curtis stops and turns back. bang. bang. the sound of someone kicking at the front door. the storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch. the power goes out. the entire house vibrates, like a freight train running across the roof. the banging at the front door continues, frame giving way, as the storm reaches its apex. curtis, holding hannah, kneels and braces himself in the entryway to the den. he covers the back of hannah's head with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder. then silence. a stillness. the rain stops. no more banging at the front door. the sun moves brightly though the front windows.}
<B>__{woosh.}
<A>__{the furniture in the den lifts off the ground. a couch, lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. it all hangs in the air, floating for a moment. quietly. curtis watches, eyes wide. a rumbling. grows. the sunlight vanishes. smash! the sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact. the windows blow out. curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to protect hannah. shards of glass splinter across his face.}
