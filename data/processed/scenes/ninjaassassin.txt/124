<A>__{room assembly room night raizo walks across the nightingale floor, his bloody footprints moving soundlessly. from the shadows he hears ozunu's voice}
<C>__{ozunu}
<D>__{you have not forgotten your training. you will always be mine, child.}
<A>__{raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his footsteps now bringing every sound possible. ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off a cloak of midnight.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{perhaps this is the best way for you to die.}
<A>__{his blade rises as like a cobra's hood, while the chain blade begins to spin.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the breath i take after you are dead, will be the first of my life.}
<A>__{raizo unleashes all his fury: the chain cutting with the power of an enormous buzz saw hacking timbers in half carving scars in the floors and walls braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but ozunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently waiting for raizo to tire, waiting for an opening.}
