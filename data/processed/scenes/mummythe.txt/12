<L>__{interior curator's office day}
<A>__{the curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's eyepiece at the key box. evelyn hovers behind him, excited.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{see the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of seti the first, i'm sure of it.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<A>__{jonathan leans in from across the desk.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{two questions. who the hell is seti the first? and was he rich?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom, said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{alright, good, that's good. i like this fellow, like him very much.}
<A>__{the curator picks up the map. it's actually the exact same map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i've already dated it, this map is almost four thousand years old. and the hieratics over here...}
<P>__{(inhales deeply)}
<D>__{it's hamunaptra.}
<A>__{the curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{my dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters. hamunaptra is a myth.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{are we talking about the hamunaptra?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. the city of the dead. where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. everybody knows the story. the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. on pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 b.c.}
<A>__{the curator holds the map closer to the burning candle lamp.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{as the americans would say: it's all fairy tales and hokum.}
<A>__{the map 'accidentally,' catches on fire. the curator throws it to the floor. jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out. lifts it up. the left third of the map is now missing.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{you burned it! you burned off the part with the lost city!}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{it's for the best, i'm sure. many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have never returned.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<P>__{(devastated)}
<D>__{you killed my map.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{i'm sure it was a fake, anyway, i'm surprised at you, miss carnarvon, to be so fooled.}
<A>__{the curator reaches for the key box. evelyn quickly snatches it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.}
