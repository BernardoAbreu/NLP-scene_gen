<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that sideboard there, you have any interest in that?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{this? well... no. i mean, why?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and i thought you might want that sideboard.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no, mom, i... i wouldn't have any way to get that home to colorado.}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{this food is just spectacular.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's so good }
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{yes, it is }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you like your food, mom?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i haven't tried much of it, yet }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{`s what she's paid for. a silent moment.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{y'all did know she's getting paid, right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jean, so i'm curious, when you say you don't eat meat, you mean you don't eat meat of any kind?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and is that for health reasons, or...?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{when you eat meat, you ingest an animal's fear.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{ingest what? it's fur?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{fear.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i thought she said }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how do you do that? you can't eat fear.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{sure you can. what happens to you, when you feel afraid? doesn't your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{does it?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{it does.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{adrenaline, and, and }
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{your body goes through a whole chemical process when it experiences fear.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{ yep, and cortisol }
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{don't you think an animal experiences fear?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you bet it does. i used to work in a cattle processing plant, lot of fear flying around that place.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{so when you eat an animal, you're eating all that fear it felt when it was slaughtered to make food.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wow. you mean i've been eating fear, what, three times a day for sixty years?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{this one won't have a meal `less there's meat in it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i guess it's the way i was raised, but it just doesn't seem like a legitimate meal `less it has some meat somewhere }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{if i make a pasta dish of some kind, he'll be like, "okay, that's good for an appetizer, now where's the meat?"}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{"where's the meat?" isn't that some tv commercial, the old lady says, "where's the meat?"}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{"beef," "where's the beef?"}
<C>__{violet}
<P>__{(screeching)}
<D>__{"where's the meat?!" "where's the meat?!" "where's the meat?!"}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{that's pleasant.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i thought the services were lovely.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes, weren't they ?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{preacher did a fine job. vi sticks her hand out, flat, wiggles it back and forth.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{ehhhhh! i give it a...}
<P>__{(repeats gesture)}
<D>__{ehhhhh!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{really? i thought it was }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{great, now we get some dramatic criticism.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{too much talk about poetry, teaching. he hadn't written any poetry to speak of since `65 and he never liked teaching worth a damn. nobody talked about the good stuff. man was a world class alcoholic, more'n fifty years. nobody told the story about that night he got wrangled into giving a talk at that tu alumni dinner...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{drank a whole bottle of ron bocoy white rum don't know why i remember that and got up to give this talk, and he fouled himself! comes back to our table with this huge }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yeah, i can't imagine why no one told that story.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i don't know much about poetry, but i thought his poems were extraordinary.}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{and your reading was very fine.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, german irish, really, i }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's peculiar, karen, to bring a date to your father's funeral. i know the poetry was good, but i wouldn't have really considered it date material }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he's not a date, he's my fiance. we're getting married on new years. in miami, i hope you can make it.}
<C>__{violet}

<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{that's been gone for years.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that made me so sad!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what is this now?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{our old fort, where we used to play cowboys and indians.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{bev made some good investments, believe it or not, and we had money for you girls in his will, but we talked it over after some years passed and decided to change things, leave everything to me. we never got around to taking care of it legally, but you should know he meant to leave the money to me.}

<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{sure, an auction's a fine idea }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{some things, though, like the silver, that's worth a pretty penny. but if you like i will sell it to you, cheaper'n i might get in an auction.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{or you might never get around to the auction and then we can just have it for free after you die.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{barbara... beat. violet coolly studies barbara.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you might at that.}
