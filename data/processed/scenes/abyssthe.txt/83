<A>__{monk leads his team along a corridor, following little geek's tether. through a hatch into the engine room. their lights play over flooded machinery.}

<A>__{from the berthing coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack center. he pulls at a buckled watertight door.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{it's jammed. give me a hand.}
<A>__{jammer and bud squeeze in around coffey. together they wrench the door open on its squealing hinges. it give way suddenly, flying open. the suction pulls something through. it slams bud's shoulder. he turns. a face... right in front of him! he jerks back, gasping. face to face with barnes, the sonarman. the ensign seems unmarked, merely dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth. coffey reaches past bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{alright, let's keep moving. we knew we were going to see this.}
<A>__{they enter the control room. their lights play over the high tech wreckage. floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents. a languid, weightless waltz. they move through the carnage. their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair, someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down. dead faces, pale in the lights. still. we see only glimpses. coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over. removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck. moves on. all business. bud turns back to his guys. checking them. he notices jammer is breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet. catfish, finler, and sonny aren't much better. a wave a panic seems imminent.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how you guys doing?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i'm alright, i'm dealing.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{triple time sounds like a lotta money, bud. it ain't. i'm sorry...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{we're here now. let's get her done.}
<A>__{we see bud working, calming them, talking them through it. he's sweating rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady. his projection of calm to the others is his own salvation. coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{this part i do alone. brigman, take you men and continue aft. split up into two teams of two. let's get moving... we head back in fourteen minutes.}
<A>__{bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.}
