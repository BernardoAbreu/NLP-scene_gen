<D>__{sam's address book.}
<A>__{she skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes are too powerful for her. she places it carefully into a box labeled "sam's things valuable" and continues packing. she finds the old jar with the penny in it. it's marked "for luck". she holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it on the nightstand beside the bed. carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of sam's jackets. he examines them.}
