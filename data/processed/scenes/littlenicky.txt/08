<L>__{exterior highway to hell day}
<A>__{cassius and adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls. both are pissed. there's a big, ugly, bigfoot looking monster hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{and he's dead serious.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{it's just such a slap in the face.}
<A>__{adrian turns to the monster.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{yeah, get out of here! beat it!}
<A>__{cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the monster's face. the monster shrugs and walks off.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{twenty thousand years ago, grandpa lucifer said, "it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven." well, i'm getting tired of serving in hell. we need a place where we can rule.}
<A>__{cassius throws a rock at the monster. he yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back. cassius sees this and gets enraged.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{oh you wanna be a big man? bring it on!! let's see what you got!}
<A>__{the monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{that's what i thought!}
<C>__{adrian}
<P>__{(to cassius)}
<D>__{could you concentrate for five seconds?}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i am concentrating. where can we rule?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{what do you think about...earth?}
<A>__{cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{we could create our own hell there.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you saying we go up there and kill everyone?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{eventually, cassius. but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{...their damned souls will be ours.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{it's our time, brother.}
<A>__{the two look at each other. they start running toward the fire wall. knocking souls out of their way.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{hey, what are you doing?!?}
<A>__{they get closer to the fire.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<D>__{you can't go through there. the fire flows in, not out.}
<A>__{they dive through the fire wall. it freezes.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<D>__{you know something? you guys suck! you really suck!}
<A>__{sirens go off. dogs start barking. lights flash. and we hear the sound of damned souls hitting the back of the firewall hard.}
