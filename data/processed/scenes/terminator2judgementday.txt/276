<L>__{interior house kitchen later}
<A>__{sarah puts out her fifth cigarette. she's sitting on the counter. john, terminator, dyson, and tarissa are at the kitchen table, under a single overhead light. dyson looks like that guy on the sistine chapel wall, the damned soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge. his shoulder is bandaged. terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood soaked bandage below the elbow. the steel forearm and hand gleam in the harsh kitchen light. tracking around the table as terminator speaks... we don't hear the words.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down. skynet. judgment day... the history of things to come. it's not every day you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths. he took it pretty well, considering...}
<A>__{terminator finishes speaking.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{i feel like i'm gonna throw up.}
<A>__{he looks around at them, clutching the table like he's about to blow away. his face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul wrenching terror. this is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim world. his voice is pleading.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{you're judging me on thing's i haven't even done yet. jesus. how were we supposed to know?}
<A>__{sarah speaks from the shadows behind them. dyson turns to find her looking right at him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah. right. how were you supposed to know? fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons. did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man? colt, browning, smith, thompson, kalashnikov... all men. men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up. you're so creative. you don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life. to feel it growing inside you. all you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mom, mom, we need to be more constructive here. i don't see this as a gender related issue.}
<P>__{(to the dysons)}
<D>__{she's still tense.}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. right?}
<C>__{tarissa}
<D>__{but i thought... aren't we changing things? i mean... right now? changing the way it goes?}
<C>__{dyson}
<P>__{(seizing on that)}
<D>__{that's right! there's no way i'm going to finish the new processor now. forget it. i'm out of it. i'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow... i will sell real estate, i don't care,,,}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{that's not good enough.}
<A>__{dyson's voice is pitiful.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{look, whatever you want me to do, i will do. i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{no one must follow your work.}
<C>__{dyson}
<P>__{(thoughts racing)}
<D>__{alright, yeah. you're right. we have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything i have here. everything! i don't care.}
