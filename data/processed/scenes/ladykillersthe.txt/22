<L>__{interior hi ho donut day}
<A>__{there is faint muzak and loud air conditioner hum. glass cases display donuts identified as glazed, jelly, and fancies. fancies ooze yellow goo. the jelly on the jelly donuts is developing a crust of age. the glazed also look moth eaten. one customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes. behind the counter is a middle aged vietnamese woman in a neat white blouse. the two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from underneath their windbreakers.}
<D>__{youth #1 all right dragon lady, give us all the fuckin' money!}
<A>__{the woman stares blankly.}
<D>__{youth #1 we want that donut money!}
<C>__{vietnamese woman}
<D>__{yao gin nyap!}
<A>__{a man appears from the kitchen in back. he is a middle aged vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. an ascot is knotted at his neck. he wears aviator eyeglasses. in his mouth smolders a half burned down filterless cigarette. this, we shall learn later, is the general.}
<D>__{youth #2 okay papa san, we want that donut money. youth #1 and we ain't fuckin' around, mr. hi ho.}
<C>__{vietnamese woman}
<D>__{hi ho.}
<A>__{the two youths look at her briefly. nothing else is forthcoming. the drunk looks up from his paper bag.}
<D>__{youth #2 look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't complicated. you give us all the fuckin money, you don't get shot in the head, you make more donuts, get more money. that's how it works, see?}
<A>__{the general stares at him. as with his wife, none of it seems to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.}
<D>__{youth #1 give us the money!}
<A>__{he is pointing the gun directly at the general's head.}
<D>__{youth #1 ...you got three fuckin' seconds. you understand one two three? i'm gonna count one two three and then shoot. okay? three sec huh!}
<A>__{the general has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside the youth's nostrils. his gun clatters to the floor. the fingers are way, way up his nose. only one knuckle shows on each finger. the youth is staring cross eyed at his own nose. his friend is also stupefied.}
<D>__{youth #1}
<P>__{(very nasal)}
<D>__{his fingers are way the fuck up my nose. youth #2 get... ya fingas... out... the man's... nose!}
<A>__{the general still impassively sucks on his cigarette. the first youth is on the verge of tears:}
<D>__{youth #1 i think they're in my brain, man... youth #2 motherfuck!}
<A>__{he raises his gun to start firing. as he does so the general uses his hook hold on the other youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some fancies. the door opens and a customer walks in, a semi elderly lady with a cane. youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, then back to the general who has his friend's head pressed into the fancies, then uncertainly over to the vietnamese woman who is loudly yelling at him in vietnamese. cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the general calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and tosses it into youth #2's face. youth #2 screams.}
