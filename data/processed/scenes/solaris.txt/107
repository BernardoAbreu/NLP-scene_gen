<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{interior conference room}
<A>__{kelvin, rheya, sartorius, and snow. they are in the middle of a heated discussion.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{gibarian was under enormous }
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{gibarian was helpless. it's very simple: man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris, and the ship that brought us here.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{that's fantastic.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{why did you agree to come here?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{too tired to answer?}
<A>__{looks at rheya, then back to kelvin.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{i will bet. is this what they sent you here to do? you've lost it, you've gone native.}
<A>__{kelvin moves toward him. sartorius just lets him come.}
<C>__{rheya}
<P>__{(to sartorius)}
<D>__{you're the coward.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{don't debate him; he'll say anything.}
<C>__{rheya}
<P>__{(still, to sartorius)}
<D>__{i'm just as human as you. i see, i hear, i touch, and i feel just like you do.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{prove it.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{these "guests" are a part of you, of your subconscious. chris loves me.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{you are not human! try to understand that if you can understand anything!}
<A>__{kelvin is within an inch of his face.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<A>__{slowly, carefully, sartorius grasps kelvin by the shoulders. then he leans in and whispers in kelvin's ear:}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{rheya is dead. she's a copy. a facsimile. and she's seducing you all over again. you're sick. you think of fucking her as research for humanity. it's just fucking.}
<A>__{kelvin backs away.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{there's nothing grandiose about it. you've jumped out of a plane and you're trying to sew a parachute together while you fall.}
<A>__{sartorius turns...}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{it'd be hilarious if it weren't so damn sad.}
<A>__{and leaves. a beat.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{we didn't even get to hear his new ideas.}
<A>__{snow wanders toward the door.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i'm not feeling well.}
<A>__{he passes kelvin and leaves. kelvin watches him, then looks at rheya. she seems dazed.}
