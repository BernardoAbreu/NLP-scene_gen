<A>__{color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing table. the top photos are like establishing shots, each taking in the entire display the murderer created. william examines with somerset looking over his shoulder.}

<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{what picture is he painting?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(figuring)}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{william has an idea. he ambles over to a row of cabinets where oversized art books are stacked. he hunts through a pile, shoves some books aside.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{i... i've seen things like that...}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{william keeps digging, finds one book, finds another. he opens one as he walks back to the drawing table.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's church stuff. christianity.}
<A>__{william lays a book down, finds a page. he opens it to somerset. there is a circle to the side of the texterior it says gluttony under the circle. somerset creases his brow, turns the page. william opens another book.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{when it first started... christian artwork was all from bible stories. it was like... nobody had any imagination. it was all... standardized.}
<A>__{william pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre, worlds of hieronymus bosch. horrifying religious visions.}
<P>__{william (o.s.,cont)}
<D>__{but, later, everyone started painting to tell their own stories... to teach lessons. guys like bosch, bregel the elder... van eycks.}
<A>__{william shoves the open book to somerset. somerset looks: seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving in to sins. wicked, grotesque people. somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.}

<D>__{the seven deadly sins.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{that's what these murders remind me of. paintings like these.}

<A>__{william goes to continue pulling other books.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{i can find more examples. there's lots of paintings like those... painted over hundreds of years.}
