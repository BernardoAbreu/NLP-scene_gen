<L>__{exterior beach later}
<A>__{joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap. people warm themselves at the fire. joel watches couples talking, kissing, rob sharing a joint with a guy.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you were down by the surf. i could just make you out in the dark.}
<A>__{joel looks down to the water. there's clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{your back to me. in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually. at the time i thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt. voice over i remember being drawn to you even then. i thought, i love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{but i went back to my food. the next thing i remember, i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.}
<A>__{a shot of the orange sleeve. joel looks up.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{hi there.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{hi. voice over i was so nervous. what were you doing there, i wondered. your hair was lime green. green revolution.}
<A>__{a shot of her green hair.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you said...}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i saw you sitting over here. by yourself. i thought, thank god, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah. i don't ever know what to say.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... i'm such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{even then i didn't believe you entirely. i thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? voice over but i thought, i don't know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{but, i don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? i mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? voice over and i just liked you so much.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{you did? you liked me?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you know what i did.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i'm fishing.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you said }
<A>__{she picks a drumstick off of joel's plate.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i'm clementine. can i borrow a piece of your chicken?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{i remember voice over the grease on your chin in the bonfire light.}
<A>__{shot of a smudge of chicken grease on clementine's chin.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh god, how horrid.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm joel. voice over no, it was lovely.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{hi, joel. so no jokes about my name?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you mean, like...}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', clementine... ? huckleberry hound? that sort of thing?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah, like that.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{nope. no jokes. my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll. i think your name is magic.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(eyes welling)}
<D>__{this is it, joel. it's gonna be gone soon.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{enjoy it. say good bye.}
<A>__{she nods. joel and clementine are walking near the surf.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{so you're still on the zoloft? voice over next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no, i stopped. i didn't want to feel like i was being artificially modulated.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i know what you mean. that's why i stopped.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{but my sleeping is really fucked up.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't think i've slept in a year.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you should try xanax. i mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. like insurance.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i will give you a couple. see what you think.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{have you ever read any anna akhmatova?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i love her.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{really? me, too! i don't meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i think she's great.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{me too. there's this poem }
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i think, before.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{seems too coincidental that way.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah, maybe.}
<A>__{joel and clementine wander near some beach houses closed for the winter.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{do you know her poem that starts "seaside gusts of wind, and a house in which we don't live...}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. it goes "perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines"?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yes! i love that poem. it breaks my heart. i'm so excited you know it.}
<P>__{(pointing to houses)}
<D>__{look, houses in which we don't live.}
<A>__{joel chuckles appreciatively.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i wish we did. you married?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{um, no.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{let's move into this neighborhood.}
<A>__{clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house. joel is nervous.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i do sort of live with somebody though.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{she walks to the next house, tries the door.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{male or female?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{female.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{at least i haven't been barking up the wrong tree.}
<A>__{she finds a window that's unlatched. she lifts it.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{it's freezing out here.}
<A>__{she scrambles in the window. joel looks around, panicked.}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{clementine. voice over i couldn't believe you did that. i was paralyzed with fear.}
<A>__{the front door opens and clementine stands there beckoning.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{c'mon, man. the water's fine. nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. this place is closed up. electricity's off.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i hesitated for what seemed like forever.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i could see you wanted to come in, joel.}
<A>__{he walks cautiously toward the door.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{as soon as you walked in. i knew i had you. you knew i knew that, right?}
