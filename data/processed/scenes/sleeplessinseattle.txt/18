<A>__{the two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for instructions. and now they both start to take off. in opposite directions. and we pull back back back back as the planes take off, one flying east, the other flying west. and further and further back as they soar into the air and leave the frame. the night sky. stars twinkle. and now tilt down to see the united states. it looks like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by saul steinberg. a light goes on in baltimore. a light goes on in seattle. they are the only lights on the map.}
