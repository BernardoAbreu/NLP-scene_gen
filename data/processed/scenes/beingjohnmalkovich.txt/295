<L>__{interior flemmer's apartment day}
<A>__{lester is watering flemmer's plants. a key is heard in the door. flemmer enters, a small carry on bag slung over his shoulder.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{how'd it go? did you say the philodendron gets water or no?}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{no, for god's sake, i just watered it yesterday.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it almost went well. i gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what kind of circumstances?}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet duel by mantini.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{the great mantini?}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{no, the mediocre mantini. of course the great mantini!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{oh, he's good! great, actually. i saw him do "tru" with his sixty foot robert morse puppet. sensational.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{but i think i have another plan.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(snippy)}
<D>__{do tell. i love a good plan.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{why are you being like this?}
<A>__{lester shrugs.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i missed you. i'm sorry. tell me the plan.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{well, if mantini wins, schwartz will leave malkovich, right? so, if he needs it, i help mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. spice up the show.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{can you do that? i mean, do you know anything about puppetry?}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{i am the devil, lester. i think i can handle it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i was just asking. no disrespect intended.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{fine. let's drop it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{fine. i mean, it's not like i was doubting you, it's just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{fine. i'm not mad. let's just drop it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{fine. your mail's on the kitchen table. mostly junk. oh, there's a letter from alex trebek.}
