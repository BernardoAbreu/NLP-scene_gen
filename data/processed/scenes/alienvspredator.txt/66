<A>__{a frantic tortured scream and several pistol shots are heard through the stone grate directly above them...}
<L>__{interior sarcophagus chamber}
<A>__{....as lex prepares to lead the team down the long dark corridor. bursts of bright light fill the room from above as it slices through the slats of the grate like lasers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{lex! what's going on!}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(to max)}

<A>__{sebastian looks at lex. he shakes his head. so does max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{fear starts to spread around the chamber.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{is there anything you didn't tell me about this place?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{nothing. i have no idea what this is.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{well, whatever it is, we're not prepared for it. we're going to round up the rest of the team and get to the surface. let's move.}
<A>__{lex stares down the long dark corridor behind weyland. max and connors open an equipment case. from within they start to take an arsenal of heavy weapons. they are joined by three other men bass, stone and verheiden.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{my job. yours is over.}
<A>__{max slams a magazine home into his mp 5 he does a lock and load with rapid precision.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i told you when i lead a team, i don't leave my team. my job is over when everyone is back on the boat safely and that gun doesn't change anything.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{mister weyland?}
<A>__{weyland looks at max and lex.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{she brought us here, she's getting us home. you and your crew back her up.}
<A>__{max nods, following orders. around the room, a series of machine guns are quickly loaded. the sound of the mechanical loading and cocking of the guns echo throughout the long corridor.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to lex)}
<D>__{after you.}
<A>__{lex consults her digital wrist compass.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{this bearing should take us back to the entrance. we make it to the surface and we regroup at the whaling station.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what about thomas and rousseau?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we'll find them on the way out.}
<A>__{and lex leads the team through the long corridor.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{stone ... verheiden ... cover our backs!}
