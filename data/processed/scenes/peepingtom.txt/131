<A>__{she kisses him very gently on the mouth. the bathroom begins to sound like a small waterfall.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{good night, mark...}
<A>__{he watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the door. a light goes on beneath the door. he stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera round and points the lens towards his lips. then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs. the waterfall cascades on. the screen grows dark and the dark room grows out of it.}
