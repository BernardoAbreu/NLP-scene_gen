<L>__{interior ripley's apartment a little later}
<A>__{burke and gorman are seated, nursing coffee. ripley paces, very tense.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no. there's no way!}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{hear me out...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i was reamed, steamed and dry cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? forget it.}
<A>__{we see that she's gut scared, covering it with anger. burke sees it.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, we don't know what's going on out there. it may just be a down transmitter. but if it's not, i want you there...as an advisor. that's all.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{you wouldn't be going in with the troops. i can guarantee your safety.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{these colonial marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state of the art firepower. nothing they can't handle...right, lieutenant?}
<C>__{gorman}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{we're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{what about you? what's your interest in this?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{well, the corporation co financed that colony with the colonial administration, against mineral rights. we're getting into a lot of terraforming...'building better worlds.'}
<A>__{burke is revealing his early days in sales.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. i saw the commercial.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i heard you were working in the cargo docks.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{it's all i could get. anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. days off are worse.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{if i go.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{if you go.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's a second chance, kiddo. and it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. you gotta get back on the horse...}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(frosty)}
<D>__{spare me, burke. i've had my psych evaluation this month.}
<A>__{burke leans close, a let's cut the crap intimacy.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{yes, and i've read it. you wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{no! the answer is no. now please go. i'm sorry. just go, would you.}
<A>__{burke nods to gorman who rises with him. he slips a translucent card onto the table, heads for the door.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{think about it.}
