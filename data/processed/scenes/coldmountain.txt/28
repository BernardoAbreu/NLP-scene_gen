<L>__{exterior black cove farm. day}
<A>__{monroe and inman and ada touring the farm. it's a biggish property, over three hundred acres. and well tended by the dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted about in the landscape. rolling mountains dominate the view.}
<C>__{monroe}
<P>__{(expansive)}
<D>__{i want to get sheep into this field. a big field doesn't look right without sheep. you're a lucky fellow, mr. inman, you've had this view all your life.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{it's a special view. i dragged my poor daughter to cold mountain from charleston because of my doctors they say my heart is weak so the air's meant to do me good. but it's the view i think heals.}
<A>__{ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving next to inman.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{i have to get on my visits. can i offer you a ride back into town?}
<A>__{inman looks at ada. no word.}
