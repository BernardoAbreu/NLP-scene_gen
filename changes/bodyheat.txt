Then, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As the band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a simple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moves wonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat. Racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward him. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes lowered.

The gun BLASTS once. One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD.

Racine shifts his head an inch and he can see another wire. It originates from that same spot back in the gloom and runs toward the door, although Racine, with this limited view, cannot actually see where the wire is attached.
