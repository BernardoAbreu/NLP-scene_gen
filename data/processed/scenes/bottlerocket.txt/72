<L>__{interior golf cart. day}
<A>__{in the cart. bob's driving. there's a brief silence.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{no, i don't mind.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i know it must of been a bad experience. but it doesn't sound like it was your fault.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{well, i didn't mean to electrocute him. but the whole operation was my idea.}
<A>__{montage: electronics wizardry. splicing wires. buzzing electrodes. a filament lights up blue. pliers and clippers rewire a circuit breaker, short out the p.a. system, electrify doors and windows. anthony continues in voiceover.}
<C>__{anthony }
<D>__{it took six months of research. i did all the wiring myself. switched ac to dc. doubled the voltage. shorted out the generator. the whole school was shut down.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{that's pretty complicated for a senior prank.}
<C>__{anthony }
<D>__{i don't like that word prank, bob. i was trying to do something more than a prank.}
