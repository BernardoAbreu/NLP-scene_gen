<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you blew it big time. she doesn't want you back.}

<D>__{does she know people are trying to kill me out there?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{she's counting on it. she's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. or a carnival.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{so what am i supposed to do in the meantime?}

<D>__{go in and talk to her. it can't hurt.}
