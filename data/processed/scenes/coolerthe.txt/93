<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it smells wrong. i'm shutting him down. he's not leaving here with a dime }
<A>__{shelly suddenly jabs larry in the throat with the tips of his fingers. larry gasps, starts to cave. shelly keeps him upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. nicky and marty looking on in amazement.}
