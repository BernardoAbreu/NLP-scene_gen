<C>__{liz}
<D>__{no, that was the problem. i couldn't get pregnant.}

<A>__{the dotted lines on the road are now solid.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's too late!}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{no it's not!}
<A>__{cris grabs the steering wheel and jerks it to the right, sending them over some speed bumps onto the off ramp.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{let go! are you out of your mind?!}
<A>__{she slams on the brakes and they screech to a stop on the right shoulder of the exit ramp.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{cris scrambles for an explanation. looks, sees a quieu of brake lights from the roadblock now backed up past the exit.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{traffic was piling up. you didn't see it?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{get out!!}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{we could'a been stuck there for hours.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i don't give a flyin' goddamn! you don't grab the steering wheel!}
<A>__{cris pauses for a beat. takes a different tack.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{you're right. i'm sorry. i panicked. i get phobic sitting in traffic. it won't happen again, i promise.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{damn straight, cause you won't be in the car!}
<A>__{she waits for him to exit.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{how `bout at the next gas station? please. i will fill up your tank.}
<A>__{liz sighs, exasperated, and continues down the exit ramp, passing a sign that says, welcome to california. exterior road block night cavanaugh and ferris drink coffee as troopers examine every passing vehicle.}
<D>__{ferris you're wasting time here. cavanaugh how long have you been in law enforcement? about six months?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{long enough to know we're not gonna catch him by surprise.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{what, you think he's got some kind of radar?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{interesting idea. it'd explain a whole lot.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{and area 51 would explain my missing tennis shoes. but that doesn't mean they're on a flying saucer.}
<A>__{ferris comes to a decision.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{in this case, it does.}
<A>__{cavanaugh knows he's about to hear something wild. exterior gas station mini mart night gasoline flowing. liz, still in a snit, sits impatiently behind the wheel, watching in the mirror as cris crosses behind the car and knocks on her window. grudgingly, she lowers it. he holds out a lottery card.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i am really really really really sorry.}
<A>__{indulging him, she takes it. when he walks away, she deigns to look at it. she tries to resist but can't. gets out a nickel and scratches the card. wins $250. what the...? chunk. the pump shuts off.}
<B>__{behind the car}
<A>__{cris takes out the nozzle and twists on the cap. behind him, liz strides by in a huff.}
<D>__{liz get in the car. i will be back in a minute.}
<A>__{cris smiles to himself as she proceeds toward the mini mart. exterior roadblock night cavanaugh considers what ferris has just told him.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{i'd call your proof a little iffy.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{look, from your own experience, this guy can't be punched, shot, surprised, captured, or confined. so either he's got something special, or you're an idiot.}
<A>__{cavanaugh doesn't like her logic.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{let's say i'm not an idiot...}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{and i'm not saying you are.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{we've got to think like he does. we've got to think ahead.}
