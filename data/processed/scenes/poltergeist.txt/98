<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{lesh goes to the console tv and, assuming everyone is asleep, she turns it off. in a very small voice diane leans on her elbow.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{please. leave it on.}
<A>__{dr. lesh smiles, it’s the first time we’ve seen her do this and it reminds diane at once of her favorite story book grandma who bakes cookies and knits comforters. close diane she smiles back and motions for dr. lesh to come over.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{when things get quiet like now i can imagine how all this must look from you end. i’m really embarrassed.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{oh, nonsense. i’ll tell you what is embarrassing. my being here with you nice people. parapsychology isn’t something you master in. there are no certificates of graduation, no license to practice. i’m a professional psychologist who spends most of her time engaged in this ghostly hobby, which makes me, i suppose, the most irresponsible sixty one year old woman i know.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you were so funny. your hands were shaking a mile a minute.}
<A>__{diane starts to giggle. it’s a release and dr. lesh joins her.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{it isn’t over. i’m perfectly terrified. it’s all these things we don’t understand. i feel like the protohuman, stepping of the forest primeval and seeing the moon for the first time. throwing rocks at it.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you mean someday we’ll understand these things?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{when it’s recognized for what it is. as any science. understanding and sponsorship seem always to be one hundred years behind ridicule and doubt. out of this experience, should we capture a high resolution photograph of a genuine manifestation time magazine will still put president reagan on its next cover.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{if i got killed would i come back as a ghost and get stuck in the house like my sister?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{your sister isn’t dead, robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{if i got killed could i visit her and show her how to get back here if you tied a rope around me and held it tight? then somebody could come get me and we could move somewhere else?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{some people believe that when you die your soul goes to heaven.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{when grampa was dead i looked at him on the hospital bed and i was watchin’, but nothing went out of him.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{his soul was invisible. you couldn’t see it going to the sky.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{how come grandpa isn’t on television with carol anne?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{some people believe that when you die there is a wonderful light.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{as bright as the sun but it doesn’t hurt to look into it. all the answers to all the questions you want to know are inside that light. and when you walk into it... you become a part of it forever. now, some people die, but they don’t know they’re gone.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{they think they’re still alive?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{that’s right. maybe they didn’t want to die. maybe they weren’t ready. maybe they hadn’t begun to live yet or lived a long, long time anyway, but wanted more life. they resist going into the light no matter how hard the light wants them. they hang around, watch tv, watch their friends grow up, feeling all unhappy or jealous and those feelings are bad, they hurt. and then some people just get lost on the way to the light. they need someone to lead them there.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{so some people get angry and throw things around like in my bedroom.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{yes. just like in school. there are people who are nice to you. and people who are mean.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i got beat up once by three kids. they took my lunch money. maybe they got hit by a truck and are upstairs right now.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{let’s get some shuteye, whad’ya say, partner?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{goodnight, mom. ‘nite lady. ‘nite, dad. ‘nite, e. buzz.}
<A>__{robbie puts his head down on the pillow and diane and dr. lesh share a warm look over him. robbie sits back up suddenly and looks at the tv set.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{‘nite, carol anne.}
