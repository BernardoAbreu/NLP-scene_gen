(t shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). in begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. sick boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. renton's litany continues over the action:}
