<A>__{the group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. camie and the fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there they are!}
<A>__{biggs takes the binoculars from luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. through the binoculars biggs sees two small silver specks.}

<D>__{that's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! probably a freighter tanker refueling.}

<D>__{but there was a lot of firing earlier...}

<D>__{hey, easy with those...}
<C>__{camie}
<D>__{don't worry about it, wormie.}
<A>__{the fixer gives luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.}
<C>__{fixer}
