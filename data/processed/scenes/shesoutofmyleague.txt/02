<L>__{interior airport security check point day}
<A>__{the agents take their places, manning the screening equipment. we push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk through metal detector. this is kirk kettner. he is not a looker. his uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind. the scruffy agent is stainer. he stands at the x ray monitor. as the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands kirk a flyer.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirk, bro. tonight?}
<A>__{insert: the flyer reads, "wheel in the sky a tribute to journey at club vertigo every tuesday night!" stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.}

<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, you never come see us anymore. it's been like four months. time to forget about marnie and get back on the whores.}
<A>__{stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable. fuller shoots a stern look from his office.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's not that. it's my grandma. i will probably be at the hospital for the next few nights.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh, shit. i spaced that. how's she doing?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{she's hanging in there but it doesn't look good.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, i'm sorry. she's a great lady. that sucks.}
<A>__{a middle eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. mr. fuller appears behind kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the arab. kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.}
