<L>__{exterior porch of bates' motel (night)}
<A>__{mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention. she stands a few moments, waiting. no one comes. impatience and anger rise in mary. she dashes out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, begins to honk the horn. after a moment, a young man open the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. after a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house. mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the porch. as she runs, we see that the young man has gone back only to get an umbrella. seeing that mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand. he gets to the porch a moment after mary has reached it. he stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand, then back to her. there is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look. mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him almost smile. he gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her. she goes into the office.}
