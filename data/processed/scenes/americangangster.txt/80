<A>__{richie's changing into his street clothes.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{but it's federal. i'd have to answer to who? fbi?}
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{me and the u.s. attorney. no one else. no fbi. hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. too much temptation for the feeble minded.}
<A>__{though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. toback levels with him }
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you know why i don't have it.}
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{doesn't matter.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{no, they're all on the take and i'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.}
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{it's fucked up. you're right. maybe this's an opportunity away from all that.}
<A>__{they regard each other. eventually }
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i will do it, but only like this: i don't set foot in a police station again. i work out of a place of my own. and i pick my own guys. guys i know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk.}
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{done.}
