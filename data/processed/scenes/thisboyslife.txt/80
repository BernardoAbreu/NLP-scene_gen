<L>__{interior skipper and toby's room evening}
<A>__{a worried toby sits dreading dwight's arrival. behind him, on the wall, toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the scout magazine: so that, above toby's head are the words boy's life fifteen times. there is a murmur of voices, and footsteps coming toward toby. toby expects the worst. but, surprisingly, dwight is beaming.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{who won?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{uh, well, uh... he's the one can't see out of one eye.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{hot damn! you actually gave little lord gayle a black eye?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, it wasn't black yet.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{but it was all puffed up?}
<P>__{(as toby nods)}
<D>__{then it was a shiner.}
<A>__{dwight sits down next to toby, eager for details.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{how'd it start?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i called him a sissy.}
<A>__{dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander. that boy fights for the pink team. did you make him cry?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well... he was just ready to. i called him a big assed, squat to pee sissy.}
<P>__{(as dwight slaps his leg again)}
<D>__{i'd have won bigger except he hit me when i wasn't looking.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{he dry gulched you. now that's your fault. you gotta keep your guard up. there's no excuse for getting dry gulched. i will show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave miss arthur gayle wondering what month it is.}
