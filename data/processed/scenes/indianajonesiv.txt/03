<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{a bedroom. deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient furniture and a large canopy bed. everything in the room is caked with dust and cobwebs...save for the burning candle. it rests on the windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. it bathes the room in orange light. indiana walks toward the candle. arm outstreched, he prepares to lift it. the policeman watch. shivering. silent. tightly gripping their pistols. indy's fingers are inches from the candlestick. suddenly... there is a loud whoosh! the candle goes out! indiana drops his flashlight. there is total darkness. we hear the distant, manical laugh of a man. it echoes through the castle. indy retrieves the flashlight, clicking it back on. the candle has disappeared! the laugh has sobsided. macgowan looks at his men. a troobled look covers the inspector's face. macgowan's eyes dart about the room. hennesy is gone!}

<A>__{the soond of a bell! a thick, dull ringing! in the distance! it sends a chill through the men. indiana darts out of the room. following the sound. the policemen are right behind him.}
