<L>__{exterior vivian's apartment building day}
<A>__{vivian comes out onto the fire escape. she stares in wonder. a snow white limo comes up the street. a necktie has been tied to the antennae like a knight's token. the music from la boheme is blaring from the car's stereo. edward is standing on the car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof. the wind blows at his hair. he is smiling. everywhere on the street people are staring; the bums, the pushers, the passerby's, the tourists. vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. the car comes to a stop in front of the vivian's building. vivian's landlord comes out the front door. his eyes go wide in disbelief. edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof. he leaps nimbly to the ground. he crosses to the entrance of the alleyway, looking up at vivian on the fire escape.}

<D>__{you are really lost this time.}
<A>__{edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her. with a sudden cry of joy, vivian comes down the fire escape. she stops at the bottom stair. edward comes forward and sweeps her into his arms. they kiss. he carries her to the limo as if she's weightless. her feet never touch the ground. the car door closes behind them. the limo drives away. the people of the street watch it go.}
