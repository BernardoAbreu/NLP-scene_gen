<A>__{closeup louis taking a hit off melanie's bong. louis and melanie are back in the living room, kicking back, taking bong hits. as louis gets his hit, melanie talks;}
<C>__{melani}
<D>__{... so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. piss the wrong person off, you get shot. so he says, fuck that moves over to guns. you can sell guns wherever there's a demand. no one gives a shit. he acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{he moves his lips when he reads, what does that tell ya. let's say he's streetwise. i will give 'im that. he's still a fuck up.}
