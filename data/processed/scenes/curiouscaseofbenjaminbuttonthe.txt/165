<L>__{exterior a new orleans park night}
<A>__{we see benjamin and daisy, their silhouettes walking through the park... she puts her arm around his shoulder... being close to him...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i have to go back tomorrow... i wish i could stay...}
<A>__{they reach a gazebo... not a soul around... they stand for a moment in the silence...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{in new york we stay up all night... i eat breakfast in a diner on houston with red booths and watch the sun come up over the buildings... there's always something to do...}
<A>__{which is in stark contrast to benjamin's life... daisy, takes off her shoes...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{dancers... don't need costumes or scenery.}
<A>__{and showing him what she's been telling him about, she does a dance for him...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i could imagine dancing completely naked...}
<A>__{daisy, dancing for him... while she dances...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{have you read "d.h. lawrence," his books were banned... the words are like making love....}
<A>__{he stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she moves closer to him... she comes next to him and she kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a different tact...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{in our group... you have to trust people... not be afraid... sex... is a big part of it... a lot of the dancers... are lesbians... a woman wanted me to sleep with her....}
<A>__{he's quiet.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{does that upset you?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{which part?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{that someone wanted to sleep with me.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{people should want to sleep with you... you're very desirable...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{let's go back to the house... or get a room somewhere... we can put down your coat...}
<A>__{she takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the park... there's nothing he'd like more... but...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{it's not that i don't want to... i just can't... not tonight....its just not...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i'm old enough.}
<A>__{and despite how available she is, how desirable she is...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{go back to new york, daisy... be with the people you are so fond of... you can only be young once...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{do you think you are too old for me... i've been with older men...}
<A>__{and when he still doesn't respond... daisy, rejected, takes up her shoes... and she starts off... benjamin coming beside her... but they're not really walking together anymore... and the time for them, this time, has gone away...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{you only get so many chances to be with someone... i let her go... and i missed it...}
