<L>__{interior master epps's plantation slave shack night}
<A>__{the slaves are sleeping. there is a loud commotion. epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get up! get up, we dance tonight! we will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness. get up.}
<L>__{interior master epps's plantation main house night}
<A>__{despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and now fully dressed. they take up position in the middle of the floor. they wait, poised like actors. solomon strikes up a tune; henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance. they do so very wearily. the whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure. epps, whip in hand:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{where's yah merriment? move yer feet.}
<A>__{as the slaves twirl about epps keeps an attentive eye on patsey. it should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view patsey twirl about the floor. this fact is not lost on mistress epps. a few moments of epps's lust on display is all that the mistress can bear. jealousy mounting, she snatches up a carafe. with all her might she throws it at patsey. it hits patsey square in the face. too thick to shatter, it leaves her bloody and writhing on the floor. the dancing, the music stop. the slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the mistress. mistress epps, screaming like a hellion:}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{sell her!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{c'mon, now. wha's this?}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{you will sell the negress!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're talkin' foolish. sell little pats? she pick with more vigor than any other nigger! choose another ta go.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{no other. sell her!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i will not!}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{you will remove that black bitch from this property, 'er i will take myself back to cheneyville.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{back to that hog's trough where i found you? oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me. do not set yourself up against patsey, my dear. that's a wager on which you will not profit. calm yerself. and settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got. or, go. 'cause i will rid myself of yah well before i do away with her!}
<A>__{mistress epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do. eventually, optionless, she storms away. for a few beats there is only the sound of patsey sobbing.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{that damned woman! i won't have my mood spoiled. i will not. dance!}
<A>__{epps sends the whip in solomon's direction. solomon responds by playing. treach literally drags the prone patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face. the slaves, as ordered, return to dancing.}
