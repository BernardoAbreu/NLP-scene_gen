<L>__{interior scimitar observation lounge night}
<A>__{the away team materializes in the most striking location on shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge. it is a huge, empty chamber. no furniture. a simple reman mat on the floor is the only decoration. at the very top of the room there is a large, etched glass dome. it is very dark. they turn when shinzon speaks from the shadows:}
<C>__{shinzon }
<D>__{i hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{praetor shinzon?}
<A>__{shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair. the crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human. assuming that he was reman, they're surprised by this realization. shinzon just stares at picard through the darkness for a moment.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{captain picard... jean luc picard... i don't mean to stare, it's just well, you can't imagine how long i've been waiting for this moment. i always imagined you taller, isn't that odd?}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.}
<A>__{data scans him with a tricorder as:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and you're not as we imagined you.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{you are human.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{commander worf.}
<P>__{(he speaks in klingon)}
<D>__{i greet you as a valiant warrior... and as my brother.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(terse, in klingon)}
<D>__{i will save my greetings for a better brother.}
<A>__{shinzon laughs, maniacally.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{why have you asked for our presence here?}
<A>__{shinzon does not answer. he is staring deeply at deanna, moans softly.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{praetor?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i've never met a human woman.}
<A>__{he slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{i'm only half human.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{deanna troi of betazed. empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. all of this i knew... but i didn't know you were so beautiful.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{you seem very familiar with our personnel.}
<A>__{shinzon moves even closer to deanna, not taking his eyes from her.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i am, commander riker...}
<P>__{(to deanna)}
<D>__{... may i touch your hair?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{praetor, we've come to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance. if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation, i suggest you do so now.}
<A>__{shinzon continues to stare at deanna. it is strangely seductive. almost disquieting in its intensity. deanna handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{on the world i come from there's no light. no sun. beauty isn't important. i see now there's a world elsewhere.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{praetor shinzon. we're not here to discuss your lack of a social life.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(turning back to picard)}
<D>__{yes, i'm sorry, captain.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{there's so much we have to talk about.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i would be interested to know what we are talking about.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{unity, captain! tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. federation and romulan. human and vulcan and klingon and reman. i'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. we want peace.}
<A>__{picard and the others are stunned.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i want to end the centuries of mistrust. i want to be your ally, not your enemy. as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and the senate supports you?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{i have dissolved the senate.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and you're wondering why the scimitar is so well armed. is this the ship of a peacemaker? or a predator?}
<P>__{(picard is startled at}
<D>__{shinzon's choice of}
<P>__{words)}
<D>__{... but you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. above all, you're trying to decide if you can trust me.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. computer, raise lighting four levels.}
<A>__{lights shoot up around the room. for the first time the crew can see shinzon clearly. picard actually gasps when he sees shinzon's face. the rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{allow me to tell you a story that i hope will clarify my position. when i was very young i was stricken with an odd disease. i developed a hyper sensitivity to sound. the slightest whisper caused me agony...}
<A>__{picard watches him carefully. wary and strangely intense.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{no one knew what to do. finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalaft's syndrome. do you know of it, captain?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you know i do.}
<A>__{the crew is dumbfounded at picard's unusual reaction.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{then you know it's a very rare syndrome. genetic. all the male members of my family had it. eventually i was treated. now i can hear as well as you can, captain.}
<A>__{he steps toward picard who holds his ground.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i can see as well as you can. i can feel everything you feel.}
<P>__{(he stops right before picard)}
<D>__{in fact, i feel exactly what you feel. don't i, jean luc?}
<A>__{picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity. it is as if picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{do you trust me now?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we need to talk, just you and i.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{come to dinner on romulus tomorrow. just the two of us. or just the one of us.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you know i need to verify this.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the crew is utterly confused. their confusion turns to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood. he hands the knife to data.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{tomorrow then, captain. we have so much to discuss.}
<A>__{picard touches his communicator pin:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{picard to enterprise. five to beam out.}
<A>__{they dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating shinzon's features. picard's eyes never leave shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him.}
