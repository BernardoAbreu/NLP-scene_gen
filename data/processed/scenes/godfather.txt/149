<A>__{sonny extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth. a car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the car blocking him. the windows of his car are shot out. bullet holes puncture the doors of his car. his hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car. his arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the assassins cannot take a chance that he will survive it. suddenly, he lets out an enormous roar, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, under fire. his face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground. a full shot...as the assassins scramble for their cars and make off in the distance. sonny's bodyguards stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late.}
