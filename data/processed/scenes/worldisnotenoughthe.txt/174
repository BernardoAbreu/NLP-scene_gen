<D>__{faster! get our speed up!}
<A>__{christmas presses forward...bond turns, his feet out toward the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer... bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact. he cushions the blow with his feet. both rigs moving together now, he climbs onto the bomb rig...puts out a hand, helps christmas across. the bomb sits there, daunting, deadly.}
