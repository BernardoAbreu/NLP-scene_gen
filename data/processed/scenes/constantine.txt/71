<L>__{exterior 20 lanes bowling alley night}
<A>__{cars are lined all the way down the street. angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her. it's joined by another in the trees both closing in with each step.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{detective!}
<A>__{angela looks back, sees john in the street.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how open is your mind?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer, continues walking. what she doesn't see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. but john does. he starts walking toward her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{do you believe in heaven and hell?}
<P>__{(off no answer)}
<D>__{how about what comes out of each?}
<A>__{angela keeps walking. he catches up with her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you mean like angels?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and demons.}
<A>__{angela stares at him, continues walking. he keeps up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{see, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work.}
<A>__{they walk together down the lonely street.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look, i see terrible things every day. a mother drowns her baby. a ten year old shoots his father. but it's not demons, it's the evil that men do.}
<A>__{behind them, a streetlight blinks out. then another. they're not looking back so they don't see it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy.}
<A>__{another light fizzes, blinks out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i don't believe in demons.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you should. they believe in us.}
<A>__{they pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then blacks out. both look up. the next lamp flares then fizzes out. angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them. she looks to john. but he's staring straight ahead. because now the light in front of them is flaring}
<B>__{bright.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we should go...}
<A>__{second later it blinks off. john grabs her hand }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fast.}
<A>__{angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural wind races toward them. john jerks her into action. they run towards the next light. it blinks out right when they reach it. they race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly lit statue of the good shepherd.}
