<A>__{lursa and b'etor are watching the monitor of geordi's pov with irritated expressions. on the monitor, geordi rounds a corner and enters engineering. the sisters lean forward eagerly.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{finally!}

<A>__{geordi is talking to an engineer named farrell, n.d.s working in b.g. mid conversation.}
<C>__{farrell}
<D>__{i'd like to run a level three diagnostic on the port plasma relays. i think one of the generators is fluctuating.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{okay, let's do it.}
<A>__{they both move to consoles...}

<A>__{as before. on the screen, we can now see several of the monitors in engineering. on the left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of the enterprise. lursa suddenly reacts to something on the screen.}
<C>__{lursa}
<D>__{that's it!}
<P>__{(to b'etor)}
<D>__{replay from time index four two nine.}
<A>__{b'etor works. the image on their monitor runs backward for a moment and then freezes. on the screen, we can see several of the monitors in engineering. on the left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of the enterprise. lursa touches the diagram.}
<C>__{lursa}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{magnify this section and enhance.}
<A>__{b'etor works. the picture zooms in on the cut a way graphic and sharpens in focus. there are several blocks of numbers and text visible. lursa studies the image.}
<C>__{lursa}
<D>__{their shields are operating on a modulation of two five seven point four...}
<A>__{the sisters exchange an excited glance, then move toward the command area.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{adjust our torpedo frequency to match two five seven point four!}
<A>__{the two sisters smile eagerly.}
