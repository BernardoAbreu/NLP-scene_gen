<L>__{ext: jamestown clubland, street night}
<A>__{we see a figure exiting the subway. this time it is lilly, following the same path that steph took. making her way through the crowded street. the rain has given way to a fine mist. then, as lilly moves forward she senses something; that feeling again, that she is being watched. she stands for a moment as people push past, looks up at the gothic victorian buildings that loom out of the drifting mist. but there is nothing. lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist, casting glances at the odd passerby. then, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular, taller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who stands out. he is immediately suspicious to lilly. he is slowly moving through the crowd towards her. from under the hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's eyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. the man now puts his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something. lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a cold hard presence in her hand. she stares ahead at the approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into a pedestrian. lilly continues forward, closer, closer. from under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead catches hers for a moment. the man now begins to approach her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for something. a gun. lilly immediately pulls her gun. the mist beads on the shining barrel of her gun. the man is raising his hand towards her.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{police. put your hands where i can see them!}
<A>__{the man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards lilly, her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the man looms closer. and then he is gone. cut to the man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping at the hands that now threaten to throttle him. and we see silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only the second time, we see anger in silus' eyes. people in the street scatter as more brothers emerge with guns pointed. and lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man silus is holding. on the ground, next to the man, she sees what he had in his hand. a pamphlet. asking people to come to church service; a picture of a brother priest serenely beaming out from it. meanwhile the man that silus has is gagging on the ground, silus' hand still on his throat. he's begging.}
<C>__{parishoner}
<D>__{holy brother, please...}
<A>__{lilly grabs silus' shoulder.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{let him go.}
<A>__{she shows silus the pamphlet.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's harmless. let him go.}
<A>__{the man now pulls back his hood. he is black, his large, watery eyes stare up in awe at silus. he grabs silus' hand which now relaxes and draws silus' ring to his lips, kissing it, in tears.}
<C>__{parishoner}
<D>__{forgive me. i've offended you...}
<A>__{we see silus' dark stare. a beat. then silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no. you are divine. it is the world that offends me.}
<A>__{silus rises, the parishioner just lays there in awe. silus now turns to lilly who is on his shoulder. and now lilly realizes for the first time that it is silus.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{brother silus. what's going on?}
<A>__{we then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the rain. the door opens and jones emerges, taking in both lilly and silus. a grim smile of realization comes to jones' face. he pulls something from his jacket. cut to}
