<L>__{exterior the lifeboat the raft day}
<A>__{the sun is high. pi raises the adjustable canopy he has rigged on his raft and sits beneath it. he feels the wind on his face and watches richard parker lounge in the stern of the lifeboat. pi smiles, for a moment genuinely happy. he uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which are covered with journal entries... `life is good' montage pi's raft has transformed again. fish strips dry on lines; he has fashioned new tools, rigged an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells, and a collapsible shade umbrella. pi trims his fingernails, a fish bone toothpick in his mouth.}
<P>__{pi (writing v.o.)}
<D>__{i never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. that a pile of tools a bucket, a knife, a pencil might become my greatest treasures. or that knowing richard parker was here might ever bring me peace. in times like these, i remember that he has as little experience of the real world as i do. we were both raised in a zoo by the same master. now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. without richard parker, i would have died by now. my fear of him keeps me alert. tending to his needs gives my life purpose.}
