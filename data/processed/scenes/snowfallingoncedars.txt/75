<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{dr. sterling whitman sits in his expensive suit, a giant of a man whose towering frame ill fits the witness box. his eyes are small and blue, and carry the weight of superiority with practiced ease.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. it was human , yes? type b positive.}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{carl heine's type.}
<A>__{nels nodding. seemingly unconcerned by this fact.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{no, but as i say, the type is rare. ten percent of caucasian males.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and the blood could not have belonged to defendant. seeing that his type is o negative.}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{that's obvious.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff. where a fella's hand goes. and what did you see under your microscope, besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings...?}
<A>__{and the witness stops. a curious question. but nels is waiting. with an expectant smile.}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{bits of blood and wood. what else would there be?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull...}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{i'm a hemotologist, sir, i was asked only t...}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{...would that seem logical ?}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you don't.}
<A>__{nels lifts the gaff off the table. looks at it.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{the coroner testified that carl heine had a cut. a fresh cut. probably one or two hours old.}
<A>__{and grasps the butt end. of the gaff.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{on the palm. of his right hand.}
<A>__{walks, dragging one leg just slightly, toward the box. and holding the butt of the gaff toward him...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{with no bone or scalp or hair present. would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{i'm a hemotologist, not a detective.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{...or from the cut on his hand. which is more probable?}
<A>__{whitman won't be badgered. his smile carries only a trace of coldness...}
<C>__{dr. whitman}
<D>__{it is not my function. to weigh those probabilities.}
<A>__{nels looks him over.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{and turns his back. walks away.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{...that's the jury's job.}
