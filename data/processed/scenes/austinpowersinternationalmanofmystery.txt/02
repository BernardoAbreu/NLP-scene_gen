<L>__{exterior carnaby street day}
<A>__{music: soul bossanova by quincy jones. we start on a pair of beatle boots and peg top crushed velvet pants walking down the street in rhythm, a la saturday night fever. we pan up to reveal austin powers, international man of mystery. he's a swinger, with medium length mod hair and sideburns and he wears national health services glasses. austin walks along carnaby street taking photographs. it is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in sixties movies. austin, bursting with life, gives a two handed handshake to a mod freak, who's just gotten off a red double decker bus. austin salutes a strolling bobby, then comes across two beautiful mod girls who are excited to see him. they all start to twist to the music, including the bobby. freeze frame technicolor blue tint title card (production note: all title cards will be done in technicolor freeze frames a la sweet charity.) in the middle of the street, three models wait impatiently to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area. one wears a short skirted stewardess outfit. one wears a metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl. the other wears a see through mary quant dress.}
