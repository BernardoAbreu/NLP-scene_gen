<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty eight of "truman" and there can scarcely have been a more momentous week in the show's history. i'm your host, michael conners, and this is a special edition of "tru talk", the forum where we discuss and analyze recent events with the show's award winning creator and producer, christof.}
<P>__{(referring to the image of truman in the background)}
<D>__{i remind viewers that as this is a living history, it is our practise to keep the image of truman on screen at all times.}
<P>__{(turning to christof)}
<D>__{welcome.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{before we start taking calls, the huge surge in ratings over the last few days, how do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{ratings have never been our primary goal. i imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing truman's latest torment. however i'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{but recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. what keeps us watching one man twenty four hours a day eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{it has to be the reality.}
<A>__{during this segment, we cut to a cross section of viewers the nightwatchmen, the two old women on their sofa, the barman and the waitress listening to christof's theories on their viewing habits.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{we've become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. while the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about truman himself. no scripts. no cue cards. it's not always shakespeare but it's genuine. that's how he can support an entire channel.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{a window onto the human condition?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{i prefer to think of it as a mirror.}
<A>__{not only}
<D>__{does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{let's go to some of those viewers' calls.}
<A>__{the interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his desk's high tech phone terminal.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<P>__{(into speaker phone)}
<D>__{charlotte, north carolina, for christof.}
<C>__{male caller 1 }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{you're on, caller. go ahead.}
<C>__{male caller 1}
<D>__{christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{male caller 1}
<D>__{truman has never been closer. the way he looked directly at us, spoke to us for the first time. do you think he'll ever work it out?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{i don't believe so. not now. he tested his world, as we all do at certain times, and eventually it passed the test. you have to understand, he is a man made for tv, the world he occupies his only frame of reference. no, for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts.}
<A>__{the interviewer presses another line on his terminal.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{sacramento, california, you're on "tru talk".}
<C>__{male caller 2 }
<D>__{how much of a strain has the last few days placed on the actors?}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{working on "truman" has always been a huge commitment for an actor, not just in terms of separation from friends and family, but since truman essentially drives the plot, it's a never ending improvisation. recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<P>__{(cutting off the call)}
<D>__{of course truman has always been very much in on casting.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{as with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<P>__{(pressing another line)}
<D>__{istanbul, turkey, you're on with world renowned videographer, christof.}
<C>__{male caller 3 }
<D>__{christof. i've admired your work my whole life, although i can't say i've seen it all.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{who can?}
<C>__{male caller 3}
<D>__{can you settle an argument for me? what's the longest time truman has been off camera?}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(trace of pride)}
<D>__{in his entire life, forty two minutes. a technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time. the remainder generally results from blindspots, in the early days, when truman would stray out of range of our cameras.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{the hague for christof...the hague?...lost them.}
<P>__{(pressing another line)}
<D>__{amagansett, long island, you're on "tru talk".}
<C>__{female caller 1 }
<D>__{how can you say truman lives a life like any other?}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(sensing the thinly disguised resentinent in the caller's voice)}
<D>__{i believe that to be so. i often feel the only difference between truman's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented. we all play our allotted roles }
<C>__{female caller 1 }
<D>__{ he's not a performer. he's a prisoner.}
<A>__{the interviewer goes to cut off the call but christof holds him back.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(rising to the challenge)}
<D>__{ he can leave at any time. if his was more than just a vague ambition, if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him. i think what really distresses you, caller, is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell" }
<C>__{female caller 1}
<P>__{(as if trying to convince herself. giving herself away)}
<D>__{ no, you're wrong! he'll prove you wrong! he can still do it!}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(a thought occurring, looking directly into camera)}
<D>__{do i know you, caller? your voice sounds familiar.}
