<L>__{exterior dock on jacques}
<A>__{at the end of the dock, jacques who is sitting on the edge of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of gloves on. he then grabs the handles of a strange machine which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely elsewhere.}
<B>__{back in lab}
<A>__{johana watches jacques. she just can't believe her eyes. lawrence is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with different switches.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(to johana)}
<D>__{you should get things moving, you know. we're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! frank, check the program!}
<A>__{johana is finally able to speak.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{who... who is that?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{mayol... jacques mayol.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{that's the experiment? dumping a guy into a frozen lake?}
<A>__{lawrence turns one last knob.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse. we weren't able to save the equipment.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i will have to talk to the driver.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{in the spring when he melts!}
<A>__{johana walks closer to the window. she isn't hearing a thing he's saying. jacques is putting on his flippers. johana can't believe it. jacques is standing by a hole cut in the ice. he is holding onto the machine in the water. he is waving a mask.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{you really send him under the ice? he isn't a slave or a convict or anything?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{my dear, science is a cruel mistress.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{but... how is he going to breathe?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{he isn't going to breathe.}
<A>__{jacques takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water. lawrence sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches. johana grabs his arm as if they could do something about it.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{listen...}
<A>__{he raises the volume: we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{that's his heartbeat.}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible.}
<A>__{lawrence tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to johana. johana feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out. underwater jacques jacques stops his machine by turning one of the handles. he's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake. he swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is hinged open. he closes it around himself. his heart is still slowing down. he pushes a button on the machine, and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him. back in lab on video screen we see a moving x ray image.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{he's in the fluoroscope now. listen to his heart. impressive, huh? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. it's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{how long can he stay down? without breathing?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{it depends. he should come up soon.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{unless he's decided to stay for the night.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{why is he doing this?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{for one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, i wish i knew.}
<A>__{johana sighs with relief as jacques appears at the surface in one big breath.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(smiling at frank)}
<D>__{coffee might be nice.}
<A>__{she heads towards the old peruvian and pours a cup of coffee...}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(afterthought)}
<D>__{will he understand spanish?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{his mother's an american. he spent half of his life in the states. i'd try english if i were you.}
