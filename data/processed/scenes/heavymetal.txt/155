<A>__{den reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear. he kicks the other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear with all his might into the head of the stone idol. in the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky, striking the idol full force. the lightning bolt travels through the spear and down the chain, into the water. suddenly, the electrical energy arcs across to join with the loc nar. holding onto the loc nar, ard and the queen begin to glow green, then de materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp. the troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all that remains is the glowing loc nar, hanging in mid air.}

<A>__{in a single powerful leap, den, carrying katherine, bounds up onto the queen's flying lizard and they fly off. the amazed troops watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.}
