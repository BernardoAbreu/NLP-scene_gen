<L>__{exterior pond day (bit later)}
<A>__{sharon is already unpacking their lunch as catch trudges up and collapses near a stream fed pond. she hands him a sandwich, but he shakes his head.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no thanks. i can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time.}
<A>__{she smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and catch notices.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{as soon as you get happy, you get sad.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm okay. everything's code four.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{everything's what?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{everything's fine.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{fine? this isn't fine. i know fine. this is something else. something happened yesterday.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yesterday you mean you want to hear about it?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{sure i do.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{no kidding. why? you never talk about yesterday.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{all my days are the same.}
<A>__{he keeps staring, waiting. she is chewing a sandwich, looking at him. finally, she begins with no emotion.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yesterday. okay. yesterday we rolled on a 415. juliette and sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were h.d.b. and definitely unco op. it got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and robby got a sprained wrist, so i did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a d.b. in sunset park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and i usually do all right but the smell got to me, and i can still smell her. then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and i carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and i wanted to punch her rock head mother, and then shift ended and i had a nice visit with my brother larry.}
<A>__{he is staring at her. he takes her hands, holds them.}
<C>__{catch}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that would make anybody sad.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{sorry you asked?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. no, you can always tell me.}
<A>__{she stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't pick up on.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{well... i feel better now. you feel better?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i feel fine. great.}
<A>__{he takes off his t shirt and begins stripping off his shorts, his underwear!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{she is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond, her darkness dissipating.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{catch! there's no swimming here! and you can't be naked in a state park!}
<A>__{he dives under and surfaces again.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{take the day off, pogo!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what if a park ranger comes?!}
<A>__{he dives and surfaces once more. we stay close on him.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{take your badge off for once. don't be such a damn marine about everything. just...}
<A>__{he stops because she isn't there. he looks about. then suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above him, in her underwear about to dive! he yelps and gets out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic, near professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive. she hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed play. at one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches her. they are in chest deep water and their faces are close. they pause then she goes in for a kiss, but he pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{someplace i've never been kissed.}
<A>__{she smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his face. then she moves away. he opens his eyes. she walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look. catch comes to the shore to dry himself, but as he dresses, sharon glances at his body and the scarring on his chest and arms. he is troubled about this, avoiding her eyes. then he makes a decision.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{they tell me i was in an accident. long time ago.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{looks like a bad one.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i don't remember it. i...}
<A>__{she waits but he says no more. she continues to dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear but before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back to take off her wet bra. he glances at her. she looks over and catches him glancing. they both smile softly, ironically, as they finish dressing.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{we should be thinking about lunch. we have to pack up.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{so soon?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{some of us have to work.}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{you ever work?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{yeah. i worked.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh? you remember that? working?}
<A>__{she smiles and walks off toward the food. he stares after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory, as he dresses.}
