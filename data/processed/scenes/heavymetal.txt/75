<B>__{the pilot}
<A>__{he has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness. he looks around incredulously. the island is a junkyard a veritable graveyard of aircrafts. there are many aircrafts, both old wrecks and futuristic looking ones lying everywhere. skeletal corpses are still left in some of the wrecks. the camera pans to the remains of one machine. it is an old american lockheed electra. it glints dull in the half light of dawn. painted on its side are two names; "amelia earhart" and "fred noonan". the camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of a pile of scrap. tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile. the metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to lift it up. wwe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball. the camera pulls back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to austin grimaldi, who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his needlenose pliers.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine, he begins to re solder it in place. behind him, a little girl with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{it's broken again, isn't it daddy?}
<C>__{austin}
<P>__{(concentrating)}
<D>__{yes dear. but daddy's fixing}
<P>__{it. (hums)}
<C>__{little girl}
<P>__{(watching)}
<D>__{how come it's always breaking?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i don't know, sweetheart. mmmmhmm.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{when it's fixed, will you make more funny pictures for me?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{honey, why don't you go play with your toys and let daddy finish his work, okay? mmmm ...}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the little girl wanders around to the other side of the machine, as austin flips a switch. once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up. austin uses a tool to fine tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize; the glass gates of kraan. as the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer to the holograph screen.}
