<A>__{bree comes out of door goes down steps hesitates in front of klute's apartment struggling with the question of whether to knock. camera pulls back to reveal we are watching her through the windshield of a car in the parking lot across the street. camera pulls back further to reveal the back of cable's head as he sits in the car watching her. bree starts to knock on klute's door but stops herself and walks down the street. cable's head moves out of the shot. we hear the sound of the car door opening and closing. through the windshield we see cable cross in front of the car and start to follow bree down the street.}
