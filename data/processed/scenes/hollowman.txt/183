<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{sarah exits the lab. checks the corridor. down at the end of the cramped tunnel is the supply room. she swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while glancing side to side and behind her.}
<L>__{interior supply room}
<A>__{spooked, sarah bursts into the room. she goes to the supply fridge freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts through blood bags.}
<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{matt and linda push along the corridor; matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando. a noise behind them. footsteps. matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. the white chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the tunnel. but it isn't a human shape. matt's uniform shreds. something with fierce sharp claws fells him. tearing into his flesh. we see a angry, hungry face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ahh! shit!}
<A>__{linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. matt trips and goes sprawling. something yelps. a howl. linda shoots. her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground. a moment of calm. as the dusty chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape appears, still twitching.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{karl three. nice shot.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's let the animals out. it wasn't him we were tracking.}
<A>__{linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq gun at the ready. the heat is getting to bar. bar scrubs are soaked, her hair's a mess. she wipes the sweat from her brow.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it won't kill me unless it gets infected. you?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{me .... don't ask about me. if he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so he could be anywhere right now.}
<A>__{matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud mist. nothing else appears.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to god frank can reprogram the elevator.}
