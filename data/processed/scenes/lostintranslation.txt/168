<A>__{bob finally finds the small restaurant. the automatic door opens for him, and charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby sushi chef, turns to bob happy to see him. he is disheveled from the rain and adorable. he sits down next to charlotte, she pours him a beer and orders for him.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you made it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{they really have to work on that street name thing.}
<A>__{a perky recording voice says "kornichiwa!" from his pocket.}

<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{he pulls a pink hello kitty watch from his pocket.}

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, she'll love it.}
<A>__{the sushi chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. charlotte takes a bite of a piece but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. bob makes fun of her gracelessness.}
