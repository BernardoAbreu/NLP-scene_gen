<A>__{the harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered ships. blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the choking black smoke those fires produce. every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher bearer, medic, iron worker. they fish men from the water, extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships. everyone is screaming and yelling the wounded for help, the helpers for more help. local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base swimming pool toward the burning ships. the photographer records this with his black and white film camera. he is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude of what he is recording the loss of america's innocence.}
