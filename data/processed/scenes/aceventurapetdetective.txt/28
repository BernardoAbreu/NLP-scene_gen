<L>__{exterior metro police department later that day}
<A>__{a flurry of activity in the detective division. as ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by the obnoxious, sergeant aguado.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{hey, ventura! make any good collars lately?}
<B>__{another cop}
<A>__{or were they leashes? they all bust up. aguado spots a bug on the ground.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<P>__{(steps on the bug)}
<D>__{homicide, ventura!}
<A>__{the cops are falling all over themselves laughing.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{how you gonna solve this one?!}
<A>__{ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{good question, aguado… first i'd establish a motive. in this case the killer saw the size of the bug's dick, and became insanely jealous.}
<A>__{the other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". aguado has no comeback. ace comes face to face with him.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{then i'd lose thirty pounds porking his wife.}
<A>__{aguado suddenly loses it and swings at ace. with a lightening move, ace sidesteps the punch and forces aguado's face down next to the dead bug.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{now kiss and make up.}
<A>__{ace walks off.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{llloooser!}
<A>__{ace walks to the desk of emilio echavez, a young energetic member of the homicide division. ace has a silly impish look on his face.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{i miss you.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{it's not a good time, ace. if einhorn sees me talking to you i'm gonna be history.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{okay. just tell me what you got on snowflake. that's all i need.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{…i can't say anything. my hands are tied.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(effeminate)}
<D>__{sounds like my kind of a party.}
<A>__{a cop comes to emilio's desk.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{look alive, einhorn's on her way}
<A>__{down.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{ace, please?!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{just tell me who's working the case?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{aguado.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{aguado?! he's pimple juice! he's the poster child for lead paint chip eaters!}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{look, ace. we're a little busy with murderers and drug dealers. a missing dolphin isn't exactly a high priority.}
<A>__{the elevator is getting closer.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{ace, gimme a break will ya?}
<A>__{ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.}
<C>__{emilio}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{okay, okay. we checked all the local animal rights groups, taxidermists, and we're running a check through dmv on all recent van rentals. so far, nada.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{any unusual bets being made?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{ace, it's the super bowl, of course there's bets being made.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{what'd you find out about the tank?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{nothing weird. just the tire tracks and the exit route. the guard didn't see anything.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{that's it. i swear. now please go away!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you know something?}
<P>__{(again impish)}
<D>__{you're nice!}
<A>__{ace gets up and exits the room. then just as emilio sighs with relief, ace pops back in.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{what about crazy philly fans?}
<A>__{the elevator bell rings. out steps police lt. lois einhorn, mid 30s, with a slender build, a great pair of legs and a bad tude.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{holy testicle tuesday!}
<C>__{einhorn}
<P>__{(to emilio)}
<D>__{what the hell is he doing here?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i came to confess. i was the second gunman on the grassy knoll.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{spare me the routine, ventura. i know you're working the snowflake case. may i suggest you yield to the experts on this one? we'll find the porpoise.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(mock relief)}
<D>__{whewww… now i feel better!}
<A>__{ace turns to go.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{of course, that might not do any good. you see, nobody's missing a porpoise. it's a dolphin that's been taken. the common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth, and a triangular thorasic fin, while the bottlenose dolphin, or tursiops truncatus, has an elongated beak, round, cone shaped teeth, and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage. (beat) but i'm sure you already knew that. (beat) that's what turns me on about you. hey… maybe i will give you a call sometime, lieutenant. your number still 911? alrighty then!}
<A>__{ace exits.}
