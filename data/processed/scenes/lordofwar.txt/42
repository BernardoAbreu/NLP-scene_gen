<L>__{interior warehouse barranquilla, colombia. day.}
<A>__{yuri, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and vitaly keep a watchful eye as the narc leader inspects crates of machine guns and other ammunition.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{the second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid. credit card, check, cash. preferably in advance, ideally to an off shore account. it's why i choose my customers so carefully. say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend to have a highly developed sense of order. they always pay their bills on time.}
<A>__{the narc leader nods his approval.}
<C>__{narc leader}
<P>__{(referring to yuri's wound)}
<D>__{i apologize for earlier.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(slight wince)}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{workers start loading the crates into a truck. the narc leader hands yuri the suitcase.}
<C>__{narc leader}
<D>__{it's all there.}
<A>__{yuri snaps open the suitcase inside six kilos of cocaine.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{narc leader}
<D>__{six keys of pure.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{i can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at chase manhattan.}
<C>__{narc leader}
<P>__{(hair trigger temper flaring again)}
<D>__{you should be thanking me.}
<P>__{(waving his cell phone)}
<D>__{have you checked the street price today? with the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i sell guns. i don't sell drugs.}
<C>__{narc leader}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{diversify.}
<A>__{the narc leader walks away.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{i've got standards.}
<A>__{the narc leader ignores him, climbs in his jeep and drives off. the truck, loaded with munitions, also exits. yuri and vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.}
<C>__{vitaly}
<P>__{(staring at their "remuneration")}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine. he takes a bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube. he goes to hand vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled his own. vitaly dips his tube into the coke snorts, keeps snorting a longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.}
