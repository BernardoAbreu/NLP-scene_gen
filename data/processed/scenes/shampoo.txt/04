<L>__{interior bank of america day}
<A>__{george sits talking, with mr. pettis, a bank vice president. he is perspiring a little. somebody's breathing rather heavily. it's mr. pettis seated behind his desk now and opposite george. he's going over something.}
<C>__{pettis}
<P>__{(looking up now)}

<D>__{great.}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{wonderful woman.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she is.}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{i went to school with her husband.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{pettis}

<D>__{right.}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{and you need money?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{right, that's right.}
<C>__{pettis}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you do know what money's like these days.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(no)}
<D>__{well, yeah... you know.}
<A>__{pettis grabs a sheet off his desk, one in plastic containing rates.}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{jesus, look at this. nine, nine and three quarters that's our prime rate. and i will tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they are?}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{after all, mr. roundy, we're paying six percent. six percent. fha's at eight and a half no, we won't be going back to the old days.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i guess not...}
<C>__{pettis}
<D>__{it's got nothing to do with inflation. rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable pause.}
<C>__{pettis }
<D>__{what sort of references do you have?}
