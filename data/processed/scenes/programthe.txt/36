<L>__{interior weight room night}
<A>__{joe, bud lite and bobby collins, all suffering from various aches and pains are getting naperson and analgesic balm out of the non prescription drug cabinet. joe pops a nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co ed camille schaeffer works a knee lift. camille's the perfect marriage of southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. joe leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how ya' doin'?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{little late to be workin' out, isn't it?}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(with a little edge)}
<D>__{only time i could get in here when the football team wasn't usin' it.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(trying to get a rise out of her)}
<D>__{well, if it wasn't for the football team, might not be a weight room to use. you tryin' to firm up a little, or what?}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{don't need to firm up. i'm strengthening my knee. had arthroscopic surgery.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{had my knee scoped once too. when you're finished here, maybe we could get a yogurt, compare scars.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{sorry, i don't date football players. they're all full of themselves. i saw you on the cover of sports illustrated, so you're probably worse than most.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that's real open minded of you. so you won't consider doin' anything with me?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well at least tell me what happened to your knee. what'd you do? fall outa your convertible?}
<A>__{camille stops her knee lift, turns to joe. we think she's going to fire on him. wrong.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you know, there's maybe one thing i'd do with you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{tennis. i will play tennis with you.}
<A>__{camille starts to walk away.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{tennis. you mean now? it's raining.}
