<A>__{open close on a candy wrapper opening. a hand removes the candy revealing an inspiring message printed inside the wrapper "when two hearts race, both win." on phillip. he's deeply touched by the sentiment as he chews on the candy. he puts the wrapper on the refrigerator with a magnet. he opens another. he chews and reads "commit random acts of kindness" again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator. he opens another and pops the candy in his mouth. he reads "a smile is a flower on your face" he's disgusted by the trite sentiment and throws the wrapper in the trash. a beat later, he removes the candy from his mouth and throws that in the trash too. just then steven walks by in a tuxedo, adjusting his tie.}
