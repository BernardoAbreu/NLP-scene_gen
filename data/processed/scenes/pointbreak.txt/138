<D>__{i will take that as a yes.}
<A>__{one by one they stabilize. falling face down, knees bent, they angle their hands and feet minutely to move laterally. utah flails, the last to trim out. but he's holding his own. grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive. he flares out and "flies" back to the others. rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on a separate plane of existence. a hurricane of wind. wild hooting. despite his terror, johnny has to grin at nathaniel, falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube in the pool.}

<D>__{ten thousand feet. let's do it.}
<A>__{the group stabilizes, moving together. first bodhi and roach link arms, trimming constantly. concentrating. nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and maneuvers toward them. he grabs roach's arm. grommet works his way next to nathaniel. locks in. they need utah to complete the ring. four faces beckoning to him, distorted by the hurricane wind.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{come on johnny. get in here!}
<A>__{johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily toward them. bodhi and grommet grab him. he's in. a perfect five man star.}

<D>__{relax, brah. i got you, i got you.}
<C>__{grommet}
<D>__{righteous ass speedstar, dudes!}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{you diggin' this?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{great! great!}
<A>__{johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought. screaming down through the dawn sky at 130. locked into the ring. part of something. connected to these guys far above the planet. less far every second... bodhi's chest altimeter reads}
