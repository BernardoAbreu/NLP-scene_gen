<L>__{exterior ancient computer system i o port}
<A>__{rush, krod and mega head deep into an obsolete, abandoned region of low rez circuitry.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{the old game grid is this way }
<A>__{he spins. rush and mega aren't behind him. they've climbed inside a defunct i o port: like a retro tech temple.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{how do i uplink to the real world?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{the real world doesn't exist. nobody can uplink. these ports were for simulation only.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{right... but how did those poor misguided fools boot up the link?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{they stood in the center. held their disk above their head.}
<A>__{rush pulls his disk off his back, aims it skyward. concentrates. energy flows off his feet, interacts with the i o port floor. ruby communication beam shoots skyward.}
