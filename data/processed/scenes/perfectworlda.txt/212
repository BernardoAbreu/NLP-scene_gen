<D>__{gawd that's beautiful.}
<A>__{butch spots phillip standing at the entrance to the living room with the bag. he takes it from the boy, empties the contents candy, cookies, bread, sugar and all and picks up the rope, takes mack's barlow knife from his pocket and cuts off a long shank. butch takes the rope and begins to tie up the three. phillip stands, stares, aware that something bad is happening. butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and walks over to the phonograph. he turns it back on. the scratchy record plays. he turns up the volume.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(to phillip)}
<D>__{you can go wait in the car or you can watch. yer' old enough to think for yer'self.}
<A>__{phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground. butch returns to his seat on the coffee table and stares at the three hostages. he appears as if he's about to cry, closes his eyes and rests his chin on the barrel of the revolver while he recites instructions...}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{shut yer' eyes, cleve. mack, you and lottie hold the boy tight. shut yer' eyes, too.}
<A>__{phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself. butch seems to be in another world now taken to another place and time. a slight smile finds its way to his face, then disappears.}
<C>__{lottie}
<D>__{please, mistah', ain't no use in it.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{we'll give you ever'thing we got!}

<P>__{(to mack cleve)}
<D>__{say it wif' me....}
<A>__{butch looks to phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape. phillip watches, not knowing what to do. the revolver cocked, resting on the floor.}
<D>__{mack, cleve & lottie giv' us this day our daily bread and forgiv' us, lawd, our trespasses as we forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us...}
<A>__{butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one. out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the .... pistol but it's not there... butch looks up to see... phillip teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it directly at butch. closeup butch his expression is blank then a slight smile. for a second it's as if none of this has happened, that butch will grasp phillip in his arms... a deafening gunblast turns his expression to blank. phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf. the mambo record comes to an end, but scratches on ad}
<B>__{infinitum.}
<A>__{butch falls back to his knees, still staring at phillip. he looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown red gushes through his t shirt, and back to the boy.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(as if he hasn't seen him in years)}
<D>__{phillip?....}
<A>__{phillip, momentarily dazed, stares at the gun in his hand, at butch, the blood pouring from butch's side, and the shocked faces of mack and his family. then, in a flash, he runs, pell mell, out of the house.}
