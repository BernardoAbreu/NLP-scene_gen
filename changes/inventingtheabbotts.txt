<LOC>__{EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY}
<ACTION>__{(LATE SPRING, 1957) OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. NEW ANGLE - TENT -- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley). Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year).}

<ACTION>__{Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.}

<ACTION>__{ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping- pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950 Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway. The garage doors are open and the garage light is on. We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.}

<ACTION>__{HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School.)}

<ACTION>__{Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent. Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac, caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.}
<LOC>__{INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand. Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor. They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy, waiting like predators for their chance to dance with Eleanor.}

<DIAL>__{I meant... just... we never get a chance to be together, alone, you know?}
<ACTION>__{STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.}
<LOC>__{INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG}
<ACTION>__{-- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.}
<CHAR>__{PAMELA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi. u                DOUG Hi.}

<CHAR>__{PAMELA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully.}
<CHAR>__{DOUG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So how come Alice's marrying him?}
<CHAR>__{PAMELA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with.}
<CHAR>__{DOUG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover.}
<CHAR>__{PAMELA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess.}
<LOC>__{INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)}
<ACTION>__{The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little.}
<CHAR>__{LLOYD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham.}
<ACTION>__{He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and AD-LIBBED toasts. The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT}

<LOC>__{EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)}
<ACTION>__{Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{(MINUTES LATER) As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain.}
