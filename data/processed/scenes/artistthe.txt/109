<L>__{interior peppy's house george's bedroom day}
<D>__{george is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. at first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. the chauffeur answers: title card: i work for miss miller now. george visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. it's as though something has come between them. the chauffeur places the screenplay on the bedside table. george seems to greet it with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm. the chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts on a plate for george. george doesn't want any, it's all too much... before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual reserve for the first time and says to george: title card: she's been good to you. she's always looked out for you. the chauffeur leaves without trying to convince george further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.}
