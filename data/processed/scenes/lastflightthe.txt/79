<T>__{fade out:}
<L>__{exterior carnival night}
<A>__{the amusement park at port mayer. crowds, carnival noises, a carousel with appropriate music. at a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus bill. everyone is unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. francis holds a mug upside down. frink leers at nikki who ignores him while she, shep and cary down their drinks. they hear:}
<B>__{gunshots.}
<A>__{they look over to see: a little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various colorful targets and win prizes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{sounds like old times.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{let's go and shoot.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{not a bad idea.}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{what say, annie oakley? like to fire off a gun at something?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no objection.}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(to their bartender)}
<D>__{we'll be right back. hold everything.}
<A>__{the group starts over to:}
<B>__{the shooting gallery}
<A>__{where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. cary and shep escort nikki to the arsenal while frink and francis tag along behind. an attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{first one to miss pays for the drinks.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what'll we shoot at?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{all right. look out, pussycat.}
<A>__{shep fires and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range on an endless chain and disappear. but he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe behind them. shep's eyes pop with surprise.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, that's what i was aiming at, a clay pipe.}
<P>__{(stares in amazement)}
<D>__{whole thing's been misrepresented to me.}
<A>__{cary laughs at him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{cary, let's see you shoot something.}
<A>__{cary takes careful aim.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{look out, ball!}
<A>__{he fires and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what'd you aim at?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, let's see you shoot something.}
<A>__{nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. the end of the barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. a multiple exposure point of view shot of the targets reveals that nikki is a little too tipsy to be handling a gun. cary moves to help her.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{how do you hold it still?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{listen, nikki, on your right shoulder. now, put your hand out there and hold up no, don't cover up the site. no, no, no, that's right. now just hold it evenly }
<A>__{rapid gunshots. cary looks up in surprise. he and shep turn to watch in amazement as francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole row of pipes with split second firing. the others cheer as francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an astonished and, apparently, very drunk frink. cary takes this moment to encourage nikki.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{you can do better than that. show him up.}
<A>__{she again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. amused, frink picks up a pistol and imitates her.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{what are you waving at, nikki?}
<A>__{cary sees frink pointing his gun at nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing frink's wrist with both hands.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{look out! why, you fool. don't you know better than that?}
<A>__{shep and francis move to shield nikki.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{what's the idea?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{pointing a loaded gun at nikki?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{take your hands off me.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{put down that gun!}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{let go of my wrist!}
<A>__{frink violently pulls free of cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off with a bang. francis hurries nikki to safety in the opposite direction. shep backs away, clutching his side for a moment, it looks very much as if he's been hit. cary pursues and confronts frink.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{put down that gun!}
<A>__{frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at cary. his face is tense, savage.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{listen, you keep your hands off me! i've had enough from you! you try any more of your rough stuff on me !}
<A>__{a nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, so that's how it is. i thought we taught you how to behave.}
<A>__{frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{you taught me how to behave?! listen, you'd better behave now or you'll get hurt!}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i don't think so. i will give you three to put down that gun. it'll be just too bad if you don't.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{too bad for who?!}
<A>__{frink cocks the hammer.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{one ...}
<A>__{cary moves slowly toward frink.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{keep away from me! i will shoot, i tell ya! i will shoot!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{two ...}
<A>__{frink and cary are less than a yard apart.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i will shoot! i will shoot!}
<A>__{gunshots. cary flinches. frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. he starts to fall. nearby, francis coolly fires his rifle, pumping seven bullets into frink. members of the crowd scream in terror. instinctively, shep (still clutching his side) and nikki each put a restraining hand on francis' arm. francis lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done.}
<C>__{cary's voice}
<D>__{francis?}
<A>__{cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of francis' hands.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{francis?}
<A>__{francis snaps out of his trance as cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the gallery. shep and nikki watch, stunned, as francis immediately moves to cary and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{goodbye, cary.}
<A>__{francis turns to shep and nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look on his face.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{shep. nikki.}
<A>__{they realize he is saying a final goodbye. the crowd presses in as francis glances back at frink before turning and hurrying off. as a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, francis threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building. cary stares at frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then quickly starts to lead a shaken shep and nikki away from the shooting gallery.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{we've got to get out of here. come on, shep. come on.}
<A>__{they slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as francis who is now:}
<B>__{behind the carnival buildings}
<A>__{on a dark, deserted street. distant crowd noise and carnival music drifts in. under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, francis strolls casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing to glance backward. he sees ... ... cary, shep and nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little breathless, to lean against a wall. shep, his fist still at his side, slumps weakly as cary and nikki stare at ... ... francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness. cary and nikki stare after him, astonished.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's the last of francis, i'm afraid. we'll never see him again.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{did you notice his eyes? that's the first time i ever saw francis really happy. what'll happen to him, do you suppose?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{don't worry about, francis. he'll take care of himself. let's get out of here. let's walk.}
<A>__{shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no. don't want to walk. let's take a cab.}
<A>__{cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. nikki rests a sympathetic hand on shep.}
