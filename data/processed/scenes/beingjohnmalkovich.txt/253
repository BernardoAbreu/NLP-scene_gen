<L>__{interior malkovich's bedroom night}
<A>__{malkovich and maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite relaxed.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{you still there, sweets?}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{yeah. i've figured out how to hold on as long as i want. oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{wow.}
<P>__{(little girl pout)}
<D>__{do a puppet show for me, craig honey.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{you mean with malkovich?}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{i'd love to see your work.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{really? yeah. okay.}
<A>__{malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.}
<C>__{malkovich }
<D>__{i will do something i call "craig's dance of despair and disillusionment."}
<A>__{malkovich performs the same dance that the craig pupper did at the beginning of the film. it is exactly the same, complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow. he finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(moved)}
<D>__{that was incredible. you're brilliant!}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{you see, maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{you're right, my darling, it's so much more. it's playing with people!}
<A>__{malkovich kisses maxine. she snuggles close to him.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{stay in him forever?}
<C>__{malkovich}
<P>__{(as malkovich, screaming)}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(as craig, calmly)}
<D>__{but how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{well, we'll have all the money in malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<P>__{(as malkovich, breaking through)}
<D>__{no! please!}
<P>__{(as craig, to malkovich)}
<D>__{shut up, will you? we're trying to think here.}
<P>__{(to maxine)}
<D>__{it is sort of like being a puppeteer. i like that about it.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{no one would ever have to know its not him.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<P>__{(an idea)}
<D>__{wait a minute! what if everybody knew? what if we presented malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? we'd wipe the floor with the great mantini!}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{oh, craiggy, that's brilliant!}
