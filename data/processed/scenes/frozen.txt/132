<L>__{exterior chair lift later}
<A>__{from beneath the chair we see shards of ice and snow fall onto the ground. lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as parker holds him steady.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ok. 1...2...3 }
<A>__{he hoists himself up onto the cable briefly, but after just a few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back. parker holds onto his legs tightly.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{i feel like i gained about 100 pounds overnight.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it was all that pizza talk.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i have no strength.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{then don't do this.}
<A>__{lynch tries again. he hoists himself up, but bails instantly...like a trainer giving up on his 100th pull up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{he settles back down into the assumed position on the chair.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{what? like i'm gonna feel better if i wait a little longer? i should have done it last night while i still had some strength.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{there's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. maybe the jump won't be as bad now.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{even if it was a foot deeper it wouldn't break that fall. i should have just climbed across last night. i had strength. i had adrenaline.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{nothing. let's sit and do nothing.}
<A>__{she reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes. the box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry. she starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack.}
