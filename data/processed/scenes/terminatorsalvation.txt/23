<A>__{bare feet trudge through the dirt. marcus moves along a slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy rags, mud caked on his body. eerie silence. reaching the edge of a rise, he sees in the distance a decimated city, buildings collapsed into rubble.}
<L>__{exterior dead city night}
<A>__{moonlight. the skeleton of a large dog lies on the ground, partially covered by a dusting of snow. it still bears a rotting collar attached to a chain. move to a chain link fence, partially collapsed, a singed, faded sign: "beware of dog." wider, we're in the low rent district of this city in ruins rubble, random walls still stand. hulks of cars, rusted, windowless. it's been over a decade since the bombs fell. marcus is the only thing alive here. he moves down this block, picks up a handful of snow, brings it to his lips. a collapsed newsstand. marcus walks past the racks, picks up a magazine which crumbles in his hands. a human skeleton, clothes in tatters, is half buried behind the collapsed counter. there's a bulge in its shirt pocket. marcus gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane wrapped pack of cigarettes and a butane lighter. marcus sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. he tears open the packet and puts a dried out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame. he lights the cig, inhales deeply he waits for a rush, feels nothing. he takes a few more drags, increasingly disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away. he rises, looks toward a caved in storefront, makes out a clothing store's tattered sign on the ground, amidst broken glass: "sale! going out of business! everything must go!"}
