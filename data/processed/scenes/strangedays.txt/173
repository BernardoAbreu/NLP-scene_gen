<A>__{mace leads the way, with lenny following, gripping faith's hand like orpheus leading eurydice out of hell. they push through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor. half lit, in alcoves, far gone wireheads loll in semi consciousness. faith looks back and sees: tran's posse rounding a corner... spotting them. they start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking protesting people out of the way. mace, lenny and faith break into a run, pounding down the corridor. behind them, duncan leads the charge. suddenly tex arcana shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path with his wheelchair. duncan crashes over him, toppling the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor. vita, beemer and corto go around the sprawl. tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms. lenny looks back to see him pounding duncan's head against the floor...}

<A>__{lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe flashes and a wall of sound. behind them we see corto and beemer hurling partiers aside, cutting a swath, while vita moves like a mongoose through tall grass. mace drops back, going tail end charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in. on lenny and faith, charging through the jostling crowd, lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and... tran is right in front of him. in the whirling shapes and colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a white tux. he holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the bottle in the other. in one lightning fast move he uppercuts with the bottle, clipping lenny under the jaw. faith screams as lenny staggers. tran swings again, smashing the bottle over the back of lenny's head. lenny sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass. lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see faith being pulled away by tran, who has her arm twisted viciously behind her back. they go around a chain link divider and double back, heading for the exit. lenny staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as faith passes within a few inches of him. he slips down the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost in the pounding darkness. mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a cat as the posse arrives. she stands guard over him like a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them expertly. corto eyes her with hatred. the stitches on his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his last run in with her. he backs off.}
