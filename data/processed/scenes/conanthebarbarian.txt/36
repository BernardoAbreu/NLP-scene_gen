<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{lucius screams in pain as conan pours water on the burning guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. then he pulls the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out of lucius' now liberated foot. conan takes lucius' face and smashes it against the table. lucius looks, aghast, as conan takes his injured hand and places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. the cimmerian never even bats an eye.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{what do you want? who are you?}
<A>__{conan turns his face to the burnt side.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i'm the one who made you pretty.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{impossible! you're dead!}
<A>__{conan shows lucius the five scars running down his forearm.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no. i am death. and i came a long way for you.}
<A>__{conan lifts the sword.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{wait!! wait!!}
<P>__{(conan pauses)}
<D>__{i can tell you where the rest are.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{the end of the earth. you kill me, and you'll never find them.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{who are you offering?}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{who do you think? all of them. ukafa, remo, cheren, akhun and khalar singh himself. but you have to swear you won't kill me.}
<A>__{conan thinks about it.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you have my word. you tell me where i will find khalar singh, and i will not kill you.}
<A>__{conan lets lucius go. lucius hobbles to his chair.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{he is in a city called on the edge of the eastern sea. on the edge of hyboria. khor khalba.}
<A>__{conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. he likes what he sees. in a flash, conan grabs lucius' head again, yanking it back, exposing his throat.}
<C>__{lucius }
<D>__{you gave your word!}
<A>__{conan rips a small key from a large keyring. he drops it in lucius' throat. the big man chokes instantly. a second later, conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well. lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as conan releases him.}
<C>__{lucius }
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{toasting, to our deal.}
<A>__{conan swings his sword and cuts the one eyed prisoner from the wall.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{go. you are free.}
<A>__{one eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by shackles.}
<D>__{one eyed prisoner i won't get far like this.}
<A>__{conan hands him a fallen guardsmen's sword.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{the key to your shackles sits in the captain's gut. happy hunting.}
<A>__{the one eyed prisoner grins with malice. as he closes in on the terrified lucius, conan heads for the door.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{barbarian! i had your word! you said you would spare my life!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no. i said i wouldn't kill you.}
<A>__{we hear lucius screams of pain as conan walks out into the night, cutting another notch into his arm.}
