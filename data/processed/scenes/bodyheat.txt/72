<B>__{later}
<A>__{they have finished their salad at a table toward the back. a waiter comes and takes away their dishes. walker has taken off his glasses and is cleaning the lenses with a lovely handkerchief. he does this cleaning with enormous care and inordinate relish. his manner is a mix of gruff charm and hinted menace. there's something dangerous about the man and it's perfectly distilled in his smile, which is quick, frequent and vaguely threatening.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{i was a lawyer. still am, i guess. but i don't practice. went to columbia. you?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{f. s. u.}
<C>__{walker}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{good school. i got bored with it quick. i guess i didn't have the temperament. i wanted to make the money faster. is there a living in it here?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i can afford to send my shirts out. and eat here once a month, if i don't order an appetizer.}
<A>__{walker smiles, re folds his handkerchief carefully and puts it back in the cheat pocket of his jacket.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{i figured an honest lawyer doesn't make much and the other kind was too slimy for me. i'd rather be upfront about shafting somebody.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{edmund, really. it's mr. racine's profession.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's all right. i don't like it much.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{what's to like. that's the way of the world. most people despise their jobs. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{walker picks up a wine bottle and pours more into each of their glasses, emptying it.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{no. i love it. but it's not a job.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what is it, exactly?}
<A>__{walker signals to a distant waiter for another bottle of wine. he does it with a small flick of his finger.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{various things. this and that. here and there.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you don't have to be specific.}
<C>__{walker}
<P>__{(that smile again)}
<D>__{finance, basically. venture capital, investments, real estate. we're into a few things.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah? around here?}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{some. we own some things here.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{edmund's company owns the breakers.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{for a second, walker's eyes flick over matty like a whip.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{it's not that simple. we have an interest in a few places along the shore. for the land. you know. someday. there's no explaining it to her.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(to racine)}
<D>__{i'm too dumb. woman, you know.}
<A>__{she picks up her purse and stands up with a good humored smile. the men rise.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i will be right back. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{then maybe we can talk about pantyhose or something interesting. she walks away. walker watches her go with a satisfied, possessive grin. they sit.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{she's something, isn't she?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{a lovely lady.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{yes, she is. i'm crazy about her. if i ever thought she was seeing another guy... i don't know.}
<P>__{(he takes a sip of wine)}
<D>__{i'd understand how it could happen. her being the way she is. i'd understand it. but i think i'd kill the guy with my bare hands.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's understanding.}
<A>__{walker looks at racine and laughs. as he begins to speak, he focuses intently on racine. he seems to be trying to communicate something other than what he's saying.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{you wouldn't believe the dorkus she was with when i met her. the guy came to us with a business proposition. we're always looking for opportunities. if the conditions are right. we're willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn't too steep. but this guy hadn't done his homework, he didn't know the bottom line. that's how i knew he was full of shit. you've got to know the bottom line. that's all that really counts.}
<A>__{again walker takes off his glasses. he holds them up to the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{he didn't have the goods, this guy. he was like a lot of guys you run into they want to get rich, they want to do it quick, they want to be there with one score.}
<A>__{he puts his glasses back on, stares at racine.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{but they're not willing to do what's necessary. do you know what i mean?}
<A>__{racine looks at him in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm not sure. you mean, lay the groundwork? earn it?}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{no. i mean do what's necessary. whatever's necessary.}
<A>__{the two men stare at each other a few beats.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah. i know that kind of guy. i can't stand that. it makes me sick.}
<C>__{walker}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm not like that.}
<A>__{walker roars with laughter. a huge, powerful burst that shakes the table. and racine laughs with him.}
