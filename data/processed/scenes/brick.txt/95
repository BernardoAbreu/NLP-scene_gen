<L>__{exterior campus square day}
<A>__{brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows.}
<L>__{exterior school hallway day}
<A>__{wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. their footsteps clatter on the cement. brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall he's lost sight of him. brendan sweats, listening. the lug's footsteps echo through the hallways, coming from all directions at once. then it seems clear he's down the hall on brendan's right. brendan dashes left. wrong. the lug looms over him, his knife hand flashing. brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red. he stumbles back blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach. brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner. brendan drops to a sitting position.}
<B>__{the lug around the corner}
<A>__{running fast.}
<B>__{brendan}
<A>__{kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. the lug's footsteps are impossibly loud.}
<B>__{the lug}
<A>__{just about to round the corner.}
<B>__{brendan}
<A>__{on his socked feet running silently back towards the corner. the lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed. brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs into the lug's. the lug pitches forward with frightening momentum. he hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms and head. a hollow gong reverberates through the hallway, and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut. a wallet with a couple of twenties and a student id (chuck burns), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie. brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.}
