<A>__{betty enters the office. joyce is on the phone. she looks up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the caller.}
<C>__{joyce}

<P>__{(to betty)}

<D>__{"banners?"}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{you know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.}
<A>__{betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set joyce gives her.}
<C>__{joyce }
<D>__{'s too bad about the lesabres... they're a really sweet ride.}
<A>__{as joyce prattles on, betty notices the buick lesabre keys on a rack behind her. she sidles around joyce, deftly removes a set from the hook and drops them in her purse. she smiles and starts to wave goodbye as joyce puts her call on hold.}
<C>__{joyce }
