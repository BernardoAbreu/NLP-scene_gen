<A>__{atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the corner. bang! bang! bang! from the landing below, meeks and the woman fire. atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square, shoots. another sidestep. this shot shatters meeks' knee. he bellows in pain. moving to the side again, atwood shoots. but meeks' knee has collapsed and he and the woman are already tumbling down the next set of steps. atwood waits. there's silence, then the murmur of voices.}
