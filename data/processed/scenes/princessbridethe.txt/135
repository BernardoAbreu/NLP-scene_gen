<A>__{watching her closely.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{it's possible; i kill a lot of people. who was this love of yours? another prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby?}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{no. a farm boy. poor. poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm.}

<B>__{buttercup}
<A>__{and probably, if she did not hate roberts so, there would be tears.}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{on the high seas, your ship attacked, and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners.}
<C>__{man in black}
<P>__{(explaining as a teacher might)}
<D>__{i can't afford to make exceptions. once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{you mock my pain!}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{life is pain, highness. anyone who says differently is selling something. i remember this farm boy of yours, i think. this would be, what, five years ago?}
<A>__{buttercup nods.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{does it bother you to hear?}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{nothing you can say will upset me.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{he died well, that should please you. no bribe attempts or blubbering. he simply said, "please. please, i need to live." it was the "please" that caught my memory.}
<C>__{man in black }
<D>__{i asked him what was so important for him. "true love," he replied. and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. i can only assume he meant you. you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{and what am i?}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{faithfulness he talked of, madam. your enduring faithfulness. now, tell me truly. when you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{you mocked me once, never do it again i died that day!}
<A>__{the man in black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine. but then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly,}
