<A>__{shane is walking toward the huddle. in his ear, he hears:}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o)}
<D>__{half your job is getting that huddle in the right mindset. use your imagination, shane.}
<A>__{shane stops short of the huddle. everyone is looking at him. there is a beat and then shane steps in.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay, let's all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living... just last week.}
<A>__{shane looks around the huddle. everybody looks pained and or depressed.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{good. let's kick ass. red right pass 15 x hook.}
<A>__{they break the huddle and shane sets up over evans. he glances over at brian murray. murray is lined up in a three point stance at tight end. but his head is turned and he's looking directly at shane.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{red fifteen! red fifteen! hut!}
<A>__{shane nods on the snap. the front five, in the persons of andre, jamal, reese, mickey lee and cochran, hit out and simultaneously knock their men on their backs. shane, with plenty of time, hits murray over the middle for twelve yards. shane looks over at the sidelines. mcginty is smiling.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{a) shane}
<D>__{is under pressure but he rolls smoothly and rockets the ball downfield.}
<A>__{murray pulls it in for fifteen yards. b) shane}
<D>__{rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a cornerback and throws back across field, complete to lamont coming out of the backfield.}
<A>__{c) patriot}
<D>__{is calling for a fair catch on a punt. he catches the ball but bateman flies into frame and decks him. flags fly.}
<A>__{d) andre and jamal}
<D>__{are blocking side by side, pushing their men back as lamont squeezes through with the ball.}
<A>__{e) evans}
<D>__{is pass blocking like the all pro that he is. he knocks his man flat and then doubles up on cochran's man.}
<A>__{f) bateman}
<D>__{is pursuing a running back. he knocks down an official and runs right over him. then he gets his hands on the running back and pushes him out of bounds and then knocks over a photographer.}
<A>__{g) shane}
<D>__{pumps once and then drills a twenty yard spiral. clifford franklin beats his man and dives for the ball. he bobbles it, and then squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the ground.}
