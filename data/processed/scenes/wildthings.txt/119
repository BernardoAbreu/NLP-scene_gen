<A>__{the teeth go into a plastic bag.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{black and whites, county cars police tape across the site. ray, gloria and hunter watch as dave merritt, a forensic expert bags the teeth. he passes the bag to ray, then bends to the rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{lonbardo and kelly killed her here.}
<A>__{hunter and gloria exchange a look.}
<C>__{gloria}

<D>__{those are suzie toller's teeth.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{where's the body?}
<C>__{ray}

<A>__{he holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. and i found the car at the miami bus terminal.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you don't think sam could've put it there?}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{dust it for prints. my guess is, if anybody murdered suzie it was probably that little sociopath kelly van ryan.}
<A>__{ray shakes his head; he turns to dave, still working.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{how soon can we get something?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{we can get blood type right away. dental records will take longer. you want dna, that can take weeks.}
<A>__{ray nods, looks out to sea.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{poor dumb suzie, she never had a chance.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{we don't know that, ray...}

<D>__{you get an id, you call me.}
<A>__{dave nods. hunter stalks off toward his car. ray turns to gloria.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{will you do me one favor?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{ray, you heard him...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what if i'm right, gloria? what if i'm right and hunter's wrong?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you do if you see a bad thing coming?}
<A>__{gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{stick with me on this gloria. i need you...}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{and if the teeth aren't suzie's? you'll give this up?}
