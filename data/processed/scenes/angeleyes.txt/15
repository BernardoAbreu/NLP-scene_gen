<L>__{interior catch's apartment corridor same night}
<A>__{catch is arriving home, soaking wet. he lives in a slightly seedy three story. as he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock. he pauses and then knocks softly on the door. someone looks through the peephole and then opens the door a young single mother, friendly but with a little caution, too. she recognizes catch. behind her is a little boy, (five). the woman's name is candace. her son is tommy.}

<A>__{he gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them, more friendly now.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{oh, thank you. thanks a lot. god. i was trying to carry tommy and all these bags. he was so tired. of course, as soon as i put him down he had all this energy...}
<A>__{while she is talking, catch is staring deeply at the boy, who is shy. catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to, goes halfway to a smile but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in catch. he nods a good bye to the mother and is about to go. she thinks about this, as he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution to say...}

<A>__{he smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already retreating. his contact goes only so far and no further.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{sorry. gotta be going.}
<A>__{and with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his apartment, unlocks it and steps in.}
