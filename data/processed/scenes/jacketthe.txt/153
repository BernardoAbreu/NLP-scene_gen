<L>__{interior jackie's car, day, 2004}
<A>__{jackie and starks sit inside the parked car as starks touches his head.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's all you got from him? that bastard helped take your life away from you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no, he didn't.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what? how can you say that? he's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...jacket. he's probably the one who killed you.}
<A>__{and with those words, jackie starts to break down.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no one's killing anyone.}
<A>__{starks takes her hand and runs it over his head.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{touch me. i'm okay.}
<A>__{starks looks at her with love, understanding and, for the first time, a sense of peace. he strokes her hair to calm her down.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{if everything hadn't happened the way it has, then i wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why are you saying that? [beat] we don't have long, do we?}
<A>__{starks looks at her without answering. jackie wipes her eyes, fastens starks' seat belt, and seeing that starks' eyes have started to flutter, starts driving. in the distance, the barely audible sound of the drawer opening, and their time ending, is heard.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{to the hospital.}
