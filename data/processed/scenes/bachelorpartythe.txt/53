<L>__{interior. fourteenth street crosstown subway}
<A>__{long shot looking down through the length of one almost empty car, through the open door at the end of the car, down into the next almost empty car. just a few people riding the subway at this hour, half past eleven on a week day. but down in the second car, we can see our four cavaliers. eddie, arnold, and charlie are sitting. our attention is most caught by walter, who is heavily drunk and weaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car. we cannot hear if he is saying anything. close shot walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car. he stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker, sitting in the car.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{excuse me ... excuse me ...}
<P>__{(turns his blurred}
<D>__{attention to charlie, who, alone of the three, seems painfully interested in what walter is talking}
<P>__{about)}
<D>__{so what'll i do? i mean, he says, i'm going to die. i mean, the man's a specialist. he says: "go to arizona, go to colorado," he says. "you got to get out of new york or you're going to die." he tells my wife, the stupid idiot. my wife cried all night. i'm going to die, you know that? you understand that? i'm going to die? you know what an asthma attack is like? your heart starts beating like a drum! i passed out the last time!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(deeply compassionate)}
<D>__{walter, why don't you just quit the job and pack your bags and get out of here?}
<A>__{walter stands in front of charlie, his lips moving, but no words coming out for a moment. there are tears in his eyes, and all the pain and anguish of the man's forty eight years are clear on his face.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(getting the words out)}
<D>__{i can't quit. don't you understand? you don't understand. i can't quit! i got a fourteen year old girl, i don't know what time she comes in at night any more. she's so wild, these kids. i got a nineteen year old boy in college; he's going to be a doctor if i have to die. he's not going to quit school. you hear me! i worked hard to put that kid in school! i don't care if i die! i don't care! what am i going to do in arizona? who wants me? who's going to give me a job? what kind of a job am i going to get? i'm forty eight years old. they don't want no forty eight year old bookkeeper. they got machines from ibm. you ever been up on the ninth floor? you ever see all those ibm machines? what am i going to do out in arizona? you look in the help wanted lately? you see any jobs listed for bookkeeper, male? what are you talking about? do you know what you're talking about?}
<A>__{charlie reaches up to steady walter, who has worked himself up into a lurching fury.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{easy, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(flinging charlie's hand aside)}
<D>__{take your hand off me. you don't know nothing! you're just a kid! you don't know! i've seen death, kid. i've seen it, boy. i know what it looks like.}
<P>__{(he staggers away a}
<D>__{few paces down the aisle, stumbles over}
<P>__{the man's toe again)}
<D>__{excuse me.... forty eight years old and so what? what does it mean? what happened? what have i got? what did i make? who needs me? so this is it. a man's life, nothing. worry about being sick, worry about making money, worry about your wife, worry about your kids, and you're on your way to the grave from the day you're born. the days drag on, and the years fly by, and so what?}
<P>__{(cries out to the whole world)}
<D>__{what is it all about? will you tell me?}
<A>__{the train is slowing up for a station now.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{life is nothing! it's a gag! it's a joke! it's a mortgage! it's a bankrupt! it's a lot of noise over nothing! sound and fury! isn't that what the man said? what do you think, i never read a book? i read a book! don't worry! i was a bright kid! everybody thought i was going to be the first catholic to be president! where did it all go?!}
<A>__{he turns to look at the station they are edging into, the yellow lights, the dark shadows, the few blurred faces. his face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{where did it all go?}
<A>__{the train stops, the green doors slide open.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(looking out, in a low voice)}
<D>__{where are we, third avenue?}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(low voice)}
<D>__{where are we getting off? next stop?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(low voice)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{a few people come into the car. walter stands, shoulders hunched and sagging, in front of the open doors.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{what did you say, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<A>__{walter steps out onto the platform. just in time, because the doors are beginning to slide closed again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{walter, where are you going? come here ...}
<A>__{on the platform, walter has started to weave slowly up the platform toward the stairway.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{what, did walter get out?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(calling through the open window)}
<D>__{walter, stay there, we'll come back on the next train. stay there.}
<A>__{but walter has already reached the stairway and, clinging to the handrail, has started slowly climbing the steps. the train starts slowly up. arnold has stood now too. he is pretty soggy himself.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{poor walter, huh?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(bellowing through the window)}
<D>__{walter! ...}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{he'll be all right, charlie. god protects drunks and fools.}
<A>__{the train is sweeping by the stairway now. charlie bellows out:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{walter! grab a cab if you're going home!}
<A>__{the train has swept by, and in a moment they have been plunged into the tunnel of the subway, the bleak dirty white walls, and the small yellow lights flashing by. charlie sits down, somehow greatly shaken and disturbed.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{poor walter, i didn't know he was so sick. i thought there was something wrong with him, though. he's been out so much.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(sitting drunkenly down)}
<D>__{i didn't know he was so sick.}
<A>__{close in on charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's me in fifteen years.}
<A>__{closeup of charlie. hold for a moment.}
