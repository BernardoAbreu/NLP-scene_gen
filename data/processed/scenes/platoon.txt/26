<C>__{shouts}
<D>__{hold it up! hold it up!}
<A>__{the firing has ceased. a silence, punctuated by occasional shouts and fast moments, has enveloped once more the cemetery. doc crashes through the bush, kneels over tex, who continues to howl in deep pain.}

<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i'm hit ...}
<A>__{barnes and big harold come hustling up. doc finishes tourniquetting tex, cradles chris onto the earth, his flashlight probing the wound. tex in background continues to thrash and moan. chris waits, tensely for the verdict, his eyes big with fear on doc, who takes out his morphine.}
<C>__{junior}
<P>__{(to barnes, pointing at chris)}
<D>__{that dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!}

<D>__{shut up! shut up and take it! take the pain!}
<A>__{tex's eyes roll wildly, uncomprehending. doc and big harold looking at barnes, wondering. tex is suddenly silent, shocked. barnes stands, an icy glare, goes. junior scrambles over to tex's side. doc runs off. big harold cradles chris, his big black hands like a mother, reassuring him.}
<C>__{big harold}
<D>__{you gonna be okay taylor, okay, don't you start worrying now.}
