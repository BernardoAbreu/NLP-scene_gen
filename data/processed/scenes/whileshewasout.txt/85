<L>__{exterior unfinished house 1 evening}
<A>__{she finds herself back where she started, at the same house. the mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they always were. the ford's still there ahead. and then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her.}
<C>__{della}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{no! oh no.}
<A>__{she bites back a sob.}
<L>__{exterior construction site evening}
<A>__{della shrinks backwards between the houses. she ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead. she runs into the house and out through the far side. skirts a row of plots of land. then, she hears chuckie's mocking voice, echoing through the building site.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{della!}
<A>__{della recoils. did she just hallucinate? how the hell do they know her name? can they see her? or is he just shouting her name randomly into the night? her eyes dart right then left then back again. nothing. she runs down a row of house foundations.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{della!}
