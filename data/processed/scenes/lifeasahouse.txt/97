<L>__{exterior colleen's house late afternoon}
<A>__{colleen is standing in the entry, talking to josh.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{you can come in and wait if you'd like.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what friends did she go with?}
<L>__{exterior george's house late afternoon}
<A>__{robin pulls right back to where she was parked and parks again. she steps out of the car talking.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{nothing is going on with us, is it?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{going on?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{when i picked you up from the train station...what you said.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that thing about i was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. what was that?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that was the truth.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you've never said that before.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will say a lot of things i've never said before. it's habit.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it sounded like a pick up line.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can't pick you up.}
<A>__{robin sits down, weighted by the reason.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm married.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you bit my finger.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{if i weren't married?}
<A>__{george wants to answer quickly, dismiss the impossible and move on, but emotion catches him off guard. he forces a smile.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{let's not do this, okay?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i need to know.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you need to know what? do i still love you?}
<A>__{robin is surprised by the question. she nods her head.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{absolutely. there's not a doubt in my mind that through all my anger...my ego, i was faithful in my love for you. from seventh grade on.}
<A>__{robin raises her eyebrows what a revelation.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{that i made you doubt it, that i withheld it...that's the greatest mistake of a life full of mistakes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but the truth doesn't set us free, robin. i can say it as many times as you can stand to hear it. and all that does, the only thing, is remind us that love isn't enough. not even close.}
<A>__{tears well in robin's eyes as she stands.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i should go.}
<A>__{george nods she should. robin walks to her car, opens the door; she faces george before climbing in. george walks into the garage.}
