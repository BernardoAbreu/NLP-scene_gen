<L>__{exterior the malt shop night}
<A>__{cars flash by in a rare l.a. downpour. all that's left of mom's is an empty building with a painted out front window and a "for sale or rent" sign. there's another shop attached to it camera right but we can't see what it is. the alley way on the left has always been there.}
<L>__{interior malt shop continuous}
<A>__{two drunk bums are sharing a bottle. one of them is the soda jerk, now a dissipated middle aged man (with a tattoo on his forehead.)}
<C>__{soda jerk}
<D>__{...all of these things...alcoholics anonymous...cocaine anonymous...heroin anonymous.}
<C>__{other bum}
<D>__{there's a heroin anonymous?}
<C>__{soda jerk}
<D>__{shut up! all of these things... ask you to believe in a power greater than yourself! some sort of god on high! well...i have lifted my eyes skyward a time or two... and i have certainly not seen anything coming from up there except a goddamn airplane that i can't afford to get on!}
<A>__{the cement floor of the old malt shop begins to quiver}
<B>__{and rumble.}
<C>__{other bum}
<D>__{earthquake! another earthquake!}
<C>__{soda jerk}
<D>__{let her come! let's get this over with! and please, if there is a god, let it be worse in bel air!!}
<A>__{the other bum staggers to his feet and splits for a back window. soda jerk is fearless. until finally the hydraulic doors of the back entrance split the floor with an eerie, struggling whine and large chunks of cement go flying. then up comes red submarine light followed by calvin in his big yellow suit with geiger counter ticking.}
<C>__{soda jerk}
<D>__{oh, god! oh, god!! oh,god, save me!! for i have seen the light!!}
<A>__{calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i come in peace!!}
<A>__{the soda jerk faints. calvin, sounding like a deep sea diver and having to walk like frankenstein, goes over to the soda jerk and studies his face in the light of his flashlight. he is horrified by what he sees.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{my, gosh...}
<A>__{calvin looks around the room and heads for the back. he moves his geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe) reading. then he removes a kitchen match from a plastic container and strikes it against the wall. the match burns, so calvin takes off his hood and visor and breathes the air. it stinks in there.}
