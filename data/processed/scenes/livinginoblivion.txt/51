<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, chad. what happened; i thought you were going to hold back till "me"?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{the more i thought about it the more it didn't seem right. and i'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if i just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know, that seems a little...}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, i'm just throwing out ideas here. trying to get the juices flowing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole, how does that feel to you?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{well, i can turn to look at him. but won't you be shooting the back of my head?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{plus chad is completely out of the light down there.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, wolf; i'm not worried about my face, man. it's about the acting; that's all i care about.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{it's your call, nick. his acting or his face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{for some reason i was hoping we could get both.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i thought that's what we were trying to do here.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i will have to set another light.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{we're ahead of schedule, nick. i think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for mr. palomino.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{good, let's do it. ellen, damian; let's talk for a second.}
<A>__{as nick, nicole, and palomino step off the set wanda speaks to the crew in general.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{we'll pause to set this light and go again right away. how long, wolf?}
<A>__{wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, watching the gaffer set up a light.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{wolf?}
<A>__{wolf walks away from wanda without a word. the entire crew watches this.}
