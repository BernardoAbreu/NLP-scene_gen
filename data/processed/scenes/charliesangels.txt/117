<L>__{exterior italian street night}
<A>__{jason and alex are walking down a beautiful, tree lined cobblestone street, holding hands. the buildings and outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely european town. charlie's angels 8 18 99}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{jason, i don't...}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? i'm sick of how little we see each other. i'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's my job, jason. i can't explain it, but i have to be on call, all the time, and...}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{what if i changed all that?}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{jason }
<D>__{what if i told you to quit your job, and come live with me. what i'm saying, alex, is that i want you to...}
<A>__{blam! blam! gunshots ring out!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{gunfire! get down!}
<A>__{alex, in angels mode, immediately throws him to the ground and covers him. she feels something wet, looks down to see jason's chest, covered in blood.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{my god, you're hit. you're...}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{fine. i'm fine.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{they're squibs, it's fake. see?}
<A>__{he wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue. finally convinced, she almost lets herself laugh.}
<B>__{reveal}
<A>__{that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is just a set. the gunfire was coming from some effects guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the open loading door.}
<C>__{jason }
<D>__{fake guns, too. they're just setting up for the next scene.}
<A>__{he helps her up.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sorry about that, i...}
<C>__{jason}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{god, i loved that. the way you yelled and everything? baby, you been watching too many movies.}
<P>__{(he kisses her on the nose)}
<D>__{alright, i gotta go reset these. don't go anywhere. i want to finish this conversation.}
<A>__{as he walks out of the soundstage, alex is left behind, alone. she cleans herself off, shaking her head at her own paranoia. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nice, alex. real nice.}
<A>__{thipp! a wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster. alex looks at the hole. that's strange. thip, thip! two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{hey, is someone firing more squibs or...}
<A>__{suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with silenced gunfire. it's only alex's instincts that let her duck in time to avoid being turned into swiss cheese. she tucks and rolls behind a styrofoam set as... two gunmen with silenced sniper rifles fan out on the fake city street. on alex crouched behind a wall. she looks both ways. if she tries to break for the open loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to jason. only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the way across the building, where there's a fire exit. taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.}
<B>__{the gunmen}
<A>__{fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going to machine gun mode. the sound of the gunshots are covered by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside. alex sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams. she lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the two by fours in half.}
<B>__{the gunmen}
<A>__{move slowly through the fake street set. suddenly, they hear a creaking sound. they look up to see the whole, fake building set collapsing! they dive out of the way, just in time to see alex race through the fire doors. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
