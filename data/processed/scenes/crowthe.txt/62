<L>__{exterior gideon's pawn shop night}
<A>__{as seen from across the street. eric silhouetted, unmoving as the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining glass and debris. stirring his hair. eric is the black eye of the fireball. low angle front of pawn shop emphasize eric lit by flames and residual explosions. he hurls the shotgun into the inferno. casually brushes flaming smoking detritus from his own clothes.}
<C>__{albrecht }
<D>__{don't move! i said don't move.}
<A>__{new angle eric as he turns slowly, to see albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn. eric's attitude lightens; albrecht is not the threat here.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i thought the police always said "freeze:.}
<A>__{albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of gideon's.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{i'm the police and i say don't move, snow white. you're under arrest; i don't care what else is wrong with you! you move and you're dead.}
<A>__{eric has begun to pace towards albrecht. palms up. a gesture of submission. albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{and i say i'm dead... and i move.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{no further. i'm serious.}
<A>__{eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{then shoot, if you will.}
<A>__{tight angle albrecht he gives it up. can't shoot. this is too weird for him.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{are you nuts, walking into a gun?}
<A>__{new angle less threatening eric and albrecht}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you must listen carefully: the fire department will be here soon. there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.}
<P>__{(meaningfully)}
<D>__{as shelly webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.}
<A>__{albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed gun. b.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{you wanna run that back for me one time?}
<A>__{sirens near, o.s. eric listens to them, to the night.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{listen: top dollar. he "owns the street here." he will "erase my ass."}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i know top dollar has turned your streets into his hell.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{fucking a, my friend.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{the others are called skank, t bird. street names. funboy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{watch me, office albrecht.}
<A>__{eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk. slow and easy. albrecht doesn't completely trust him. up comes the gun.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{watch it...}
<A>__{eric slices open his palm. blood flows. to his fingertips. new angle eric and albrecht as eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall... then exhibits the gashed hand to albrecht. close up eric's hand as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.}
<B>__{tight on albrecht}
<A>__{and the silhouette. mouth hangs.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{you're the one who did tin tin...}
<A>__{pull back fast to reveal eric is gone from the frame. albrecht does a quick 180. no eric. flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face.}
<C>__{albrecht }
<D>__{great. good night. guy shows up looking like a mime from hell.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{least he didn't do that "walking against the wind" shit; i hate that.}
