<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.}
<A>__{karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches julie's eye. she walks across the lobby.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{julie, where are you going?}
<A>__{julie keeps walking. she sees historical pictures of the hotel: work crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing next to sailfish and marlin. near the pictures, julie sees the globe. it's spinning slowly. julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. it stops spinning. she looks down at it. close on the globe and julie's hand finding brazil. we see the capital is not rio, but brazilia. this is dawning on julie when we hear }
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{brasilia.}
<A>__{she jumps out of her skin. estes was standing right there in the shadows.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{that's the capital of brazil, not rio.}

<D>__{no }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we found your voodoo crap }
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{they shake estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{i found the bodies this morning...i tried to use the radio, but he already destroyed it.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{let him go. i believe him.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{come on, julie. you saw his room.}
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{i haven't hurt anyone...i stole those things to help you. to protect you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he's telling the truth. he could've easily killed me. he didn't.}
<P>__{(beat while this sinks in)}
<D>__{look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...this whole thing was a setup.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{rio isn't the capital of brazil. it was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<P>__{(starting to lose it)}
<D>__{you've got all these theories but where is he? where? where's your fisherman killer?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{you never do...the guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. little notes that only mean something to you. how do we even know you're not the one behind this }
<A>__{estes steps forward }
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(to tyrell)}
<D>__{how do we know you're not?}
<C>__{estes}
<P>__{(to julie)}
<D>__{i know who you're talking about. he used to work here at the hotel.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i've seen him around again. out in the woods by the orchard.}
<A>__{they look at estes...is he telling the truth?}
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{i can't remeber his name, but i don't forget a face.}
<P>__{(beseeching)}
<D>__{i can show you...}
<A>__{they stare a beat }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how do we know you're not setting us up?}
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{where else you gonna go, son?}
<A>__{they look to the office, the gym...the sense of death surrounding them.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{i know i don't want to stay in here.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{we'll be better off in the open. if we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.}

<D>__{show us.}
<A>__{they begin moving for the door.}
