<CHAR>__{ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{ou're confusing humility with humiliation.}
<CHAR>__{TONY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's not true.}
<CHAR>__{ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday.}

<CHAR>__{ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{TONY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Which is?}
<CHAR>__{ELIZABETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has.}
