<L>__{exterior downtown l.a. night}
<A>__{it's after hours downtown. dark, empty, dead...}
<L>__{interior library tower 40th floor corridor night}
<A>__{lights out on the 40th. engraved brass announces: j.a. kuehn & associates, architects. two flashlight beams strafe wood paneled, elegant offices: danny and rusty on late night reconnaissance. as danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box. at last, danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the vault at the bellagio.}
<A>__{a beat as rusty scans the document, then another underneath it.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{if i'm reading these right and i think that i am this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oops. actually, you know what, i'm wrong. it's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{rusty's brow furrows just a little.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you said three casinos...}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(flips to next blueprint)}
<D>__{these feed into the cages at both the mirage and the m.g.m. grand.}
<P>__{(tapping vault)}
<D>__{but every dime ends up here.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{the bellagio, mirage, and... these are terry benedict's places.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yes, they are. think he'll mind?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{more than somewhat.}
<A>__{at 40th floor elevator bay no ding. the elevator just arrives. its doors part to reveal a security guard within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit.}
<B>__{back with danny and rusty}
<A>__{as danny rolls up the set of blueprints, rusty considers the plan (which, in our absence, danny has pitched him).}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{like what, you think?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{well, off the top of my head, i'd say you're looking at a boesky, a jim brown, a miss daisy, two jethros, and a leon spinks. oh, and the biggest ella fitzgerald ever.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{as long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. terry benedict has a list of enemies.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{but does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose...}
<P>__{(smiles, realizing)}
<D>__{aha.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(smiles, too)}
<D>__{aha.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{reuben.}
<B>__{moving with security guard}
<A>__{as he approaches danny's and rusty's voices...}
<B>__{back with danny and rusty}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{so...}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{so, here's what i think: you should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. sleep on it. turn it over in your head. then: never bring it up to me again.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{uh huh. so what are you saying?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{really? i thought it was much harder than that }
<A>__{suddenly the security guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. danny and rusty put their hands up to block the light.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{jesus, oscar, lower it a little, will ya?}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(lowers beam)}
<D>__{you two done up here? find what you wanted?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. you mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? make some copies.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{whatever you need.}
<A>__{danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the security guard's hand.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{'preciate it.}
<A>__{at 40th floor elevator bay danny and rusty wait for an elevator. when its doors open, rusty stops danny from boarding.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i need a reason. and don't say money.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why do this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why not do it?}
<A>__{rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{because yesterday i walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking teenbeat coverboys.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because the house always wins. you play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. and then you take the house.}
<A>__{a beat. rusty smiles.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you're been practicing that speech, haven't you?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a little. did i rush it? it felt like i rushed it.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{no, it was good.}
<A>__{they step aboard the elevator. as the door closes:}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i wonder what reuben will say?}
<A>__{danny and rusty look at each other.}
<C>__{tishkoff }
<D>__{you're out of your goddamn minds.}
