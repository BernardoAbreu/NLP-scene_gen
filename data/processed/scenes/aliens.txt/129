<L>__{interior med lab annex operating room}
<A>__{ripley carries an exhausted newt through the inner connecting rooms of the medical wing. she reaches an operating room which is small but very high tech ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment. several metal cots have been set up, displacing o.r. equipment which is pushed into one corner. newt is resting her head on ripley's shoulder, barely awake...out of steam. ripley sets her on one of the cots and newt lies down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{now you just lie here and have a nap. you're exhausted.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{i don't want to...i have scary dreams.}
<A>__{this obviously strikes a chord with ripley, but she feigns cheerfulness.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i will bet casey doesn't have bad dreams.}
<A>__{ripley lifts the doll's head from newt's tiny fingers and looks inside. it is, of course, empty.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{nothing bad in here. maybe you could just try to be like her.}
<A>__{ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back. newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that five year old shit on me, lady. i'm six."}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{oh. sorry, newt.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{my mommy always said there were no monsters. no real ones. but there are.}
<A>__{ripley's expression becomes sober. she brushes damp hair back from the child's pale forehead.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes, there are, aren't there.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{why do they tell little kids that?}
<A>__{newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal. she's seen that the world can be just as terrifying as her most primal child's nightmare if not more so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is no santa.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well, some kids can't handle it like you can.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{did one of those things grow inside her?}
<A>__{ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in around her tiny body.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't know, newt. that's the truth.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{isn't that how babies come? i mean people babies...they grow inside you?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no, it's different, honey.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{did you ever have a baby?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yes. a little girl.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{gone.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{you mean dead.}
<A>__{it's more statement than question. ripley nods slowly. she turns, reaching for a portable space heater sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed. she switches it on. it hums and emits a cozy orange glow.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{ripley, i was just thinking... maybe i could do you a favor and fill in for her. just for a while. you can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. i will understand. no big deal. whattya think?}
<A>__{ripley gazes at her a long time before answering... a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them may see another dawn.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i think it's not the worst idea i've heard all day. let's talk about it later.}
<A>__{she switches off the light and starts to rise. newt grabs her arm. a plaintive voice in the dark.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{don't go! please.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i will be right in the other room, newt. and look...i can see you on that camera right up there.}
<A>__{newt looks at the video security camera above the door. ripley unsnaps the tracker bracelet given to her by hicks and puts it on newt's tiny wrist, cinching it down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{here. take is for luck. now go to sleep...and don't dream.}
<A>__{ripley walks away and newt rolls on her side, hugging casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function light on the bracelet. the space heater hums comfortingly.}
