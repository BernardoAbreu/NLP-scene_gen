<L>__{interior prancing pony inn night}
<A>__{wide on: the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of big folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall... clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous... sam can't help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{sam, he'll be here. he'll come.}
<A>__{merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer.}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{this, my friend, is a pinterior}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{it comes in pints? i'm getting one!}
<A>__{sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've had a whole half already. merry watches pippin go.}
<A>__{a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at frodo, then quickly look away.}
<C>__{sam }
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{that fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we've arrived.}
<A>__{sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. frodo gestures to butterbur...}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he?}
<C>__{butterbur}
<D>__{he's one of them rangers; they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. what his right name is, i never heard, but round here he's known as strider.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{strider.}
<A>__{beneath table: frodo's fingers are nervously toying with the}
<B>__{ring.}
<A>__{close on: frodo sweat runs down his brow. the strange hum of the ring spills into the soundtrack. "baggins...baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill frodo's head...sound that dissolves into pippin's loud voice:}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{baggins? sure, i know a baggins...he's over there...}
<A>__{angle on: pippin sitting at the bar, chatting with locals. frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar.}
<C>__{pippin}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{frodo baggins. he's my second cousin once removed, on his mother's side and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side...if you follow me.}
<A>__{frodo grabs pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{pippin!}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{steady on, frodo!}
<A>__{pippin pushes frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. at that instant, the inn goes silent and all the attention turns to frodo...}
