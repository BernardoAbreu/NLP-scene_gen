<D>__{you there. ogre!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{aye?}
<C>__{head guard}
<D>__{by the order of lord farquaad i am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, really? you and what army?}
<A>__{he looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off. the guard tucks tail and runs off. shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{can i say something to you? listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. incredible!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{are you talkin' to...(he turns around and donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and donkey is right in front of him.) whoa!}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{yes. i was talkin' to you. can i tell you that you that you was great back here? those guards! they thought they was all of that. then you showed up, and bam! they was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. that really made me feel good to see that.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, that's great. really.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{man, it's good to be free.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? hmm?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{but, uh, i don't have any friends. and i'm not goin' out there by myself. hey, wait a minute! i got a great idea! i will stick with you. you're mean, green, fightin' machine. together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.}
<A>__{shrek turns and regards donkey for a moment before roaring very loudly.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, wow! that was really scary. if you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some tic tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(shrek covers his mouth but donkey continues to talk, so shrek removes his hand.) ...then i ate some rotten berries. i had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{why are you following me?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i will tell you why. (singing) 'cause i'm all alone, there's no one here beside me, my problems have all gone, there's no one to deride me, but you gotta have faith...}

<D>__{stop singing! it's no wonder you don't have any friends.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{wow. only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.}

<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{that would be my home.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh! and it is lovely! just beautiful. you know you are quite a decorator. it's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. i like that boulder. that is a nice boulder. i guess you don't entertain much, do you?}

<D>__{i like my privacy.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you know, i do too. that's another thing we have in common. like i hate it when you got somebody in your face. you've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. there's that awkward silence.}

<D>__{stay outside.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(from the window) i am outside.}

<C>__{blind mouse1}
<D>__{well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?}
<C>__{blind mouse2}

<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(holds up a mug of beer) can't we just}
<D>__{settle this over a pint?}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{kill the beast!}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{no? all right then. (drinks the beer)}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{he takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him. the beer comes rushing out drenching the other men and wetting the ground. it's like mud now. shrek slides past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. as shrek begins to fight donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. it breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. there is so much fighting going on here i'm not going to go into detail. suffice to say that shrek kicks butt.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{hey, shrek, tag me! tag me!}
<A>__{shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against donkeys. shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{a man tries to sneak up behind shrek, but shrek turns in time and sees him.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{the chair! give him the chair!}
<A>__{shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. finally all the men are down. donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match. the audience goes wild.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, yeah! ah! ah! thank you! thank you very much! i'm here till thursday. try}
<P>__{the veal! ha, ha! (laughs)}
<A>__{the laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on shrek.}
<C>__{head guard}
<D>__{shall i give the order, sir?}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{no, i have a better idea. people of duloc, i give you our champion!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{congratulations, ogre. you're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{quest? i'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{your swamp?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, my swamp! where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{indeed. all right, ogre. i will make you a deal. go on this quest for me, and i will give you your swamp back.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{exactly the way it was?}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{down to the last slime covered toadstool.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{and the squatters?}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{as good as gone.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what kind of quest?}
<A>__{time lapse donkey and shrek are now walking through the field heading away from duloc. shrek is munching on an onion.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{let me get this straight. you're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. is that about right?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i don't get it. why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, i know what. maybe i could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. does that sound good to you?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{uh, no, not really, no.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{for your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{example?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{example? okay, um, ogres are like onions.}
<P>__{(he holds out his onion)}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(sniffs the onion) they stink?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yes no!}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{they make you cry?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no! layers! onions have layers. ogres have layers! onions have layers. you get it? we both have layers. (he heaves}
<P>__{a sigh and then walks off)}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(trailing after shrek) oh, you both}
<D>__{have layers. oh. {sniffs} you know, not everybody likes onions. cake! everybody loves cakes! cakes have layers.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i don't care... what everyone likes. ogres are not like cakes.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you know what else everybody likes? parfaits. have you ever met a person, you say, "let's get some parfait," they say, "hell no, i don't like no parfait"? parfaits are delicious.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no! you dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! ogres are like onions! and of story. bye bye. see ya later.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you know, i think i preferred your humming.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{do you have a tissue or something? i'm making a mess. just the word parfait make me start slobbering.}
<A>__{they head off. there is a montage of their journey. walking through a field at sunset. sleeping beneath a bright moon. shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, so donkey pees on the fire to put it out. dragon's keep shrek and donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to house princess fiona. it appears to look like a giant volcano.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(sniffs) ohh! shrek! did you do that?}
<D>__{you gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. my mouth was open and everything.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{believe me, donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) it's brimstone. we must be getting close.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{yeah, right, brimstone. don't be talking about it's the brimstone. i know what i smell. it wasn't no brimstone. it didn't come off no stone neither.}
<A>__{they climb up the side of the volcano keep and look down. there is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is. it is surrounded by boiling lava. it looks very foreboding.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns}
<P>__{into a groan)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{uh, shrek? uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, aye.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{well, i have a bit of a confession to make. donkeys don't have layers. we wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{wait a second. donkeys don't have sleeves.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you can't tell me you're afraid of heights.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{no, i'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{come on, donkey. i'm right here beside ya, okay? for emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{really, really.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{okay, that makes me feel so much better.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{just keep moving. and don't look down.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{okay, don't look down. don't look down. don't look down. keep on moving. don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) shrek! i'm lookin' down! oh, god, i can't do this! just let me off, please!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{but you're already halfway.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{but i know that half is safe!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{okay, fine. i don't have time for this. you go back.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek, no! wait!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{just, donkey let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the}
<P>__{bridge)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{don't do that!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. do what? oh, this? (bounces}
<P>__{the bridge again)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{yes, that!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yes? yes, do it. okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs donkey across}
<P>__{the bridge)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{no, shrek! no! stop it!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you said do it! i'm doin' it.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die. shrek,}
<P>__{i'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{that'll do, donkey. that'll do. (walks}
<P>__{towards the castle)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{cool. so where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{inside, waiting for us to rescue her.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i was talkin' about the dragon, shrek.}
<B>__{inside the castle}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you afraid?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{shh.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, good. me neither. (sees a skeleton and gasps) 'cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. unfamiliar dangerous situation, i might add. with a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. i sure as heck ain't no coward. i know that.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey, two things, okay? shut ... up. now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{stairs? i thought we was lookin' for the princess.}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(putting on a helmet) the princess will}
<D>__{be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{what makes you think she'll be there?}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{i read it in a book once. (walks off)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{cool. you handle the dragon. i will handle the stairs. i will find those stairs. i will whip their butt too. those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.}
<P>__{(walks off)}
<B>__{empty room}
<A>__{donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i'm gonna take drastic steps. kick it to the curb. don't mess with me. i'm the stair master. i've mastered the stairs. i wish i had a step right here. i'd step all over it.}
<B>__{elsewhere}
<A>__{shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(os) dragon!}
<A>__{donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. shrek manages to grab donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey, look out! (he manages to get a hold of the dragons tail and holds on) got ya!}
<A>__{the dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and shrek goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the tallest tower. fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying on the floor.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh! aah! aah!}
<A>__{donkey get cornered as the dragon knocks away all but a small part of the bridge he's on.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{no. oh, no, no! (the dragon roars) oh, what large teeth you have. (the dragon growls) i mean white, sparkling teeth. i know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. do i detect a hint of minty freshness? and you know what else? you're you're a girl dragon! oh, sure! i mean, of course you're a girl dragon. you're just reeking of feminine beauty.}
<P>__{(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes}
<D>__{at him) what's the matter with you? you got something in your eye? ohh. oh. oh. man, i'd really love to stay, but you know, i'm, uh...(the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs) i'm an asthmatic, and i don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. shrek! (the dragon picks him}
<P>__{up with her teeth and carries him off)}
<D>__{no! shrek! shrek! shrek!}
<A>__{fiona's room shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. his back is to fiona so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. she then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off the side table. she then lays back down and appears to be asleep. shrek turns and goes over to her. he looks down at fiona for a moment and she puckers her lips. shrek takes her by the shoulders and shakes her away.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{oh! oh!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{wake up!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{are you princess fiona?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{i am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, that's nice. now let's go!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but wait, sir knight. this be ith our first meeting. should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, sorry, lady. there's no time.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{hey, wait. what are you doing? you should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(smiles) mm hmm.}
<A>__{shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down the hallway.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but we have to savor this moment! you could recite an epic poem for me. a ballad? a sonnet! a limerick? or something!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{can i at least know the name of my champion?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{uh, shrek.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{sir shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{thanks!}
<A>__{suddenly they hear the dragon roar.}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(surprised)you didn't slay the dragon?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{it's on my to do list. now come on!}
<P>__{(takes off running and drags fiona behind him.)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but this isn't right! you were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. that's what all the other knights did.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, right before they burst into flame.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior (shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him.) oh! (shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side.) wait. where are you going? the exit's over there.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{well, i have to save my ass.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{what kind of knight are you?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{one of a kind. (opens the door into}
<P>__{the throne room)}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(os) slow down. slow down, baby, please.}
<D>__{i believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. just call me old fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as shrek sneaks into the room) i don't want to rush into a physical relationship. i'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this magnitude really is the word i'm looking for. magnitude hey, that is unwanted physical contact. hey, what are you doing? okay, okay. let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. we really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. i'm on the road a lot, but i just love receiving cards i'd really love to stay, but don't do that! that's my tail! that's my personal tail. you're gonna tear it off. i don't give permission what are you gonna do with that? hey, now. no way. no! no! no, no! no. no, no, no. no! oh!}
<A>__{shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon. he misses and he swings back again. he looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. he pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. instead the dragon kisses shreks' butt. she opens her eyes and roars. shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her. she roars again and shrek and donkey take off running. very 'matrix' style. shrek grabs donkey and then grabs princess fiona as he runs past her.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{hi, princess!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{it talks!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.}
<A>__{they all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. shrek spots a descending slide and jumps on. but unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits shrek right in the groin. his eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down donkey and fiona.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{okay, you two, heard for the exit! i will take care of the dragon.}
<A>__{shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the castle. he throws the sword down in between several overlapping chain links. the chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the dragons neck.}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(echoing) run!}
<A>__{they all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot pursuit. they make it to the bridge and head across. the dragons breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. they all hang on for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. they are swung to the other side. as they hang upside down they look in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to get them. but suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the dragon back and she's unable to get to them. our gang climbs quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a sad whimper as she watches donkey walk away.}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) you}
<D>__{did it! you rescued me! you're amazing.}
<P>__{(behind her donkey falls down the hill)}
<D>__{you're you're wonderful. you're...}
<P>__{(turns and sees shrek fall down the}
<D>__{hill and bump into donkey) a little unorthodox i will admit. but thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. i am eternally in your debt. (donkey clears his throat.) and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i hope you heard that. she called me a noble steed. she think i'm a steed.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{the battle is won. you may remove your helmet, good sir knight.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{uh, no.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i have helmet hair.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{please. i would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, no, you wouldn't 'st.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but how will you kiss me?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what? (to donkey) that wasn't in the job description.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{maybe it's a perk.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{no, it's destiny. oh, you must know how it goes. a princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{hmm? with shrek? you think wait. wait. you think that shrek is you true love?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{well, yes.}
<A>__{both donkey and shrek burst out laughing.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you think shrek is your true love!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{what is so funny?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{let's just say i'm not your type, okay?fiona: of course, you are. you're my rescuer. now now remove your helmet.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{look. i really don't think this is a good idea.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{just take off the helmet.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i'm not going to.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{take it off.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{now!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{okay! easy. as you command. your highness.}
<P>__{(takes off his helmet)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{you you're a an ogre.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, you were expecting prince charming.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{well, yes, actually. oh, no. this is all wrong. you're not supposed to be an ogre.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{princess, i was sent to rescue you by lord farquaad, okay? he is the one who wants to marry you.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{then why didn't he come rescue me?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{good question. you should ask him that when we get there.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but i have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his his pet.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{well, so much for noble steed.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you're not making my job any easier.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. you can tell lord farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, i will be waiting for him right here.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{hey! i'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (ominous) i'm a delivery boy.}
<P>__{(he swiftly picks her up and swings}
<D>__{her over his shoulder like she was a}
<P>__{sack of potatoes)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{you wouldn't dare. put me down!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{ya comin', donkey?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i'm right behind ya.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! this is not dignified! put me down!}
<B>__{woods}
<A>__{a little time has passed and fiona has calmed down. she just hangs there limply while shrek carries her.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{okay, so here's another question. say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. how do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{you just tell her she's not your true love. everyone knows what happens when you find your...(shrek drops her on the ground) hey! the sooner we get to duloc the better.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you're gonna love it there, princess. it's beautiful!}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{and what of my groom to be? lord farquaad? what's he like?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{let me put it this way, princess. men of farquaad's stature are in short supply.}
<P>__{(he and donkey laugh)}
<A>__{shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off the dust and grime.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i don't know. there are those who think little of him. (they laugh again) fiona: stop it. stop it, both of you. you're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord farquaad.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, well, maybe you're right, princess. but i will let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(looks at the setting sun) tomorrow?}
<D>__{it'll take that long? shouldn't we stop to make camp?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, that'll take longer. we can keep going.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{but there's robbers in the woods.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{whoa! time out, shrek! camp is starting to sound good.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{hey, come on. i'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{i need to find somewhere to camp now!}
<A>__{both donkey and shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.}
<B>__{mountain cliff}
<A>__{shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. he shoves a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{hey! over here.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek, we can do better than that. i don't think this is fit for a princess.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{no, no, it's perfect. it just needs a few homey touches.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{homey touches? like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at fiona}
<P>__{who has torn the bark off of a tree.)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{a door? well, gentlemen, i bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and}
<P>__{puts the bark door up behind her)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you want me to read you a bedtime story? i will.}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(os) i said good night!}
<A>__{shrek looks at donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with fiona still inside.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek, what are you doing?}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(laughs) i just you know oh,}
<D>__{come on. i was just kidding.}
<B>__{later that night}
<A>__{shrek and donkey are sitting around a campfire. they are staring up into the sky as shrek points out certain star constellations to donkey.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{and, uh, that one, that's throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{right. yeah. hey, can you tell my future from these stars?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{the stars don't tell the future, donkey. they tell stories. look, there's bloodnut, the flatulent. you can guess what he's famous for.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i know you're making this up.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, look. there he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{that ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you know, donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. hmm? forget it.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(heaves a big sigh) hey, shrek, what}
<D>__{we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{our swamp?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you know, when we're through rescuing the princess.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{we? donkey, there's no "we". there's no "our". there's just me and my swamp. the first thing i'm gonna do is build a ten foot wall around my land.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you cut me deep, shrek. you cut me real deep just now. you know what i think? i think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, do ya think?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{are you hidin' something?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{never mind, donkey.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, this is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{why don't you want to talk about it?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{why do you want to talk about it?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{why are you blocking?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i'm not blocking.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, yes, you are.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey, i'm warning you.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{who you trying to keep out?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{everyone! okay?}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(pause) oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. (grins)}
<A>__{at this point fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out. neither of the guys see her.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh! for the love of pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff}
<P>__{and sits down)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{what's your problem? what you got against the whole world anyway?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{look, i'm not the one with the problem, okay? it's the world that seems to have a problem with me. people take one look at me and go. "aah! help! run! a big, stupid, ugly ogre!" they judge me before they even know me. that's why i'm better off alone.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you know what? when we met, i didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{so, uh, are there any donkeys up there?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{well, there's, um, gabby, the small and annoying.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{okay, okay, i see it now. the big shiny one, right there. that one there?}
<A>__{fiona puts the door back.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{that's the moon.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<A>__{duloc farquaad's bedroom the camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. soft music plays in the background. farquaad is in bed, watching as the magic mirror shows him princess fiona.}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{again, show me again. mirror, mirror, show her to me. show me the princess.}
<C>__{mirror}
<D>__{hmph.}
<A>__{the mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.}
<C>__{farquaad}
<D>__{ah. perfect.}
<A>__{farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as though fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly at her image in the mirror.}
<B>__{morning}
<A>__{fiona walks out of the cave. she glances at shrek and donkey who are still sleeping. she wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. she begins to sing. the bird sings along with her. she hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes. fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. time lapse, fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. shrek and donkey are still sleeping. shrek wakes up and looks at fiona. donkey's talking in his sleep.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(quietly) mmm, yeah, you know i like}
<D>__{it like that. come on, baby. i said i like it.}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{donkey, wake up. (shakes him)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{huh? what?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{wake up.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{what? (stretches and yawns)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{good morning. hm, how do you like your eggs?}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, good morning, princess!}
<A>__{fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what's all this about?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{you know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. i wanted to make it up to you. i mean, after all, you did rescue me.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{uh, thanks.}
<A>__{donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{well, eat up. we've got a big day ahead}
<P>__{of us. (walks off)}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{they are once again on their way. they are walking through the forest. shrek belches.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what? it's a compliment. better out}
<P>__{than in, i always say. (laughs)}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.}
<A>__{fiona belches}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{she's as nasty as you are.}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(chuckles) you know, you're not exactly}
<D>__{what i expected.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.}
<A>__{she smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops fiona up into a tree.}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{la liberte! hey!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{princess!}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(to robin hood) what are you doing?}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{be still, mon cherie, for i am you savior! and i am rescuing you from this green...(kisses up her arm while fiona pulls back in disgust)...beast.}

<D>__{hey! that's my princess! go find you own!}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{please, monster! can't you see i'm a little busy here?}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(getting fed up) look, pal, i don't}
<D>__{know who you think you are!}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{oh! of course! oh, how rude. please let me introduce myself. oh, merry men.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<A>__{suddenly an accordion begins to play and the merry men pop out from the bushes. they begin to sing robin's theme song.}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{i steal from the rich and give to the needy.}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{he takes a wee percentage,}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{but i'm not greedy. i rescue pretty damsels, man, i'm good.}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{what a guy, monsieur hood.}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{break it down. i like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{what he's basically saying is he likes to get...}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{paid. so...when an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. that's bad.}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{that's bad.}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{when a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.}
<C>__{merry men}
<D>__{he's mad, he's really, really mad.}
<C>__{robin hood}
<D>__{i will take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause i'm about to start...}
<A>__{there is a grunt as fiona swings down from the tree limb and knocks robin hood unconscious.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{man, that was annoying!}
<A>__{shrek looks at her in admiration.}
<C>__{merry man}
<D>__{oh, you little (shoots an arrow at}
<P>__{fiona but she ducks out of the way)}
<A>__{the arrow flies toward donkey who jumps into shrek's arms to get out of the way. the arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree. another fight sequence begins and fiona gives a karate yell and then proceeds to beat the crap out of the merry men. there is a very interesting 'matrix' moment here when fiona pauses in mid air to fix her hair. finally all of the merry men are down, and fiona begins walking away.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{uh, shall we?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{hold the phone. (drops donkey and begins walking after fiona) oh! whoa, whoa, whoa. hold on now. where did that come from?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{that! back there. that was amazing! where did you learn that?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in}
<P>__{case there's a...(gasps and points)}
<D>__{there's an arrow in your butt!}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what? (turns and looks) oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out}
<P>__{but flinches because it's tender)}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{oh, no. this is all my fault. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{(walking up) why? what's wrong?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{shrek's hurt.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{shrek's hurt. shrek's hurt? oh, no, shrek's gonna die.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey, i'm okay.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{you can't do this to me, shrek. i'm too young for you to die. keep you legs elevated. turn your head and cough. does anyone know the heimlich?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{donkey! calm down. if you want to help shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{blue flower, red thorns. okay, i'm on it. blue flower, red thorns. don't die shrek. if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! shrek & fiona donkey!}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh, yeah. right. blue flower, red thorns.}
<P>__{(runs off)}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what are the flowers for?}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(like it's obvious) for getting rid}
<D>__{of donkey.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{now you hold still, and i will yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little}
<P>__{pull)}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(jumps away) ow! hey! easy with the}
<D>__{yankin'.}
<A>__{as they continue to talk fiona keeps going after the arrow and shrek keeps dodging her hands.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but it has to come out.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{no, it's tender.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{now, hold on.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{what you're doing is the opposite of help.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{don't move.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{look, time out.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{would you...(grunts as shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow) okay. what do you propose we do?}
<B>__{elsewhere}
<A>__{donkey is still looking for the special flower.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{blue flower, red thorns. blue flower, red thorns. blue flower, red thorns. this would be so much easier if i wasn't color blind! blue flower, red thorns.}

<D>__{ow! not good.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{okay. okay. i can nearly see the head.}

<D>__{about...}

<D>__{ow! ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall}
<P>__{over with fiona on top of him)}

<P>__{(throwing fiona off of him) nothing}
<D>__{happend. we were just, uh }
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. okay?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, come on! that's the last thing on my mind. the princess here was just (fiona pulls the arrow out) ugh! (he turns to look at fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) ow!}
<C>__{donkey}
<P>__{hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle)}
<D>__{that's...is that blood?}
<A>__{donkey faints. shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way. there is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to duloc. shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small brook so that fiona won't get wet. shrek then gets up as donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and donkey flies off. shrek swatting and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs. she then hands it to shrek who begins eating like it's a treat. as he walks off she licks her fingers. shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting it to fiona. fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning it into a balloon animal and presenting it to shrek. the group arriving at a windmill that is near duloc.}
