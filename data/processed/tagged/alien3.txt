<B>__{one particular monk}
<A>__{black skinned, early fifties. stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else. it moves him to song. lilting tenor lifts high into the air. this is brother kyle.}
<C>__{brother kyle}
<D>__{well would he guess the ascending of the star, wherein his patient's fortunes settled were. he knew the course of every malady, were it of cold or heat or moist or dry. brother john, would be doctour of physick.}
<A>__{we see the object of his song:}
<B>__{brother john}
<A>__{not yet forty. strong features, but fear behind the eyes. the fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence. a good face, nonetheless. he stirs a thick mixture in a mortar. next to him another monk sits holding his arm out in front of him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious burn.}
<C>__{brother kyle}
<D>__{tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf. but heals not, so easily, the ills which plague himself.}

<D>__{yes, doc tor.}
<A>__{kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass a blob of white hot glass hanging on the end. he rolls the blob on the marver, a flat, polished piece of iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. john wraps a fray edged cloth bandage around the burn.}

<A>__{he points to the top of his forearm.}

<A>__{kyle pushes him through the door...}
<L>__{into the hallway}
<A>__{the hallway is alive with cassocked monks. their low chanting reverberates throughout the building. the wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights. this is obviously a medieval monastery...}

<A>__{a narrow corridor lined with doorways. john moves to one in particular. he doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob. this is his room. he opens the door in brother john's room an old, worn out dog lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock which is now serving as its bed. at the sight of john it stands.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{come on, mattias.}
<A>__{the dog, mattias, joins him in the hall. monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. past another dozen or so monks who are on their way down.}
<L>__{interior library}
<A>__{a vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches between aisle after aisle of floor to ceiling wooden shelves jammed to capacity with books of all shapes and sizes. millions of books, from the looks of it. from each book hangs a long chain, long enough to allow the book to be carried only as far as the nearest table. a corpulent monk brother philip in his fifties, and the librarian by his stern affect, his position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large key hanging from his belt. he watches the few stragglers return their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door, then rises and joins them...}
<B>__{in the corridor just outside the library}

<D>__{as did mine. as long as you're alone. enjoy yourself and remember, no book leaves the library.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how could i forget? have a good meal...}
<A>__{john watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs. when he's gone from sight john lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal mattias.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{they move into the library...}
<B>__{the medieval section}
<A>__{the oldest books. john moves to the stacks. mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits. this is his regular place.}
<B>__{at the shelves}
<A>__{john stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient tome. he runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding. a smile plays across his lips. he carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain. sits on the bench next to the dog. clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...}

<A>__{john turns to find }
<B>__{the abbot}
<A>__{leader of the monastery. in his seventies but looks younger. his cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden chain in place of a rope belt. he crosses to the table. john closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.}
<D>__{john abbot, i i didn't think anyone would }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{mind? just philip, if he knew. i passed him on the way up. he said you'd come in alone. i knew better.}
<A>__{he scratches the back of mattias' neck.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{hello, mattias. how are you, boy?}
<A>__{the dog snuffles in response.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you know what philip says about mattias' hair and his breathing. you'll have to take him out of here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he likes when i read to him and i can't }
<A>__{john looks down sheepishly. though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the abbot. the abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.}
<C>__{abbot}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{someone must have left this one unlocked. take the book with you.}
<A>__{he hands the key to john, who is shocked this is a great honor.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{father, i ?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will reserve judgement until the patient lives.}
<A>__{john crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book. he returns the key.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{it will get easier. father anselm was... an unexpected loss. you'll do fine.}
<A>__{the abbot walks towards the door...}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{just have it back before the end of lunch. oh and i didn't see you in here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to mattias)}
<D>__{let's go upstairs, boy.}
<A>__{john takes his book moves to a spiral wooden staircase. mattias at his heels. goes up }
<L>__{into the bell tower}
<A>__{the mechanics of the bell tower all ropes and wooden cogs cast scary shadows. a doorway leads to }
<B>__{the roof of the abbey}
<A>__{thick with sandy dust. the wood shows through thin patches. we pull back to reveal what we think is the roof of the abbey is actually the surface of arceon night the door has opened onto the surface of a plantoid! the curving horizon broken only by the very top of the abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below. smoke curls from vents set into the surface. sunken areas of the planet's sirface are seas. this is arceon. an manmade orbiter. a shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter. constructed by the company on special order with habitable level within finished in whatever material suits its end user. this orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been sheathed in wood.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{in the year of our lord 1348 i, brother gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury the abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day by day, one by one, until i am the only one left. i stayed as long as i could bear it, then with my dog }

<B>__{next to the hatch}
<A>__{a small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency. john hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal lever. he stares at it...a beat. then quickly pulls it down... wuorrrsh ! hull door opens. the doorway is a black maw. john crosses himself. begins to lower his foot into the hatch }

<B>__{john}
<A>__{looks back towards the door. part of him wants to get the hell out here but he fights back his fear. he is a doctor or trying to be someone in here may need his help. he presses forward averts his gaze from the clothing, up to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid }
<B>__{lights}
<A>__{pressure lights. data lights. warning lights. thousands of lights. like the stars in the sky. it's been decades since he's seen technology like this and never this close up. he steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....}

<A>__{the warning tone of the woman's message rekindles john's fear. he moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments drawn to touch a button. click... something tentacle like drops down on his shoulder! just an oxygen mask. john feels his rapidly beating heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. his hand brushes over a sensor which responds by lighting and hsssssssss ! a blast of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe john shouts and back up into another hyper sleep tube!!! next to newt's now empty tube. humming gently. still operational. john approaches it cautiously. he can make out the occupant through the lid...}

<A>__{the abbot points to the door.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{on the other side of that door. waiting for us to starve to death.}
<A>__{ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's playing with us. it could get in here any time it wants.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{why should he enter? he knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sir. we're all in the same coracle, so to speak.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{maybe more than one of us.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{let's talk about the facts, mr. abbot.}
<A>__{she looks at the windmills.}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{this is your technology?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{even this is forbidden to us.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well then, the facts are that we're screwed.}
<A>__{she moves into the room. walks around one of the windmills.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{an eco system. nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants. winds generated down here }
<P>__{(looks at the floor)}
<D>__{windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water...}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{more than that. there are pumps beneath the floor i can feel their vibration.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{probably pumping this air through charcoal filters.}

<A>__{john looks at her questioningly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer cutting off the sun's rays cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood.}

<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the greenhouse effect. it's how the earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{don't you see? this is a planet set to self destruct. not in ten minutes or two hours but soon. your atmosphere here is finite. if the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen this planetoid will be dead everyone will die.}

<D>__{bastard!! it came out of his fucking head!}

<D>__{i didn't have to see that to know what that means.}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{there are several inconsistancies between this and the other aliens you described.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{give it up.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i think this is important. this may help us fight it. the creature that i fought in the hall when i first saw it, it had camoflaged itself to look like wood.}
<A>__{ripley looks up.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{wood? when i saw it in my room it looked the way it did before black, mechanical unless that was a dream.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i don't think it was. i think that this creature, if it is the efficient predator that you say it is, has the ability to adapt to its environment.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{then the reason they've always looked the same to me is that i only ever saw them in the same environment.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{or this may be an as yet unseen stage of development you saw a queen this could be like a king ant more highly advanced than the drone, bred for survival ?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how does this explain the thing that came out of the ewe's chest? the abbot's head?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{maybe it can deposit different types of eggs. the chest burster is probably dormant until the host eats the first one i ever saw came out of kane after he started to eat }

<C>__{john}

<A>__{anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills. he winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff. it sparks. the large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head. the wind blows through his hair.}

<A>__{feels good. anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."}
<C>__{anthony}

<D>__{well come then. i haven't got forever.}
<A>__{a shadow falls across his face. he can feel it. he doesn't have to see what is here. the underground ocean day into night the leather boat makes its way across the sea. john rows while ripley holds the torch aloft. as night falls she takes the oars. the ocean is dead calm. the coracle glides across the glass like surface. john flexes his scarred fingers.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your hands okay?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they'll be fine. you've been on a boat before.}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how old were you when they towed this satellite out here?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{five. the abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here. we've had almost forty more. until now.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what happened to your mother?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{never had one. i mean, never knew her. i mean, i did, once. she left my father when he joined the movement. if she hadn't i wouldn't be here. they kept the other children with the women, on earth. that was too long ago now. like a dream.}
<A>__{ripley's face grows strangely dark. she turns to the water.}

<D>__{the girl in the ship with ?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no. on earth. i never mentioned my daughter. my daughter. i have had i guess, by now a daughter on earth. kathy. she was nine when i signed on to the nostromo. mommy will be home before you know it i said. my shares would have set us up good. then i lost sixty years floating around in a rescue pod. thanks to the alien. i came home to face a bitter, 70 year old woman. my daughter. a little girl who's mother never came home.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they said i should have been happy to be alive. funny, huh? that's why i went back the second time. not so i could fight it you can't fight it so i could let it kill me.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{you didn't choose to get lost in space.}

<A>__{suddenly they feel rain ripley holds out her hand. her eyes open wide at what she sees. john takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side: the ocean has become red with blood. blood drips down from the ceiling around them.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{blood.}
<A>__{john looks up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{from the levels above.}

<B>__{up the ladder}
<A>__{a hundred foot climb. the wood is twisted. rungs have been torn away in some places. they pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest foothold. the temperature rises as they do. sweat runs into their eyes. soon they can see the floor above them: blackened by intense heat. they climb.}

<A>__{ripley and john come up from the level below.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{john crosses himself. another testament to the terrible battle with the alien. reduced to just a huge, blackened floor. all the crops burned to ash their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted monks. their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{no! no, goddammit you can't do this. you can't let it win.}
<A>__{she turns away from the door.}
