<L>__{interior windsor castle, brown's quarters night}
<A>__{the room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of the life here shocks her deeply. the cheap furniture, the anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of brown. he is lying in bed, barely conscious. after a moment, he opens his eyes and stares at her. she steps forward, smiling nervously. her voice is the old voice, between friends.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{you should never have gone out in such foul weather.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{someone has to look after you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it could've been someone. it was before.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{yes. yes it was.}
<A>__{he cannot speak. it's difficult for her too, but she speaks for him.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{my ministers are as impertinent as ever. dispatches are now so numerous, they come in a trunk. sometimes i do believe they will never stop. endless letters...}
<A>__{her voice falters. a pause}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{i know i have not always been the loyal friend you deserved, john. and yet here i am now, even now, feeling desperate at the thought of losing you.}
<A>__{she starts to cry.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{don't be silly, woman.}
<A>__{his old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together. seeing a bowl of water on the side table, she steps across. carefully folding a cloth in four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when brown gestures protectively.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{not too near.}
