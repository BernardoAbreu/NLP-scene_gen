<A>__{two rooms. fireplace. pile of wood. a realtor would call it cozy. in truth it's just tiny and freezing cold. blomkvist unpacks. puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, cd's, a cd player, his laptop and a small printer. he flips open his cell phone to make a call. gets no reception bars. hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in. he opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette. then looks at him.}
