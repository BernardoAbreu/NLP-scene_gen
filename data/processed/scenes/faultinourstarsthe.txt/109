<L>__{int hazel's bedroom another morning}
<A>__{hazel puts on her funeral dress. she looks in the mirror.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{but that wasn't the truth. the reason i called it a nine was... i was saving my ten.}
<L>__{int church day}
<A>__{the place is filled today with mourners for augustus waters. hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back, watching people she's never seen before approach the waters family and extend their deepest condolences.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{and this was it. the great and terrible ten.}
<A>__{when mr. and mrs. waters see hazel, they open their arms.}
<C>__{mrs. waters}
<D>__{he loved you so much.}
<A>__{hazel nods. hugs them back.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he loved you so much too.}
<A>__{more mourners approach the family, leaving hazel stranded in the receiving line. her eyes turn towards the coffin. she's not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath, wills herself to walk towards it. gus is there in the same suit he wore to oranjee. immediately, hazel breaks down. and immediately, she catches herself.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's ok, you hear me? it's ok.}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses his cheek. she looks around. once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of camel lights and sticks them in the space between gus and the lining of the coffin. a minister approaches at that moment.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{i think we're ready to begin.}
<A>__{hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in the middle of the room.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{augustus waters fought hard for many years. his battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us...}
<A>__{hazel frowns. this is all such bullshit. and she hears:}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{what a load of shit, eh kid?}
<A>__{hazel recognizes that voice. but it doesn't make sense. she turns around and, sure enough, it's peter van houten.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{let us pray.}
<A>__{everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. hazel keeps staring at van houten, too shocked to do a thing.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{we need to fake pray now.}
<A>__{van houten bows his head. hazel, still stunned, slowly turns back to the minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected appearance.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{now i call on augustus's close friend isaac to say a few words.}
<A>__{isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help. hazel sneaks one more look at van houten. yup, it's really him. that makes no sense to her. isaac starts to speak.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{of all the things i've lost in my life, this hurts the most.}
<A>__{and isaac stops talking. it's unclear if that was the end or if he just can't go on. he returns to his seat. the minister walks back up.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{and now we'll hear from gus's... special friend hazel lancaster.}
<A>__{hazel stands, walks up to the podium. a few titters in the room at the words "special friend."}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i was his girlfriend.}
<A>__{some laughter from the crowd. she takes out her notes.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{there's a beautiful quote in gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain."}
<A>__{hazel continues to speak but we over it, we hear instead:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i didn't believe a word, of course. but that was ok. funerals, i'd decided, aren't for the dead. they're for the living.}
<A>__{gus's parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. cut to:}
