<L>__{interior cloud city carbon freezing chamber}
<A>__{luke and vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber. their swords clash, the platform sways. luke aggressively drives vader back, forcing vader to use defensive tactics.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{you have learned much, young one.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you'll find i'm full of surprises.}
<A>__{vader makes two quick moves, hooking luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying. another lightning move at luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself. losing his balance, luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon freezing platform. there he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. just in time he looks up to see vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. luke rolls away as vader lands. crouching, luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{your destiny lies with me, skywalker. obi wan knew this to be true.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{behind luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. all the while, luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the dark lord. suddenly, vader attacks so forcefully that luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening. there is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure vader's vision. vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{all to easy. perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought.}
<A>__{through the steam behind vader something blurs upward. liquid metal begins to pour into the pit. vader turns around and then looks up. he sees luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{impressive... most impressive.}
<A>__{luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from vader by the steaming carbonite pit. he raises his hand. his sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. vader immediately lights his sword as well.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{obi wan has taught you well. you have controlled your fear... now release your anger.}
<A>__{luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. he begins to retreat as vader goads him on. as luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. a quick sword exchange and luke forces vader back. another exchange and vader retreats. luke presses forward.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{only your hatred can destroy me.}
<A>__{breathing hard, luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over vader. he lands on the floor and slashes at vader as the room continues to fill up with steam. vader retreats before luke's skillful sword. vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. the energy luke has used to stop vader has brought him to the point of collapse. luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of vader. he then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.}
