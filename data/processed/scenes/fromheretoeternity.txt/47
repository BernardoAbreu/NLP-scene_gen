<A>__{maggio and prew, dressed in slacks and aloha shirts, stand in front of what looks like a renovated residence. they give evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial drinking. the sound of loud piano playing is heard from within. a sign over the door reads: new congress club soft drinks dancing recreation members only. the door opens and mrs. kipfer stands at the threshold. she is a sophisticated looking woman with upswept hair, wears an evening gown with a corsage of orchids. the piano music, louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of the following. the pianist is hammering out "i don't want to set the world on fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).}
