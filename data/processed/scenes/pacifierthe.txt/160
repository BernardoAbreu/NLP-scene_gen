<A>__{shane turns the light on. gary follows shane as he looks for tool. suddenly, the duck starts quacking... shane turns. gary's foot is caught in a grate.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what happened, gary?}
<A>__{shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries gary's foot from the grate. shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye. shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the grate... we see a crank wheel.}
<C>__{shane }
