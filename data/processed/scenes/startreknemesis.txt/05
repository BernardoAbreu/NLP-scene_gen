<A>__{the sun is setting on the capital city of the great romulan star empire, the imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the horizon. we slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city. the romulan senate chamber.}
<L>__{interior romulan senate chamber sunset}
<A>__{senator tal'aura watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference. she glances to the familiar romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird of prey holding two planets, one in either claw. and then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to... praetor hiren the head of the romulan government presiding over the senate from a throne like chair. he is a capable politician in his 50s.}

<D>__{... but if we hesitate we'll lose this important source of dilithium. a trade agreement is in the best interests of the empire.}
<C>__{senator 2}
<D>__{praetor, i recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to celes ii to open negotiations.}
<A>__{senator tal'aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations." praetor hiren glances to her.}
<C>__{praetor}
<D>__{senator tal'aura, you disagree with the motion.}
<C>__{tal'aura}
<D>__{no, sir. i would say "negotiation" is to be advised. i support all "diplomatic" overtures. but if you will excuse me, praetor, i have an appointment with the tholian ambassador.}

<D>__{then i will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes ii...}
<A>__{the senator at the desk next to tal'aura's glances over. the silver box is moving. the senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open. then "legs" appear. the box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs. then it is still for a moment. the senator looks at it, puzzled. suddenly a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider the senators are stunned the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy. in a way, it is bizarrely beautiful. and then just as suddenly the light disappears. a moment of silence. the praetor and senators are baffled.}
<C>__{praetor}
<D>__{would someone please tell me what that was?}
<P>__{(he turns to a guard)}
<D>__{alert security }

<C>__{praetor}
<D>__{ and have them run a }
<A>__{the praetor stops suddenly as the flesh begins to melt from his face. every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays. flesh melts from bones while the senators scream in agony. every living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds. a stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage. then a transporter effect ripples around the spider weapon. it disappears. and the romulan senate is no more. we fade to...}
