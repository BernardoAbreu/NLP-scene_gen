<L>__{interior museum halls night}
<A>__{pendergast and margo walk together though various exhibits and halls. they pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and stuffed behind glass.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem, venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. that boat washed up in my district. everyone on board was killed.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{and john?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{disappeared. his body wasn't among the victims.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. just like beauregard. one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.}
<A>__{margo pales.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{john couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. he was a fine man despite his problems }
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{you loved him.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(a moment, taken aback)}
<D>__{yes. once. we met at columbia. john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{you were going to be married.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{how did you know that?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley. got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times. i also found a record of your restraining order.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that was two years ago. john was still in love with me.}
<P>__{(she looks down)}
<D>__{he wouldn't leave me alone.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{you were afraid of him, weren't you?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{he was afraid of himself. he tried suicide once. he was ill. manic depressive. he had wild emotional highs and lows. not a happy affliction for a scientist. he'd been revered in our community. by the end he was a joke.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{tell me about the last expedition. what was he looking for?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a legendary monster called mbwun.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{a monster?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes. he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect. it held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". it made no sense. but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no one knows. the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.}
<A>__{margo's voice catches again. pendergast reaches for his handkerchief but she shakes her head, determined to keep control.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no. i'm all right. i won't let this affect me anymore. john wouldn't get help. his ego endangered the lives of others. his theory came first.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? was he desperate enough to create one?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{something came up in autopsy tonight. imbedded in beauregard's body we found a claw.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{my god. then it was an animal.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i don't think so. i think we were meant to think it was mbwun. did whittlesley's monster have claws?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't know. he sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. but i've never seen it. it's in the exhibit.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{would you mind showing it to me?}
