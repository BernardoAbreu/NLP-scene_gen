<C>__{frank}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you figure no one can get by you here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if someone is willing to swap his life for a kill, nothing can stop him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{great. what do i need you for?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he might get me instead.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and you're ready to die for me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's my job.}
<A>__{rachel looks at him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and you'd do it? why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i can't sing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe there's some glory in saving a president or something, but just anyone...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you mean like you? it's a matter of conditioning and discipline.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't trust discipline. at the crucial moment i'd cop out.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that happens.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{but not with you, fierce frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it happens.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{have you ever liked anybody?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{like me a girl.}
<A>__{frank knows what she's driving at. but he's not at all happy to relinquish this information.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a long time ago.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what happened? do you mind if i ask?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{do you mind if i don't answer?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't want to pry...}
<A>__{frank smiles at that.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(begins to laugh, can't help herself)}
<D>__{she didn't die did she? you weren't like... protecting her and she got killed?}
<A>__{frank is silent, grim. rachel looks stricken.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh, my god! that's it, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nobody's perfect.}
<A>__{rachel is taken aback.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh frank, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{frank laughs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no... nice try though.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was less dramatic than that. she didn't love me anymore. can you imagine such a thing?}
<A>__{frank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty charming. rachel looks at him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, not really.}
<A>__{a song comes on the jukebox 'what becomes of the broken hearted.' frank smiles as rachel begins to sing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so, is this a full service date, frank?}
<A>__{frank's wary.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm just asking you to dance.}
