<L>__{exterior highway gas station morning}
<A>__{from across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz by) we see milo pumping gas at a self serve; lisa fills up in the next lane. ostensibly, they have run into each other on the way to work. they are smiling, casual. only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear no connection to their words.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what about the fbi?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{they've got this guy in the doj, maybe others. we tell the wrong person, it's over.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{who can we trust?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{there's always a logical answer you just have to define the question.}
<A>__{she defines it:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{how do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person.}
<A>__{she pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless female." he comes over to help her.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we don't tell anybody.}
<P>__{(she's puzzled)}
<D>__{we tell everybody. at once. so there's no secret left to protect. when everybody knows, they don't dare touch us.}
