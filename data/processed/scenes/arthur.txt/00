<L>__{exterior manhattan night}
<A>__{a homeless man, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in manhattan's deserted night time financial district. the street starts to vibrate. a terrifying growl approaches. a huge black shape smashes into view the dark knight's batmobile! our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. the homeless man dives for cover. bam! the batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars. we hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `wall street'. sirens herald three police cars in hot pursuit. the batmobile roars up wall street, bashing against the new york stock exchange, thumping up and down the federal hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'charging bull' statue. two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the batmobile's bonnet and roll away. the cop cars screech up, surrounding the batmobile. two older cops and a rookie surround it, weapons drawn. a helicopter appears, blazing the batmobile in white light.}
<C>__{rookie cop}
<D>__{cooool.}
<A>__{an older cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a flashlight into a tiny window. the batman actually drunken english socialite arthur bach templemead in a costume lowers the window and offers a handshake.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{evening, constable!}
<C>__{older cop 1}
<P>__{(seen it all before)}
<D>__{hi, arthur.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{are you familiar with the expression `i can explain everything'?}
<C>__{older cop 1}
<D>__{out of the car, please.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old batchap getting in and out. this one has no doors, so i'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. which nobody wants...}
<P>__{(to cop 2)}
<D>__{apart from you, cheeky monkey!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a joke! okay, okay.}
<A>__{arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. the bronze bull teeters, a little scarily. he stands, wobbly. his batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses. and, inexplicably, a big red stapler. the younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.}
<C>__{older cop 1}
<D>__{okay, explain everything.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{well. what with having spunked 1.6 million fat alberts on this little runaround, i thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne er do wells? it worked for the billionaire bruce wayne, why not the future billionaire arthur bach templemead? will i have to do traffic school?}
<C>__{older cop 2}
<D>__{how much have you drunk, arthur?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{to use the technical medical term megabloodyshitloads. either that or i've had a stroke! but fret not, i have a designated driver.}
<A>__{the cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing a bearded homeless old man in a crappy 60s `robin' costume.}
<C>__{homeless robin}
<D>__{where's my five thousand dollars?}
<A>__{arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the boy homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize manhattan.}
<C>__{homeless robin}
<D>__{it's lizards! english prick!}
<A>__{arthur hands another wad of cash to cop 1.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i trust this will cover all repairs to new york and any inconvenience to your good selves?}
<A>__{he turns and tries to get back in.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{up up and away! ah, no, that's the other chap.}
<A>__{the bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the batmobile.}
