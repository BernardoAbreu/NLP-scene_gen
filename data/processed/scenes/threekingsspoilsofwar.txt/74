<A>__{they go back to the opening. epps shines a light inside to make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm in. jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his lips like a hungry jackal, as epps twists his arm in the opening. searching...searching... epps' face freezes. he goes perfectly still for a beat, then slowly draws his hand from the opening. it clutches a wooden box. it is similar to jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly bigger. the instant epps sets the box on the ground jaeger smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood. from the splinters pours a river of gold coins. jaeger and epps are too stunned to do anything but look at it.}
