<L>__{interior plastic prison day}
<B>__{a clear plastic hallway}
<A>__{thatis right, plastic. everything we can see walls, ceiling, floor is made, entirely, of thick, clear plastic.}
<T>__{down the hall to:}
<B>__{a thick plastic cell}
<A>__{there, in the middle, at the clear plastic desk, with two clear plastic cups filled with the only thing of color other than the two men in the room. xavier and magneto. they play a friendly game of chess. magneto is notably without his trademark helmet. two casts encase his legs from his logan inflicted injury. xavier is on a modified plastic chair with plastic wheels.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{i wouldnit really have let you die, you know. i just needed...}
<C>__{xavier}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{magneto thinks for a while; then:}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{doesnit it ever wake you in the middle of the night? the feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law or one just like it and they will come for you and your children? take you all away?}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{it does indeed, max.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{and what do you do when you wake up to that?}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.}
<A>__{he stares right at magneto. xavier makes a move, magneto counters. xavier moves again.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{but you know that it is a war, old friend. and to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs, by any means necessary. and for that reason, i will always have the advantage. no matter how you trap me, how i am contained }
<A>__{chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation xavier's white pieces slowly surrounding magnetois black king.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{ i will always find an escape.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{and i will always be there, old friend.}
<A>__{and with that, xavier places his queen gently down, taking away a knight.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{check.}
<A>__{just then, the door to the cell opens. a guard waits. magneto and xavier stare at one another before xavier turns and wheels himself out of the room. the door closes behind him, leaving magneto alone with his plastic chess set in his plastic cell. and magneto looks at the pieces before him. something occurs to him. he smiles a wicked smile. and his rook levitates, despite its properties, moving across the board and toppling xavier's king.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{and mate.}
<B>__{black}
