<L>__{interior apartment}
<A>__{on lenny, at the table. he dabs his finger in the blood on the ice pack and writes the number on the table top.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{2 2 0 3. got it. stay on her.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{i intend to.}
<A>__{lenny punches end. mace looks at the number written in blood on the white formica. her eyes ratchet up, boring into lenny. not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{okay, we gotta get over there.}
<P>__{(opens the bag)}
<D>__{can you borrow a dress from cecile or something }
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{whatya mean? we're going! tran's gonna do her right there unless }
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny... shutup. just park your mouth and listen. it's a set up. think about it! why's he been sending you tapes? to freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. this guy's bent enough to think of that.}
<A>__{lenny nods, hearing what she is saying.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{that sounds right.}
<P>__{(but it changes nothing)}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<A>__{he reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of "faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the suit. mace's frustration explodes as anger. she grabs his shoebox full of tapes. holds them up to him.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{you gonna get yourself killed for this? this toxic waste bitch!}
<A>__{she dumps the box of tapes on the floor. she starts stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into junk.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?!}
<A>__{lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to stop her, push her away. they struggle for a pathetic, tragic moment. mace snaps. she grabs him by the lapels and swings him around, slamming him back against a wall.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny! this is your life, lenny! right here. right now. this is realtime... not playback. real... time. time to get real. understand what i'm saying... she doesn't love you. maybe she did once, i don't know, but she doesn't now. these are used emotions. it's time to trade them in.}
<A>__{mace's tone becomes more gentle. we see that her outburst is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny, memories were meant to fade. they're designed that way for a reason.}
<A>__{lenny seems to crumple. he knows he has to let go. but it is so painful.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{have you ever been in love with somebody who didn't return that love?}
<A>__{mace gives him a look like, jeez lenny, are you dumb sometimes.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah. lenny. i have.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it didn't stop you from loving them. right? or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{and it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. did it?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no. it didn't.}
<A>__{lenny's eyes are brimming with tears. he makes no attempt to hide it... doesn't brush them away.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i worked vice, narcotics... violent crimes... and i saw every known depravity. i was lost, mace. in outer darkness. then i busted this strung out little teeny hooker. when i met faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. another lost soul.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{you never told me.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{but she was different. there was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. it was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. i helped her. and i promised her that i'd always be there... to protect her.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{see? it's not about what's in her head. it's what's in mine. i can't let go of the promise. it's... like... it's all i have left.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<A>__{mace takes his face in her hands. she kisses him lightly on the cheek, where the tear track is.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{come on, lenny. let's go to a party.}
