<L>__{exterior commerce street lawson, california day}
<A>__{pete and stanton walk along commerce street, the main drag through the center of the small town. lawson is a bit run down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit. despite that, there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar all american feel. several of the people walking along the street take notice of pete and nod to stanton, who nods back.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{they all know you?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{'course they all know me. and i know all them. town's got my name, don't it?}

<B>__{two faded gold stars}
<A>__{in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered black crepe. two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off to war and didn't come back. stanton notes pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.}

<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{all told, this little town gave sixty two of its finest to the war. seventeen of 'em at normandy alone. more'n its share, i should say. got us a letter from president truman. city council commissioned a war memorial. been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years. town never had the heart to put it up. place just hasn't been the same since the war.}

<A>__{and they head across the street.}
