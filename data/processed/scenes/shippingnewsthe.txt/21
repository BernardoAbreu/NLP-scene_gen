<A>__{bunny on the ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding out a vintage gameboy. she wears clean clothes, freshly washed hair, and a comfortable smile.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{and kisses her, lightly, on the lips.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{she kisses him back, much harder, on the mouth. the lopsided grin of a practicing imp.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{hi, too. that for me?}
<A>__{we hadn't seen them, hidden beside his leg. a bunch of daisies. he gives them to her. like her best beau.}

<D>__{petal went to florida. she'll be back soon.}
<A>__{he looks in her eyes. shakes his head. no.}

<D>__{petal can't come back, she's dead. you know dead. like the turtle.}
<A>__{she drills his eyes. calm as a moose.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{we found the turtle. and they found nestor. did you find petal?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you never do. but she always comes back.}
