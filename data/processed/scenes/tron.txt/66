<A>__{hovering over the game grid. we see sark in his feet sockets, his hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. a buzzing noise fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering into awful shape. we see the stretched out face dissolving into the cylinder of the mcp.}

<D>__{i've got a little challenge for you, sark a new recruit. he's a tough case, but i want him treated in the usual manner. train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{you've got it. i've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{he's not any kind of program, sark. he's a user.}
<A>__{sark looks up, shocked.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{a user?}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{that's right. he pushed me...in the other world. somebody pushes me, i push back. so i brought him down here ... what's the matter, sark? you look nervous.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{well, i it's just i don't know, a user, i mean... users wrote us. a user even wrote you...}

<A>__{the circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see sark weaken.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{wait...i need that...}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{then pull yourself together. get this clown trained. i want him in the games until he dies playing. acknowledge.}
