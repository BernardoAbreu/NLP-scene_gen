<L>__{exterior felled trees wrapped in plastic evening}
<A>__{della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped tree. she listens hard, tries to fathom which direction he's coming from. his voice drifts in and out of proximity like he's pacing around in circles. his voice has changed he's dropped the gangster schtick.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{there's only you and me, now.}
<A>__{maybe, if he wanders into the right position, she can sneak up on him from behind. she rakes about in the dirt looking for a rock or a stick. then she remembers something, sticks her hand in her pocket, half smiles.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i saw a little trail of your blood back there. you must be hurt.}
<A>__{della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find it's still bleeding.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i'm hurting too. i think you busted up my collarbone.}
<A>__{his black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i know you can hear me, della.}
<A>__{chuckie sniffs.}
<D>__{chuckie? i can smell your blood, your sweat. i know you're close.}
<A>__{chuckie's eyes glint in the darkness.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{after what went down tonight, we got a special bond.}
<A>__{della listens, transfixed. his dark shape beckons to her.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{may as well come out now, della.}
<A>__{she doesn't move. she watches him pace around trying to work out where she is. he pulls out a pack of cigarettes, taps one out, lights it. inhales. exhales.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i will save one for you, for when you decide to come out.}
<A>__{he inhales again, exhales. he laughs admiringly.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you're one tough bitch.}
<A>__{the tone of his voice begins to change.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{and that's hot, hell yeah.}
<A>__{frustration breaks through his voice. she can see his shadowy form moving through the darkness towards her. he stops.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{and they're really cute.}
<A>__{chuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead right in between the plastic wrapped trees. della freezes. they? chuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{twins huh? terri and tammi.}
<A>__{della doesn't move. terrified.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i bet you could use that cigarette now della honey?}
<P>__{(he chuckles)}
<D>__{a woman's purse can tell her whole life story!}
<A>__{della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in his jacket. he empties the contents out onto the dirt.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{now i know where they are living, i'm thinking i may stop by after and say hello.}
<A>__{della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates. but she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to give him the satisfaction. we move in closer on chuckie. he's looking right at where she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{they wouldn't know a damn thing about what happened to mommy while she was out, would they, della?}
<A>__{we move in on della. her knuckles are blue white and her eyes are blazing. rage explodes in her. she doesn't even realize that she is shouting till she's done.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i'm going to kill you.}
<A>__{chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{i figured that would help you find your voice!}
<A>__{della crouches further in behind the felled trees. why the hell did she shout? she could have been hiding anywhere. now he must know for sure where she is.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{don't worry. i would never touch them. it's wrong to hurt kids! right, della?}
<A>__{she clamps her mouth closed. chuckie continues waltzing toward her, stops about twelve feet away. he stares in between the felled trees like he has x ray vision.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{the game's over.}
<A>__{chuckie laughs.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you won!}
<A>__{sadness creeps into his voice.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you took him from me...he was only seventeen years old. and all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. and he never saw it. no, he never got to go.}
<A>__{chuckie's grief sits like a stone in his throat.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{they're all gone now.}
<A>__{chuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. he hocks long and deeply in his throat. but whatever it is he can't spit it out. he rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you know the movie "clockwork orange"?}
<A>__{della looks puzzled. yeah, and?}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{well, they were my droogies, della.}
<A>__{chuckie sighs.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{chances are they would of turned on me anyway, just like in the movie.}
<A>__{chuckie paces around, deep in thought.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{none of them was real ass outlaw. no, not in the way you are. you're the real deal, lady.}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i was already thinking about cutting some of em loose, getting a new style posse together.}
<A>__{della's head is spinning.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{how's about it, you and me?}
<A>__{this can't be real. has he lost his mind? she utters under her breath.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{give me a break.}
<A>__{chuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. she cringes.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{monday night mechanics. tuesday pilates. wednesday spanish. thursday, i wish....}
<A>__{he closes the diary.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{face it, della. you ain't no suburban housewife.}
<A>__{chuckie's eyes dart around in the darkness.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{so you bought into the big lie, even tried to live it. who could blame you? husband, kids, security, every woman's dream, but not yours, della. you know there ain't no such thing as security.}
<A>__{he coughs some more.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{but i'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. i reckon i know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. blasting out of podunk without never looking back. feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. taking what you want from life. and wasting anyone who stands in your way. right, della?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes like she's seeing it all behind them.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{don't say you ain't thought about it. if it's in your blood, it's in your blood for all time.}
<A>__{a longing sigh sneaks out.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you had yourself fooled, della.}
<A>__{a single tear runs down her cheek.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{shit, lady, you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools.}
<A>__{she opens her eyes.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you can't go back to your old life. no way. it's all over for that. kaboom.}
<A>__{she doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{hooking up with me's about the best chance you got.}
<A>__{he sounds deadly serious, seductive even. she's lost in some kind of trance, looking like she just might believe him. can she possibly be believing this?}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i bet you're on the outs with your old man.}
<A>__{she inhales sharply.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{when we pick up your kids, we can waste him if you like.}
<A>__{she holds the breath in.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i can do it. or you can if you're ready.}
<A>__{della exhales, responds. she seems lost to us.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i want...}
<A>__{but she doesn't finish the sentence. she rises slowly from between the plastic wrapped trees. a momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. then, their eyes meet, like for the first time. it catches them both by surprise. he smiles.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{leave the tools.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i already did.}
<A>__{he shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see where she is walking. della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the stumps. she heads towards him, slowly, deliberately. chuckie's hands are by his sides. she stops a few feet away from him. she can see him up close. the clearest view of him yet. they both look like they've been to hell.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{hell of a night, huh?}
<A>__{he lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to point up through the trees and into the sky between them.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i was only going to the mall for some christmas wrapping paper.}
<A>__{chuckie smiles.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{shit happens.}
<A>__{they stare at one another, all alone in the night. a knowing moment stretches between them. she notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his collarbone.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{what now?}
<A>__{chuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral grin.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{i wanted to look you in the eye before i kill you.}
<A>__{della doesn't react. he brings up his hand, gun clutched, pointed and ready. della surprises him and us.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{that's what i figured.}
<A>__{she nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{huey there, going to help?}
<A>__{chuckie is puzzled.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{huey? huey's ....}
<A>__{he glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as he turns his head. it's enough. della slips the flare out of her pocket and opens it in his face. before he even has time to react she leaps at him with all the spring left in her legs. her fingers close around the wrist with the gun. the flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them. she crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken. it makes the ugly noise of sinew tearing.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{christ!}
<A>__{she tumbles him down to the december ground and wraps her legs tight around him. tight like a lover. she grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound. he cries out, thrashes about. she keeps her body melded to his, grinding her chin even deeper. he wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone. they roll across the dirt. he whispers, low and close to her.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you're even better than i thought.}
<A>__{he pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound. she tries to pull away but he only presses harder. neither can break away. it's unclear who's got the gun. they roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up. but he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock. and she has the gun. they look at each other. he smiles. he makes for the gun. she fires into his chest, just once, it's enough. his legs release. he slumps back. blood darkens his shirt. gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle. his body surrenders to death. she stares down at him. a queasy silent moment passes. she stares at the gun in her hands. it feels so heavy, so unreal. his dead eyes stare. she reaches over and closes them gently. and she's light headed, so light headed she could just float away. somehow she stands up. she looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. she sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood. she retrieves it. uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of tammis little thoughtful face and terri's mischievous one look back at her. she snaps the locket closed. she searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. she sticks everything in her purse. she almost misses her pack of cigarettes. we see them half buried under the dirt. she scans the area once more finds them. the pack is empty but she takes it anyway. it's time to go home.}
