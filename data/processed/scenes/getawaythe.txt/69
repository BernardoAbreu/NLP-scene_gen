<L>__{interior station wagon day}
<A>__{dialogue comes on the radio describing the robbery. $750,000 stolen.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we got between four and five.}
<A>__{carol starts to open the bag and count. doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead. they are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic. doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(now noticing the road)}
<D>__{doc...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{i see it...}
<A>__{on the road ahead highway patrolmen have formed a traffic barricade. several cars and trucks are being waved through the check pointerior wearing sunglasses and stetson hats, the uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle. doc analyzes the situation without changing expression he slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly passing vehicles. she turns, starts to reach into the back. doc gently catches her arm, preventing her from moving further.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{they're looking for three men... remember?}
<A>__{a young officer looks into the cab of the pickup, then glances at the empty flatbed. another patrolman flanks the other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. several patrol cars, fully loaded with additional officers, are parked nearby. the pickup truck is waved through. the station wagon rolls up to the check pointerior doc rolls down his window. he smiles and nods to the young patrolman.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<A>__{carol studies the officer on her side of the car through the closed window... the officer peers back at her then into the rear seat. the station wagon is waved ahead without a second glance by the patrolman; doc accelerates away from the roadblock... after a moment, doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.}
