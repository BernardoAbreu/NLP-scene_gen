<A>__{a bright morning. a huge clergyman dressed in black is staring down at jane, blocking out the sun. we see him from her pov; his expansive chest, dramatic facial hair, huge flared nostrils, frowning brows. he is brockelhurst, the epitome of grim.}
<C>__{brocklehurst}
<D>__{there is no sight so sad and so deplorable as that of a wicked little girl. do you know, jane eyre, where the wicked go after death?}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no sir.}
<C>__{brocklehurst}
<D>__{what must you do to avoid it?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i must keep in good health and not die.}
<A>__{mrs reed is by the fireside in an ultra feminine dress. she puts down her tea cup in irritation.}
