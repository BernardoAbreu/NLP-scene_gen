<D>__{you know where i am if you need me.}
<A>__{he walks out, closing the door after him. bud dejectedly turns off the overhead light, kicks out the plug of the christmas tree lights, trudges into the bedroom. fran is fast asleep. bud picks up her dress, gets a hanger, drapes the dress over it, hangs it from the door. an early morning chill has invaded the room, and bud switches an the electric blanket to keep fran warm. then he slumps into a chair beside the bed, looks at fran compassionately. the light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the grayish room. bud just sits there, watching fran.}
