<A>__{seth enters a room of people dancing to hip hop. he notices all the girls are drinking mike's hard lemonade, and then locates a cooler full of it across the dance area. he tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. a hot, sorority type woman drunk out off her ass dances over to him and starts grinding against his leg. he doesn't know how to react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the girl.}
