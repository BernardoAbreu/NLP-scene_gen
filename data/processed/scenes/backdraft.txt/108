<L>__{interior theatre building night}
<A>__{brian follows rimgale down from the office into the vast theatre. walls hiss and spit. brian's surprised to see his former engine mates there, tromping and crunching their way through broken glass, their flashlights like dancing fireflies. tim passes by.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey, tim.}
<A>__{everybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{brian.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{check the wall for burn patterns.}
<A>__{and rimgale's off to another room. brian turns and looks at the wall. it's endless.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(to tim)}
<D>__{so, you surviving without me?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{swayzak's not my boss.}
<A>__{silence. brian looks over the wall. a dirty puddle separates him from it.}
<C>__{grindle}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{ooooh, like the tie. love the tie.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh? i would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know...}
<A>__{grindle stares at him a beat, then wordlessly steps into the muck and pulls free a section of wall, dropping it on the ground in front of brian. santos and grindle look at each other.}
<C>__{santos}
<D>__{uh, brian, if you're lookin' for smoke patterns, there's some good ones over here.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah? where?}
<C>__{grindle}
<P>__{(as brian walks over)}
<D>__{little to the right... further... further... right behind there. hey, could you hand me that pike pole?}
<A>__{there's a pike pole leaning against the wall. brian pulls it aside. splash the pole had been supporting a small, sagging piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty gallons of murky, putrid black water all over brian's civvys. nobody laughs.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{sorry, maybe that wasn't it after all.}
<A>__{stephen appears around the corner. sees what's happened.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that's just about enough, guys, okay?}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{see ya around, brian.}
<A>__{they leave. brian stands there, humiliated.}
<C>__{axe}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{what the hell's the matter with you, huh? you're steppin' in the shit again. you could've done it. you don't want this.}
<P>__{(the suit 'n tie)}
<D>__{wake up, kid.}
<A>__{brian burns with shame and anger as adcox walks away. stephen hands brian a towel.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{here. dry yourself off.}
<A>__{brian snatches it from him. glares at his brother.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{thanks for the insight.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{brian, look }
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{just leave me alone, okay?}
<A>__{brian walks away. stephen calls after him.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey, bri... rimgale's okay. i don't get half the shit he's talking about, but then everybody says the same thing about me. who the hell knows?}
