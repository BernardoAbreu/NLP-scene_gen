<A>__{the hallway is chilly susan shivers. she's about to start walking down when she looks up, noticing the lights at the top floor flickering. a wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell with an eerie roar. susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down... then we hear the scraping sound again. startled, susan pauses and looks down, over the railing. there's nothing there but the sound continues, growing louder, like something is moving up towards her.}
