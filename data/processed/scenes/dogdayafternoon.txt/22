<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{much as before. sonny steps out. the guns start to come up.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{put them down.}
<A>__{the cops lower their weapons. moretti comes out on the sidewalk. he's eating an ice cream bar, and stands seemingly at ease, an island of calm control in a storm of passion about to be let loose. the cops are always about to explode.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{sonny, ya want somethin'?}
<A>__{sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium size dark haired man who has been standing among people behind the barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed right across the street towards sonny. he catches everybody so by surprise he is already on sonny before anyone can do more than start to yell at him to stop. sonny, himself, can't believe it! he is slammed to the ground and the man begins to punch him and beat him viciously. cops charge in and with great difficulty pull him off. yelling on the radio network; tv reporters and the crowd up and screaming for blood!}
<B>__{close angle}
<A>__{as moretti steps in. sonny gets up, dazed. the man goes on kicking and fighting cops...}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{who the hell is that?}

<C>__{moretti}

<P>__{(turns to sonny)}
<D>__{you okay, sonny? boy, he hung a couple good ones on you there!}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(from door; alarmed)}
<D>__{sal wants to see sonny. he says he'll shoot unless he can see sonny.}
<A>__{he means sal. sonny, dazed and bleeding, reels to the door and calls in... sal now stands alone behind 3rd pillar.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's okay, sal.}
<A>__{he turns back to face moretti, sylvia, mulvaney.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(continuing; hurt, wondering)}
<D>__{he wanted to kill me!}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{it's okay, you got a lot of protection.}
<A>__{close sonny looking around, bewildered, the crowd is yelling and now it sounds unfriendly. he is really shaken up... he shakes himself stops that line and starts over in a business like tone.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i want a helicopter to get outa here! and a jet to take us to...}
<P>__{(cagey)}
<D>__{...wherever we want to go. outa the country, so no little jets. a big one with a bar and a piano lounge.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{i don't know, sonny. i don't know if the helicopters can land in here. i will have to check it out. i got superiors, unnerstan? they don't always see eye to eye with me. i will do what i can.}
<A>__{sonny looks him in the eye. suddenly he makes kissing motions and sounds with his lips. we know what he's referring to: he thinks moretti's trying to fuck him over.}
<C>__{moretti}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sonny, be reasonable!}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i want to see my wife. i want you to bring her down here.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{okay, what do you give me?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{the girl hostages.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{nothin' doin'. i give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.}
<C>__{moretti}
<P>__{(kiss)}
<D>__{i will see what they'll do.}
<A>__{sonny smiles and pantomimes kissing.}
<C>__{moretti}
