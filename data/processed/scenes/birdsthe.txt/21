<D>__{without any clothes on?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{with all my clothes on! the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. anything they said...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...}

<D>__{...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, that's the truth. but i was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{sure. do you really know annie hayworth?}
<C>__{melanie}

<P>__{(pause)}

<D>__{so you didn't go to school together.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{and you didn't come up here to see her.}
<C>__{melanie}

<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you were lying.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, i was lying.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie, too?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i wrote the letter.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it said, "dear mr. brenner, i think you need those lovebirds, after all. they may help your personality." that's what it said.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{but you tore it up.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{melanie}

<D>__{like jumping into a fountain in rome!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i told you what happened in rome!}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{do you expect me to believe...?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i don't give a damn what you believe!}
<A>__{angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when mitch catches it in his hands.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i'd still like to see you.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i think it could be fun.}
<A>__{close shot melanie pulling the door shut.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that might have been good enough in rome last summer. but it's not good enough now.}
<A>__{close shot mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{it is for me.}
<A>__{close shot melanie}
<C>__{melanie}

<A>__{close shot melanie}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(angrily sarcastic)}
<D>__{i thought you knew! i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! good night!}
<A>__{med. shot the car as it pulls away. mitch yanks his hands back from the door. close shot mitch as he watches the car leave. long shot the road the car turns the bend and disappears. empty road. only the long line of telephone poles and wires and... something strange on the wires.}
<B>__{close shot mitch}
<A>__{his attention caught by the poles and wires. close shot the wires hundreds of birds sitting on them. med. shot mitch standing and watching. a wind blows off the water. he shivers suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.}
