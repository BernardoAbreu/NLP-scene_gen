<L>__{exterior the dresden parking lot out back night}
<A>__{the swingers are leaving through the back door. the doorway is congested with another group of guys who are entering. a bald guy with a goatee brushes by sue.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{watch where you're going, asshole.}
<C>__{bald guy}
<D>__{what'd you say, bitch?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i said watch where you're going, bitch!}
<A>__{that's it. now they're squaring off in the empty parking lot. all the bald guy's boys fall in behind him. all the swingers fall in behind sue. the swingers are not happy with sue at all. the two cliques contrast each other in every way. the bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck tattoo thrown in for good measure. baggy denim and boots. pot leaves and pumas. long, heavy key chains. vintage 1994 whiteboy faux gansta. they do, however, look big and mean next to our boys. the early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the same fear factor, but the boys do look classy. the word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until... sue pulls a pistol out of his belt. everyone is scared. especially the swingers.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{now what, bitch? now who's the bitch, bitch?}
<A>__{the bald guys hold up their hands and slowly back up to their ride.}
<C>__{bald guy}
<D>__{hey, man. i'm the bitch. i'm your bitch, okay? we're just gonna leave. okay? i'm the bitch. i'm such a bitch, i can't even begin to tell you...}
<A>__{they jump in the car and speed away. sue belts the gun and stands tall like clinterior}
<C>__{trent}

<C>__{sue}
<D>__{... people get carjacked...}

<D>__{... oh yeah, like "cypress hill" was gonna do anything...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you live in such a fantasy world...}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{what about you, mikey? at least i got balls. you're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{... it was six months, and she didn't dump...}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{... whatever. you're like a whining little woman. big deal. you got a fuckin' number. whoopee! you'll fuck it up...}
<C>__{trent}
