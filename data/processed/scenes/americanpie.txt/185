<L>__{exterior east great falls high night}
<A>__{kevin still sits there. jim, oz, and finch come out of the school. slowly they walk up to kevin.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{...guess what?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{kevin, come on, the bus to stifler's is gonna be here soon.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<A>__{a beat as the guys don't know what to say. kevin's speech is halting, downbeat.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{this isn't how i wanted things to turn out. making the pact wasn't just about getting laid. it was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated. but now i've just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what? i don't even know. all i managed to do was fuck up our friendship.}
<A>__{a beat. oz shrugs.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{i still think you're okay.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so do i, kev.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{me too. for the most part.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{nah. fuck, you guys are right, i don't know what i'm doing. i mean i'm acting like i've got it all together tonight. but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her. and i don't know what i'm gonna say. so now it's like, maybe i will just wimp out on the whole thing.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{come on man. tonight is the night. we're finally going to a post prom party on the lake. we've been waiting to do this for the last four years. why else are we still friends with stifler? you gotta go.}
<A>__{a beat as kevin ponders this.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{and by the way, sherman didn't even get laid.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{he didn't?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{nope. he pissed himself.}
<A>__{the guys laugh as kevin is puzzled. they are suddenly illuminated by the glare of headlights. a charter bus pulls in front of the school.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there it is. i want to grab my bag. oh, and my date.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{come on, kevin. vicky's looking for you.}
<A>__{jim holds out a helping hand. kevin looks at it. grabs it, and jim pulls him up.}
