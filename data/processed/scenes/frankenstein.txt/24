<L>__{int grand ballroom night (6 years later)}
<A>__{to reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and spectacle as a hundred dancers swirl about the floor in a breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble (note: the music here should be our movie's distinctive waltz love theme, which will reoccur later.) victor and elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about them in a blur. now 24, he's in the prime of manhood. elizabeth, 23, is a drop dead beauty radiating poise and intelligence. they're so right for each other, so beautiful together, your heart could break just looking at them. justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. she's at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone would ask her to dance. william, now 7, scampers to her side. she stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. waltzing couples swirl past them.}

<D>__{auntie justine, papa said i could have a sweet.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{you can. but not before dinner.}
<A>__{the music ends amidst applause. the men bow to the ladies, the ladies curtsy in return. victor escorts elizabeth off the dance floor. elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{you dance so beautifully together.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and you look so lovely.}
<A>__{they share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. the orchestra recommences. the music is lush. justine looks hopefully to victor, keeping her tone light:}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{victor? spare me one dance?}
<A>__{elizabeth catches victor's eye.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{go on, ask her. please. i'm quite out of breath.}
<A>__{victor gallantly offers his arm. justine takes it, lighting up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ... ...and they begin to dance. she's glowing. this is a big moment for her. but they've hardly begun, when... ...ting ting ting, victor's father is tapping a champagne glass with a knife. the dancers stop. the orchestra falls silent. justine hides her disappointment as servants pass among the guests with glasses of champagne.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{my friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast.}
<A>__{shouts of assent. victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{to victor. my son. who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen... and then re read them, which seemed excessive even to me.}
<P>__{(the guests roar with laughter)}
<D>__{drape yourself in glory, my boy. study well. when you return, you return a man of medicine. i will then be honored to call you "colleague."}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{but never your equal.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{no. you'll surpass me.}
<A>__{applause and roars of approval. the drinks are tossed back. victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.}
