<A>__{the head kgb officer is there. the head kgb officer has a file opened on his desk. in it are photographs of ramirez jumping out of the apartment in libya. none of the photographs show his face clearly so there's no way of telling who it is. just then the aide comes in and hands a telex to the head kgb officer.}
