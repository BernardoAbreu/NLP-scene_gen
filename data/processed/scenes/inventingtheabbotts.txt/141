<C>__{doug}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{a boiling water kettle starts to whistle (o.s.) jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. there is a soft knock on the front door. doug goes to answer it. he opens the door and finds pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. he is pleasantly surprised; pam is distant, slightly off balance.}
