<L>__{exterior frank lloyd wright house day}
<A>__{martin's p.o.v. of a lovely young couple on the front porch of a mid sized wright home... perhaps that could be him if things were different, but for now it feels like along shot. paul is hawking the house to them out of earshot.}
<C>__{southtec guard }
<D>__{well, we do what we have to do if we find you on the property. but we don't really enforce the law, we execute company policy for homeowners.}
<B>__{martin and the guard}
<A>__{standing in the driveway.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{so when are you authorized to use deadly force?}
<C>__{southtec guard}
<D>__{well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service police and whatnot. but our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? this badge doesn't mean that i am a peace officer.}
<A>__{the woman turns at martin and smiles. martin smiles back.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{so it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. that badge is just the badge of your company. if i look suspicious on your customers' property well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... to shoot me.}
<C>__{southtec guard}
<D>__{to shoot you. correct.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how did you get this job?}
<C>__{southtec guard}

<D>__{we'll talk soon.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(much hand gesturing)}
<D>__{you'll be raising your new family in a work of art. a work of art in a work of art.}
<A>__{paul looks at martin and the guard, inviting them into the sell.}
<C>__{southtec guard}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll be very happy.}
<A>__{all look to martin....}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{when my time comes, if it ever does, i want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you...}
<A>__{all are confused. martin thumbs to the guard.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...and you'll be safe here...}
<A>__{paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.}
