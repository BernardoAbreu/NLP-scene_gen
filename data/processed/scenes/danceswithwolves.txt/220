<A>__{the lodge flap is still closed. but now it is covered in sunshine. smiles a lot, worm and otter are just across the way, bundled now against the chill of oncoming winter. they're watching too. smiles a lot is standing next to worm, otter is on his haunches. both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat as they talk nonchalantly.}
