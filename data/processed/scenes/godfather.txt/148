<L>__{int nite: funeral parlor embalming room (spring 1946)}
<A>__{they carry the corpse to one of the tables in the embalming room. then bonasera turns to see another man step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly. it is don corleone. he walks up to bonasera, very close, without speaking. his cold eyes looking directly at the frightened undertaker. then, after a long gaze:}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{well my friend, are you ready to do me this service?}
<A>__{bonasera nods. the don moves to the corpse on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the other men leave them alone.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{what do you wish me to do?}
<C>__{don corleone}
<P>__{(staring at the table)}
<D>__{i want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. i do not want his mother to see him as he is.}
<A>__{he draws down the gray blanket. bonasera lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees: the bullet smashed face of sonny corleone.}
