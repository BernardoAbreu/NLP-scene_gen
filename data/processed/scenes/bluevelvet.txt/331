<A>__{a songbird sings in a tree. we are in a beautiful park. slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view. the hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward dorothy. she is laughing. when the boy gets within arms reach they embrace. we move close to dorothy's smiling face. tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear bobby vinton sing the last lines of his song. "and i still can see blue velvet through my tears." blue velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.}
