<C>__{saul}
<D>__{we're not gonna have to kill him, are we? i don't think i could do that.}
<A>__{dale stares at the almost motionless red.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{maybe we could talk him into killing himself, or, like, make him promise not to tell.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, we have to find out what he knows.}
<C>__{red}

<D>__{wait! i...i...}
<A>__{dale grabs a potted plant.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{dale swings the plant back to strike red. the pot flies off the plant and dale smashes the dirt covered roots of the plant against red's face.}

<A>__{dale and saul exchange very worried looks.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{listen, i }
<A>__{dale swings the plant upwards, prepared to strike red again.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{who's his competition?}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i made a gravity bong here once. i know where his duct tape is.}
<A>__{saul runs off. dale puts on saul's backpack and looks at the battered red moaning on the floor.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{come on, let's tape this piece of shit up.}
<A>__{dale pulls red's hands behind his back. saul is picking at the tape.}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i can't find the, oh...wait...}
<A>__{saul rips open the duct tape. he quickly binds red's hands and feet. suddenly, there's a knock at the door. they stop, silent. knock. knock. knock. red starts thrashing and trying to scream.}
<C>__{saul }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{shit. they're actually here to kill him.}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{thanks, red.}
