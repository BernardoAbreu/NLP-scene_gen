<A>__{parker looks annoyed he doesn't like deviations from procedure but after a moment of indecision, he sets the file folder on tate's desk and walks away. tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside. bored, looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents; routine money vouchers for equipment, supplies, etc. tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.}

<D>__{what the hell is this...?}
