<D>__{i know this is a rejection letter. i can't open this. i can't be rejected today. i take rejection so personally.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i bet it's good news.}
<A>__{she opens the envelope. peeks inside. no letter. just the smallest post it note flutters out on to the ground. colette picks it up.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{"sorry. not interested." i knew it. how can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper?}
<A>__{colette folds the post it note in half and then in quarters. holding it in her hand, she begins to chant. alan holds on to her hand and pats her on the back. good husband.}
