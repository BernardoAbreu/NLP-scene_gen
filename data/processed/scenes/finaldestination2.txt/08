<L>__{interior a room continuous}
<A>__{kat, eugene, nora, tim, and rory sit in a large room, waiting to give statements. unlike evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take?}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{if i don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room apart.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{those poor people. to think it would've been us if not for...}
<A>__{pan over to reveal kimberly. she's still in shock, her mind far away. thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{tell me again how it started.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{like i said, it was like i was there. i remember everything. the sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on shaina's face...}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{do you remember what triggered it all?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{the log truck...and everybody i guess. everyone was driving like a maniac. and somehow i knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.}
<A>__{something clicks for thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly, like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you knew? you just mean a hunch, right? a bad vibe, maybe?}
<A>__{the other drivers stare at kimberly.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{more than that. all the songs on the radio were about car crashes. some kid's banging toy cars together.}
<P>__{(lookin g at her)}
<D>__{she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.}
<P>__{(points to rory)}
<D>__{his car was leaking oil all over the road.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{hey, don't be knockin' the chevette.}
<A>__{but the others listen intently now. especially kat, who spies her headset buried deep in her purse.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{billboards about accidents. kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. it all felt...just wrong. just like...}
<P>__{(swallows; hesitates)}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{kimberly sighs and looks down. the room becomes eerily silent, except for the flicker of a florescent light.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i know this sounds crazy...but you all heard about flight 180, right? the kid who got off the plane?}
<A>__{thomas' eyes widen then a startling crash as rory, le aning back in his chair, tips over. thomas rolls his eyes as rory grins sheepishly and picks himself up.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you mean alex browning.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{...my premonition was just like his.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, you must have read about that kid who had a dream about a plane crash so he got his buddies off the plane? then the thing blew up just like in the dream?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{maybe...}
<A>__{eugene sees nora and tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{but this is where it starts to get freaky. so a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'cause when your number's up, it's up, right? some people said death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead.}
<A>__{everyone tenses up.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{well, not quite all of them. clear rivers checked herself into a padded room at stoneybrook.}
<A>__{kimberly, affected, looks to thomas for confirmation.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{you do believe me, don't you?}
<A>__{bang! everyone jumps as detective suby pounds on the door and opens it.}
<C>__{detective suby}
<D>__{officer burke? could i see you in here?}
