<D>__{because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because i myself intend to be very active in every phase of the american negro struggle for human rights, i have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. in the past i thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the honorable elijah muhammad, that day is over. from now on i speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. internal differences within the nation of islam forced me out of it. i did not leave of my own free will. but now that it has happened, i intend to make the most of it. now that i have more independence of action, i intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. i do not pretend to be a divine man, but i do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. i am not educated, nor am i an expert in any particular field, but i am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. i'm not out to fight other negro leaders or organizations. we must find a common solution, to a common problem. i am going to organize and head a new mosque in new york city, known as the muslim mosque, inc. this gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. our political philosophy will be black nationalism. our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. the muslim mosque, inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. whites can help us, but they can't join us. there can be no black white unity until there is first some black unity.}
