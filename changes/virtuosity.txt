<ACTION>__{Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle. The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997. Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the horizon. Making the sky look peculiar. The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop, watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.}

Including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians. Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department. The guy in the lead is}

Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp. Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background.

<ACTION>__{a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars. The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look. In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world. The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime. The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension, anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production.

Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system. The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds. Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own. But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR}
<ACTION>__{To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual reality, not the real world. Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main console. Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7. The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11 seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM. Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE. One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor. Intently following the action on screen. Studying it clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s. She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common with the other observers. The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the Presidentiallyappointed Crime Czars Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to production.}

You can now see the faces of the participants: Parker and John. Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his virtual rendering: His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a filthy prison uniform. John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as cleancut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is convulsing. Violently. His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly. Frightening.}

He is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for John's life. John's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet. They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.}

You now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is now empty. She left a while ago. Cox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child.

The Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly. Passionately. Brilliantly. Getting the absolute best from the members of the orchestra. The musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to their musical limit. As the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet music on the podium, you notice seven small, HIGH-FREQUENCY SENSORS above an upcoming musical measure. The sensors are wired together.

Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing. Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience members run in every direction. The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist. Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots at Sid 6.7. Sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a clean shot. Neither can Parker.

Madison crumples to the street. Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6.7's head. BOOM! BOOM! Two hits. Two head wounds. Sid 6.7 falls behind a truck, losing his weapon.
