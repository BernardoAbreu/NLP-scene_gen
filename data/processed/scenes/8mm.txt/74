<L>__{interior mathews house, kitchen morning}
<A>__{welles sits at the kitchen table. mrs. mathews makes coffee. the home's decor is cheap and flowery.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{we weren't religious. we never forced religion down her throat, like i've seen some parents do to their kids. we never made her go to church. but, after mary was gone, that's when i got religious.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{doesn't make much sense, does it? when everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a god, you don't bother. then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. that's when you start going to church.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{we're all like that.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{are you religious?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{you should be.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i've got what i need for my report. there is... there is one thing that bothers me though.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. see, i know a little about missing persons. when kids run, they almost always leave a note. it's guilt. they want to say goodbye.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{there wasn't one. the police looked.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{do you think the police did a good job?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{i don't know. i think so.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it is possible... and i know this isn't something you want to hear. your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. she might have wanted to tell you something...}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{no. you don't have any reason to think that...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{if the police focused their search in her}
<A>__{room, her belongings, well}
<D>__{that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews is getting upset.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{how... how can you say that to me...?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{will you let me look?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{my husband never laid a hand on her. she would have told me... she would have told me...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you're probably right, and i probably won't find anything. i don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. police are just as human as you or i. they could have missed something. they probably didn't.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{wouldn't you rather know?}
<A>__{mrs. mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{go ahead and look if you want. i don't care what you do.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews gets up and walks out of the room.}
