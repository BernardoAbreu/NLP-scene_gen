<A>__{nick paces agitated, with the group:}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ten years he's been planning this? patient people make me nervous. this? this freaks me out.}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{is he serious about confessing? what's his deal, is he crazy?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first degree.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{agreed, but softly. nothing hard ass, no grand standing. kid gloves.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{kid gloves? he's a psycho with a power saw.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child.}
<P>__{(off nick's look)}
<D>__{public sympathy is to be respected and feared. this could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. we can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind.}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{are we pissed off? do we have an ax to grind?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{then stop acting like it.}
<A>__{beat. nick takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay. he got under my skin a little. that's done.}
