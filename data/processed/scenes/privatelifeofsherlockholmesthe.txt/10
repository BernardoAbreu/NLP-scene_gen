<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior baker street day}
<A>__{it is raining. a bus comes down the street, the open top deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{naturally, i don't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine sometimes it was opium, sometimes it was hashish. and once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was no telling how long it would last.}
<L>__{interior living room 221b baker street day}
<A>__{rain beats on the windows. holmes and watson are in the middle of an argument.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now, now, watson you mustn't underestimate your other charms.}
<A>__{he starts into the bedroom.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, i warn you. if you lock yourself in there once more }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i intend to do nothing of the sort.}
<A>__{he takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the washstand, starts back into the living room with it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{not until you replace this needle. it is getting rather blunt.}
<A>__{as watson glares at him, the door opens and mrs. hudson comes bustling in. holmes hides the hypodermic behind his back.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{i made you some tea and cress sandwiches.}
<A>__{she opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull it up.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{mrs. hudson, i want you to pack my bags.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{are you going away for the weekend?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{and beyond. i'm moving out.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{moving out?}
<P>__{(she looks at holmes)}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'm just as surprised as you are.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you heard me, mrs. hudson. and let's not waste any time.}
<A>__{mrs. hudson sighs, exits into watson's bedroom.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{may i be so bold as to ask where you'er going?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i don't know yet. but i intend to resume my practice. i am, after all, a doctor. and quite a competent one, if i say so as shouldn't.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you'll find it very dull snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys }
<A>__{watson is glancing around the room, searching for something.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if you're looking for your medical bag, you hid it under the moorish table.}
<P>__{(as watson crosses to it)}
<D>__{which shows a little more imagination than last time when it was under your bed.}
<A>__{watson picks up the moorish table, disclosing the medical bag, standing on end. he sets the bag down on the fender, opens it.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i will, of course, continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{where am i going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits?}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(taking hypodermic needle out of bag)}
<D>__{here's a fresh needle and here's my farewell present to you.}
<A>__{he takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on the mantel.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{if you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead. but i won't sit by and watch you doing it.}
<A>__{he snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson...}
<A>__{watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door. holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece. he starts pacing. after a moment he stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above.}
