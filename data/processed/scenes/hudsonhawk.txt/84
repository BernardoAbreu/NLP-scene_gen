<L>__{interior a very long, enigmatic hallway}
<A>__{hawk, alex, and anna pass through a set of windowed double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a pitch darkness. a mural of a happy, arm stretched lenin looms above the doors. they give it a a quick glance before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{eighth room down, babe...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{guards come exactly every three minutes....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{three. oh. oh. "side by side."}
<A>__{our trio charges down the hallway.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{"oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{"maybe we're ragged and funny."}
<A>__{they reach a massive spooky door with an odd, ancient lock. they go to work on it. not losing the beat.}
<C>__{hawk and alex}
<D>__{"but we'll travel along, singing a song. side by side..."}
