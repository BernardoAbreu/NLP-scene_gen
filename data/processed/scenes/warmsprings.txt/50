<A>__{roy wheels franklin while tom walks in front of them leading the way.}

<D>__{mrs. roosevelt want to swim?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{mrs. roosevelt doesn't know how.}
<A>__{franklin takes in the surroundings. deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape.}
<L>__{exterior pool day}
<A>__{an immense, t shaped pool rimmed in concrete. the bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth. a mother, eyeing franklin approaching in his wheelchair, comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her children out of the water. aunt sally, an ancient, gaunt, african american woman, stands guard by the edge of the water.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{mr. roosevelt, i'd like you to meet aunt sally.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{aunt sally.}
<C>__{aunt sally}
<D>__{good day, sir. i have towels for you.}
<A>__{roy wheels franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible. tom lends his assistance and both he and roy hoist franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting his feet dangle in the warm water. twisting on his massive arms, franklin lowers himself cautiously.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{now give it a minute. you'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant. the crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water.}
<A>__{franklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom. crushed, all hope drains from his face.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i can't even stand.}
<C>__{aunt sally}
<D>__{well, not yet.}
