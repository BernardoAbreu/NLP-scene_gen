<A>__{he is holding his rifle with both hands straight over his head and he repeats the signal until he sees they have seen him.}
<C>__{jorgensen's voice}
<P>__{(excitedly)}

<L>__{exterior open country full shot the posse with brad in}
<B>__{the distance}
<A>__{as jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way. the other riders follow. med. shot brad rising ground late afternoon he waits grimly until he sees them coming, then wheels his mount and takes off over the hill. full shot the posse as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest. jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay. the other men look down into the long valley on the far side with equally grim expressions.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{call that young fool back!}
<A>__{jorgensen doesn't even seem to hear him. angrily ethan whips out revolver and fires into the air. then he swings his arm in a come back gesture. he rides out ahead then a short distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow. we see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun. ethan goes to the nearest one. a feathered lance is driven into it. he pulls the lance out. mose comes over beside him.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{caddo or kiowa, huh?... ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that!}
<A>__{he hands the lance to mose.}
<C>__{mose}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{ay he... comanch!}
<A>__{brad rides in shrill with anger.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{killed every one an' not for food either... why'd they do a thing like that?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{stealing the cattle was just to pull us out... this here's a murder raid...}
<P>__{(facing jorgensen)}
<D>__{it shapes up to scald out either your place... or my brother's.}
<A>__{jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the miles they have ridden.}
<C>__{jorgensen}
<D>__{mama!... oh please... please no... brad!}
<A>__{and with that one word, jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off... fast. ed nesby and charlie maccorry follow. sam clayton pauses.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{jorgensen's place is closest... if they're not there, we'll come straight on!}
<A>__{then he too rides. martin swings his horse back to where ethan and mose still are standing.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, come on!}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{easy!}
<P>__{(he starts toward his horse)}
<D>__{it's forty miles, sonny... horses can do with some grain and a little rest.}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{comanch generally hits at moonrise.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{moonrise!... it'll be midnight before... i ain't waitin'...!}
<A>__{he wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the others. ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed his horse. mose does the same.}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{wisht it was caddoes... or kiowas...}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{comanche...}
<A>__{ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle.}
