<D>__{...only it's not bloody football !}
<A>__{snap to mac's table, well across the room. drinking giant beers with a large, really fat japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit. the hulk listens with stone attention to mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...it's just that crap americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one!}
<A>__{the guy nods seriously. maybe he's a sumo dude.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why you'd want to bring that foolishness to japan , you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole.}
<C>__{sumo guy }
<D>__{you got cubano this trip?}
<A>__{that he does. mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over. flat against one side is an envelope, which sumo guy palms skillfully, slipping it seamlessly into his pocket as he withdraws a small match box. takes out one long cigar, lights up...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable .}
<A>__{the big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward mac. opening the box, mac sees one match and a small microchip fastened to the cardboard. lights up. slides the match box in his pocket.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{garbage, perhaps. or industrial plastics.}
<A>__{angle...gin still engrossed in her reading. a figure leans down next to her. she startles, slightly. so surprised to see...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{my favorite thing in life. coincidence.}
<A>__{she gives him the great smile.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm staying here, what's your excuse?}
<A>__{and now he smiles. first time ever. a little chilling, the way he does it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{staying here, as well. you are in room...?}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{one thirty eight.}
<A>__{in one motion, he flags the bartender...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{will you send a half bottle of chateau d'yquem '67 to room 138, please? and some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with.}
<A>__{he presses some currency into the barkeep's hand. turning back...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{actually, i was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting spitzweg. until i determined the painting was apparently stolen...}
<A>__{oh. she's shocked. he agrees...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{goes against my grain. the dekooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3. can you get it for 2 and a half?}
<A>__{she looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{and as if he believed her...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{my checkbook is in my safe. you wait here.}
<A>__{his smile evaporates. he is gone before she can say...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay. i will wait here.}
