<A>__{later in the evening. solomon now shares his space with eliza and her children. as the children rest, eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to solomon who lends a sympathetic ear. both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{when i say i had my master's favor, you understand. above even his own wife, i had it. do you know that he built a house for me? built it on the sole condition that i reside there with him. the added promise in time i would be emancipated. and for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.}
<A>__{displaying the finery she still wears:}
<C>__{eliza }
<D>__{silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us. such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl i bore for him. but master berry's daughter...she always looked at me with an unkind nature. she hated emily no matter she and emily were flesh of flesh. as master berry's health failed, she gained power in the household. eventually, i was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed. if i had known what waited; to be sent south? i swear i would not have come here alive.}
<A>__{eliza turns to her children:}
<C>__{eliza }
<D>__{my poor, poor babies.}
