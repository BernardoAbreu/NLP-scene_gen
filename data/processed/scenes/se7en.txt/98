<A>__{envy is particularly gruesome. the devil is seen hovering in the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in a cloak of flames. his arms held high, his right hand grips a sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc. his left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has wrapped itself. he looks down at several pitiful mortals in a pit of fire. the mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones.}
