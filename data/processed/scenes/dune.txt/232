<A>__{a thirty foot baby worm is being lowered into a stone chamber. the chamber is then covered with a wire top. valves are turned and water rushes into the chamber. the worm begins to writhe violently and leap and bang against the bars above. the worm begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it begins to gag. some monks and watermasters quickly drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out using large steel hooks. they hold the worm above a large tub. a watermaster reed man runs a long reed in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.}
