<L>__{exterior of cabin moonlight after the storm}
<A>__{rocklin and dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness. water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near by tree. the sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral. both men re act.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{my team.}
<A>__{almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely and from a distance.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{that's not your team.}
<A>__{he moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by dave.}
<B>__{horse is stomping nervously}
<A>__{and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing. only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider.}
<B>__{rocklin and dave hear the sound of retreating hoof beats}
<A>__{and they can barely make out their quarry riding hell bent toward the deep blackness of the trees. rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing dave close behind. rocklin halts fires again and again. dave fires. the mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night. dave starts after him again. looking back, he sees rocklin has not moved.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{come on }
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{no use he's gone.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{mebbe we winged him.}
<A>__{he starts through the wet grass alone. rocklin turns back toward the cabin. dave ploughing through the grass he has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight embankment leads to the level of the trees. he is just starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. it proves to be a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. it is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. dave pockets it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail. roclklin who has just about reached the cabin he looks back in dave's direction, and then looking toward the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.}
<B>__{the cabin door is partly open}
<A>__{and through it rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.}
<B>__{rocklin draws his gun and moves stealthily towards the cabin door}
