<A>__{the silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of light, refracted through water, which turns into... a moon seen in reflection on a sheet of ice the moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above begins to spider web and crack.}
<L>__{exterior frozen pond night}
<A>__{snow covered trees in every direction. the ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. a young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. this is jack frost thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but then...then i saw the moon. it was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. and when it did...i wasn't scared anymore.}

<D>__{why i was there, and what i was meant to do that i've never known. and a part of me wonders if i ever will.}
<A>__{jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. he looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. curious, he picks it up. almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. odd.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 2.}
<A>__{jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. jack is visibly confused. he touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks. then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond. another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air. jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees. jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.}

<A>__{townsfolk continue to pass through jack, unaware of his presence. shaken, jack turns and retreats into the forest.}

<A>__{as north crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear. the elves duck out of the way as north launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair close as his huge hand gropes furiously among his work tools, finally grabbing a miniature hammer. as north's humming along with his music, delicately chiseling into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word nice clearly visible his intense blue eye magnified in a jeweler's eyepiece a delicate sculpting tool cuts fine details into the ice his hands place the finished piece on a curving ice track: an ice locomotive. it belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed }

<A>__{he takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. he chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair then wings unfold jet engines sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track suddenly, the door is thrown open by one of north's concerned yetis, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces.}
