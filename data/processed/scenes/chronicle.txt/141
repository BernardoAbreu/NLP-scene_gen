<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{they're getting into downtown now. we can hear sirens. casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal, until there's a loud crash; then casey swishes the camera to reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.}
<C>__{casey }
<D>__{how how is that possible, that's not possible }
<A>__{there's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains down onto the car. matt slams on the brakes, looking up through the windshield, searching the sky.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{where are you, man?}
<A>__{there's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on the passenger's side, next to casey.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{listen, you can't be here, i need you to turn this car around right now and }
<A>__{the police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away. casey screams.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{what's...what is...what's...matt please, please }
<A>__{the car suddenly rockets into the air, straight up, flipping end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. casey's breathing is painfully short and sharp. matt stares out into the night sky. he flicks on the brights. there's andrew, in his hospital gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain. a news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a moment, andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight. his eyes flash to the car.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{what are you doing here!?}
<A>__{the windshield is torn out, and seconds later matt is ripped out of the car as though yanked by a giant hook, taking his seatbelt with him.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{no no no}
<A>__{the car goes into freefall, no longer important to andrew, plummeting down, down, down. casey's screams are barely audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to her death. and then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting, the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans... stillness. casey's camera is pointed down, showing her adidas...and matt's high tops.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{stay here, okay? you have to stay here.}
<C>__{casey }
<P>__{(barely coherent)}
<D>__{you can fly?}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{stay here. i have to talk to andrew.}
<C>__{casey }
<D>__{matt..what...}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{casey, i'm sorry, i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.}
<C>__{casey }
<D>__{matt wait! wait please! matt!}
<A>__{note: in the following sequence, everything is seen in glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing. much of what happens should be seen through implication, rather than direct effect. everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can fully keep track.}
<B>__{from several helicams.}
<A>__{the feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio, meaning no narration from the reporter. there are several chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and we intercut as necessary.}
