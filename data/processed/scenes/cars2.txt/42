<L>__{exterior sky day}
<A>__{siddeley breaks through some cloud cover, flies with purpose.}
<L>__{interior jet day}
<A>__{a well appointed spy jet. various computers line the walls.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{now that's how i like to start the day! you never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(scanning mater)}
<D>__{i hope that device didn't fall off.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{that's the closest i ever been to missing my flight! that was }
<A>__{with a robotic arm, holley grabs the the device that rod redline hid under mater. she yanks it out with a goose.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(jumps)}
<D>__{yow!}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{still in one piece, great.}
<A>__{holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. it starts "analyzing."}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i gotta go to a doctor. i keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{downloading the photo now.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, lemme introduce you two.}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{this here is finn mcsomething or other. he's a first class vip airport whatchamacallit. and finn, this here's my date.}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{i never did get your name.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{oh yes, sorry. it's shiftwell. holley shiftwell.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to finn)}
<D>__{it's shiftwell. holley }
<A>__{ding! the computer is done analyzing. the cabin lights dim.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{finally. time to see who's behind all this.}
<A>__{an image is blasted between the three of them. it's of a photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(to mater, expectantly)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. it's an old aluminum v8 with a lucas electrical system and whitworth bolts. shoot, them whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. them ain't metric, they ain't inches...}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{yes, ok, right. but who's engine is this, mater?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{but you're the one who took it.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{holley.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{oh, right. yes, of course. "a good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." sorry.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{agent? you mean like insurance agent, like,}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{`like a good neighbor, mater is there'? wait, you mean secret agents. you guys is spies!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?}
<A>__{holley has these stats in seconds. kid's play.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{it was standard in seven models over a 12 year period. at least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.}
<A>__{mater moves his seat forward, through one part of the hologram so he's face to face with holley.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you're pretty.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{yes, alright. thank you.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{and so nice.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{just pay attention.}
<A>__{she moves the engine photo so it's now blocking mater again.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{this seems like a dead end. if there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit i'd be a lot happier.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you might not be happy, but i bet this feller is. see how he's had most of his parts replaced? and see all them boxes over there? them's all original parts. they ain't easy to come by.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{rare parts.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{that's something we can track.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{exactly!}
<A>__{holley drops her screen down.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{well done, mater! i would never have seen that.}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{i know of a black market parts dealer in paris, a treacherous lowlife. but, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wait, what?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{you obviously have plenty of experience in the field.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well yeah i live right next to one.}
<P>__{(thinks about it)}
<D>__{i don't know, finn. i ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{you're helping me. please, mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, okay. but you know i'm just a tow truck, right?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{right. and i'm just in the import export business. siddeley?}
<C>__{siddeley}
<D>__{yes, finn?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{paris. tout de suite.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, two of them sweets for me too, sid!}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{you know, i always wanted to be a spy.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(smiling sweetly)}
<D>__{really? me too.}
<C>__{siddeley}
<D>__{afterburners, sir?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{is there any other way?}
