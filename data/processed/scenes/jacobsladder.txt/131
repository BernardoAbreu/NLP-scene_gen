<L>__{interior jacob's bedroom night}
<A>__{the bedroom is dark. jacob and jezzie are making love. a half smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. jezzie is poised on top of jacob and his eyes are focused on her face. a hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. its flickering light plays games with jacob's eyes and for a moment jezzie seems to disappear. jacob reaches out for her breasts and his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her. with sudden, hallucinogenic impact, jacob feels himself drawn into a starry universe opening from inside her. the camera plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. pulsations of its light whiten the screen. out of the whiteness appears a momentary flash of the celestial staircase, accompanied by sounds of sexual climax. the staircase sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. the sparkle becomes a glimmer in jezzie's eye as her face fills the screen. she looks especially lovely and radiant. her image moves with the lamplight. jacob's face is ecstatic. he can barely talk and simply basks in jezzie's glow. slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.}
