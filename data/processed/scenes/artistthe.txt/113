<L>__{exterior beggar street day}
<D>__{george is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged shoes. he is shirtless. with jack by his side, he walks along the sidewalk. there are a few other people walking along. about twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. he holds out his hand to passers by. george approaches and, when there are no other passers by between him and george, the beggar glances at him and lowers his hand. he doesn't raise it as george approaches. george stops in front of him and looks at him, but the beggar motions to him to scram. george continues on his way. for that moment at least, he has become one of them. he buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses himself in the crowd. some distance later, he stops to check his reflection in a shop window. the image he sees is that of a bum. it's even more striking because the in the window there is a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf. the image of the mannequin and that of george are superimposed. a cop comes up to george and begins talking to him in a friendly manner. he speaks but we don't know what about. there is not title card. george visibly has no idea what the cop is talking about. the cop seems to be talking about nothing important, just chatting... he talks and talks... george doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand why he's talking to him. he's lost. title card: what did you say? the cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. he thinks he's talking to a madman. he doesn't persist, merely sizes george up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop walks off. george, totally bewildered by the incident, seems to lose his grip on himself a little more.}
