<L>__{interior massey myerson conference room day}
<A>__{wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against the other. miles sits gazing sadly out the window. the room is empty. there is the whir of ventilation. the click of the door attracts both their attention and brings them to their feet. marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by ruth, who sits next to her, places her attache case on the table top, and snaps its clasps.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{alright.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{ruth.}
<A>__{miles and marylin are looking at each other. quietly:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hello marylin.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{hello miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{it's not something i wanted either.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{but then i guess something inside me died when i realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{yes. i know. it's exactly how i felt when i realized you'd hired the goon to kill...}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{now you both wait a minute. nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{hear, hear.}
<A>__{there is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. wrigley looks at miles.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{apparently, from what i can gather, a burglar broke into your house became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself.}
<A>__{miles is still looking at marylin.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{where does that leave us?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{we've outlined a settlement...}
<A>__{she pushes a piece of paper across the table.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{we think it's more than generous.}
<A>__{miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table. he looks at marylin.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{my client is prepared to consider a reconciliation.}
<A>__{marylin looks a miles.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{how could i trust you, after... after all of this.}
<A>__{miles, staring at marylin, cuts in:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you wounded me first, marylin.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{your forgetting rex rexroth?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're forgetting howard doyle?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{forgery? fraud?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{income tax evasion?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{murder?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{murder!}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i don't see how we can ever find our way back from...}
<A>__{miles, with his eyes still on marylin, reaches into his suit coat. he withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you know... there's nothing in the massey pre nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed.}
<A>__{he decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name. he pushes the paper across the table toward marylin. gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper. there is a long silence. we hear only the hum of ventilation, and wrigley's quiet snuffling. ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses over marylin's shoulder at the sheet of paper. marylin however, looks only at miles.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{it's the massey pre nup }
<A>__{marylin rips the paper in half.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{o kay. i'm going back to the office}
<A>__{wrigley sobs openly.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{come on wrigley, i will buy you a drink and an anti depressant.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{no one will ever love me that way.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{not if you're lucky. no.}
<A>__{miles rises slowly to his feet. he puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward. marylin rises slowly to her feet. she leans forward. they kiss.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{let's go home.}
