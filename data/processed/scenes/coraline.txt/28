<A>__{coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.}
<L>__{interior other study continuous}
<A>__{she sees the back of a man like her father, only with more hair. instead of tapping away at his computer, though, he's picking notes on a baby grand piano.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{he turns around. he, too, has shiny button eyes. he seems happier and a little more handsome than real dad, and wears an iridescent robe over polka dot pajamas, with orange monkey slippers on his feet. he smiles broadly.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{hello, coraline. want to hear my new song?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{my father can't play piano.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{no need to ... this piano plays me!}
<A>__{dr. seuss gloves connected with rods and pulleys pop out of the piano's front and onto his hands. his hands raise up then drop down to play pounding stride piano as other father sings out.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{making up a song about coraline. she's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. she's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on cor a line.}
<A>__{coraline is amazed as his hands fly.}
<C>__{other father }
<D>__{when she comes around exploring mom and i will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on coraline.}
<A>__{anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i, uh sorry but she said to tell you the food's ready.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{mmmmm! who's starving? raise your hand.}
<A>__{he sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other gloved hand slaps his face. she laughs, then covers her mouth.}
