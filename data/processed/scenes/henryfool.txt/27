<L>__{interior the grim house. upstairs day}
<A>__{same time. fay lies across her bed in her towel, holding a pose and glancing anxiously back at the door. finally, losing her patience, she gets up.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{she opens the door and looks out into the hall. he's not there. she steps out into the hall and listens.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{henry?}
<A>__{nothing. she comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint activity from down below. she proceeds downstairs. she sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living room and stops. she goes white, her mouth falling open in horror. henry and mary are screwing one another on the couch. sloppy, impassioned, brute sex.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{mommy!!!!!}
<A>__{they fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as henry falls over the coffee table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers. fay is crushed. she breaks out in tears and runs upstairs. henry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, uncertain and confused.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{get out!}
