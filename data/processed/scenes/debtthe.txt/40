<A>__{stephan is smoking. david sits at the table. he is using a file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of sprung steel. both men can hear the bath running in the bathroom, both very aware of this new female presence in the house they've been sharing together for the last month.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{what do you think of your new wife?}
<A>__{david frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{too young.}
<A>__{stephan watches him, amused.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{pretty.}
<A>__{david shrugs.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{you didn't notice.}
<A>__{he begins to sort his possessions out.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{you know what i've noticed? you don't notice women. i've noticed that. how long have i known you?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(examining the steel)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{two years. all the places we've been to. you don't look at women. before i get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me?}
<A>__{david sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for stephan to examine. we hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse of rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door heading for her room. the two men watch her pass. stephan turns and catches david's expression.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{well, well...i think he just noticed.}
