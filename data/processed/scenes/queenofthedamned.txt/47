<L>__{interior villa bedroom night}
<A>__{a great round room encircled with candles, their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside storm. a huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. his neck wears a swollen bite. another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. his hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees... an indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. an easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby louis iv chair. he makes for a door when... lestat suddenly stops. he looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. it's a portrait of himself in ancient roman garb, like the god mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly... the sleeping man leaps up, grabs lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the young man's neck. lestat fights as best he can but his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the floor. finally... the strange man lifts himself up from lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire marius, the mysterious figure. wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth }
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{lestat. welcome.}
<A>__{weakened and helpless, lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{who are you? do i know you?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i'm unknowable by nature.}
<A>__{marius advances again on the young man...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{but you may call me marius.}
<A>__{as lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i'm the lord of a great manor. they'll send an army of men to look for me.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i doubt they'll find you, lord de lioncourt. you're a long way from home...}
<A>__{his strength leaving him, lestat slumps flat on the floor.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you're weak... near passing. i can barely hear your heartbeat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i will kill you!}
<A>__{marius smiles, impressed.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you really do fear nothing. it is why i chose you. because you think things are possible which aren't possible...}
<A>__{lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{chose me? for what?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{my companion. someone to share my burden.}
<A>__{bending down, he gazes at lestat.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you've lost a great deal of blood.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(near tears)}
<D>__{i'm dying.}
<A>__{suddenly marius draws a knife from a roman sheath on his belt. with the last of his strength, lestat grabs his attacker's wrist.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{then drink.}
<A>__{guiding lestat's hand with the knife, marius smiles and cuts his own arm, opening his veins. lestat stares in true terror as marius lets his blood drip onto lestat's lip. lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his mouth...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{good, is it not?}
<A>__{and indeed... it does taste good. that's the new terror that's gripping him. he crosses himself and stares up into marius's gentle eyes. marius bends down, cups lestat's chin.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{drink and live. you've been brave enough for one night, my son.}
<A>__{marius brings his open vein to lestat's lips. lestat hesitates, but then suddenly... feeds hungrily as marius's face fills with the bond. he slowly sinks down to his knees as lestat feeds and feeds. as lestat drinks, a barrage of images flood into him...}
<B>__{images}
<A>__{of marius's life through the ages... impressionistic, subliminal burst of images, color... the glory days of the roman empire to this very moment flash by...}
<B>__{back to lestat}
<A>__{he keeps drinking from the vampire marius who gasps with the creation of his child.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{drink... drink and learn.}
<A>__{lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he draws the "life" into him with full force, as... marius begins to weaken, himself.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{there... there... that will do.}
<A>__{but lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{no... no more. lestat, no more!}
<A>__{with one great move, marius pulls lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. marius reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the rush. slowly, lestat starts to feel something. pain begins travelling through his body, consuming him until he screams. marius crosses to lestat convulsing on the floor. he kneels and gently wipes his brow. lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies...}
<A>__{wiping his brow as he dies... then, lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins to laugh almost drunkenly. raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{more!}
<A>__{lestat smiles with red glistening lips. a beat on marius as he slowly smiles, too.}
