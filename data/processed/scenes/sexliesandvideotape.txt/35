<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes. i just got busy.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{that's interesting, because i didn't leave a message.}
<A>__{john is waking up a little.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{then maybe i saw an old message. there are a lot of them on my desk, you know.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{who'd you have lunch with?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i ate by myself.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{are you having an affair?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus christ, where'd that come from? i have a late lunch by myself and now i'm fucking somebody?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, are you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, i'm not. frankly, i'm offended at the accusation.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{if i'm right, i want to know. i don't want you to lie. i'd be very upset, but not as upset as if i'd found out you'd been lying.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there's nothing to know, ann.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i can't tell you how upset i would be if you were lying.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ann, you are completely paranoid. not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like i'm dipped in shit. you know, i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{my sister, for one. is that who it is?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{for god's sake, ann, i am not fucking your sister. i don't find her that attractive, for one.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{is that supposed to comfort me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was just saying, you know? i didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. i could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{but i'm not.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm not either!!}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why don't i believe you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{always the lawyer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{goddam right. i mean, can you imagine: "your honor, i'm positive this man is guilty. i can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but i have this really strong feeling."}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you've made your pointerior}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just...i'm under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and i work all day, i come home, i look forward to seeing you, and...it hurts that you accuse me like that.}
<A>__{a pause. ann exhales.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i'm sorry, too. i...i get these ideas in my head, you know, and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. and then i want to believe it so i don't think i've wasted the whole day. last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia, i don't know why.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't, either. i mean, cynthia, of all people. she's so...}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{loud.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. jeez, give me some credit.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i didn't say it was rational, i just said i was convinced.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{isn't therapy helping at all?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i don't know. sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{quitting your therapy won't feed the children of ethiopia.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you never used to say "fucking".}
