<A>__{to inside of private office which has another door leading to a hallway, and among other articles of furniture, there is an impressive looking desk on which is a telephone. just as groucho comes through the door into his office, chico enters through the other door. he is wearing gauntlets, reaching half way up his arms. as they walk toward each other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad dash for the telephone on the desk. chico beats groucho to the phone, picks up the receiver.}

<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{then you don't wanna work hard?}
<C>__{chico}

<D>__{'at's a fine.}
<A>__{telephone bell rings. they both make a dash for the telephone, but harpo rushes in through hallway door and reaches the phone first. harpo picks up through telephone receiver, listens to conversation on the other end with an occasional nod and shake of the head. as he listens, he scribbles message on a piece of paper. he holds the written message up to the telephone receiver for a moment, then writes a few more words on the paper. during this, chico and groucho stand by, terribly worried. finally harpo hangs up the receiver and exits, tearing up the paper}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(after a moment's glance at harpo)}
<D>__{you know, i'd be lost without a telephone. now where were we? oh, yes i just made you secretary of war. the first thing you do is buy ammunition you buy it from me and i get 10% commission.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{what do i get?}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{you get half mine and i get half yours.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{i don't want to buy ammunition we no gotta war.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{then we've gotta start one. do you know how to start a war?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{sure, that's easy. you gotta insult somebody.}
<A>__{groucho suddenly slaps chico across the face with his gloves, then as quickly brings to light a card which he presents to chico in the professional manner of an experienced duelist}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{my card.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's a no good. you gotta insult somebody from another country. look }

<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{why wasn't i insulted?}

<D>__{that's a no good. if i apologize we no got a war. look i send you a scrap of paper. you send me a scrap of paper and we have a scrap.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{you've got a brain after all and how you get along without it is amazing to me now, who can i insult?... who do we owe money to?...}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{ambassador trentino! how about him?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{he's a very easy to insult i say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.}
<C>__{groucho}

<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{you're lucky i don't slap your face you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. where did you hear that story?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{you told it to me.}
