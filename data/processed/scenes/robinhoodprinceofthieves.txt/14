<L>__{exterior interior peasant's cottage day}
<A>__{crash! an armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. children scream and run. a soldier clubs at them, laughing. outside. more soldiers. some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. pillaging. vandalizing. searching. guy gisborne: an impressive figure on horseback. strikingly handsome except that one of his ears is missing. we recognize his face from the druid ceremony. he coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, fanny.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you owe the sheriff three bushels of flax.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{you starve us. first the drought, now you take what food we have left.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{for starving people, you look fat enough.}
<C>__{soldier}
<P>__{(emerging from the hut)}
<D>__{he's not here, sir. none but the woman and children.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<P>__{(to fanny)}
<D>__{where is your mate? the man they call little.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{he died last winter.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{is that so? we hear he is very much alive. hiding out in the forest. he probably ran away to escape your scolding tongue.}
<A>__{the soldiers join in his laughter. incensed, fanny pounds her fist on his legs. gisborne kicks her down.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{norman swine!}
<A>__{a boy of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at gisborne's throat.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{no, wulf! don't! 'twill only make it worse.}
<A>__{wulf backs off. nostrils flaring with repressed hate.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{seize him!}
<A>__{while two soldiers grab the boy, others examine his hiding place. a secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. gisborne dismounts.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{this is lord nottingham's deer. is this how you repay the sheriff for his protection?}
<C>__{wulf }
<D>__{like a wolf protects sheep.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{i killed it. we needed the meat.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{poachers hang. either he dies or you die.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{my mother lies to protect me.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{no, wulf!}
<A>__{gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you have deprived us of a hunt, boy.}
<A>__{he cups his hand in the deer's blood. smears it on wulf's face.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{the hounds know the scent well.}
<A>__{he tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. they tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{run, boy. like a deer. give us some pleasure before you die.}
<A>__{to the accompaniment of the hounds' savage howls and the horrified screams of his family, wulf runs.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{unleash them!}
