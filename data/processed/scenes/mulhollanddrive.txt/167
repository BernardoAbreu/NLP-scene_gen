<L>__{interior executive building second floor day}
<A>__{betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the receptionist. she hands over her pass. the receptionist looks at it, hands it back to betty and points down the hall to her left.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{number 43, on the left.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. the door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one side.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{my name is betty elms. i'm here to audition for... mr. brown}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{good. perfect timing. have a seat and i will get mr. brown.}
<A>__{the receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then enters. she closes the door behind her and betty is alone in the sitting room. she sits on a couch and looks at the old movie posters covering all four walls. in a moment the same door opens again and an elderly, distinguished looking gentleman wally brown comes out smiling. betty stands up immediately.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{betty elms?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i'm wally brown. your aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{very pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{come in. i'd like you to meet everyone.}
<A>__{as they walk into wally's office...}
<C>__{wally }
<D>__{i took the liberty of inviting an extra person to see your audition. she saw your resume picture and was very interested in meeting you.}
<A>__{inside wally's office several people rise out of chairs when wally enters with betty.}
<C>__{wally }
<D>__{betty elms this is jack taft, my assistant, jimmy katz who we've already cast for the part of "chuck". he'll be doing the scene with you. this is julie chadwick and bob brooker, the director, and our surprise guest is sarah james. we couldn't afford her to cast our picture, but as casting agents go she's the best.}
<C>__{sarah james}
<D>__{why thank you, wally. hello betty.}
<A>__{she and betty shake hands.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{sarah james}
<D>__{this is nicki, my assistant.}
<A>__{nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat eyed glasses nods coolly to betty.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{and this is martha, martha johnson, who you met out front.}
<A>__{betty nervously smiles to the room.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well. shall we get to it? would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?}
<A>__{betty's hands are beginning to sweat.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, no, i'm fine.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well then, take a seat everyone. betty why don't you join jimmy and we'll play the scene. is there anything you'd like to say bob... something to betty before they begin?}
<A>__{betty stops on her way across to jimmy and looks to bob the director.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no ... it's not a contest, see, the two of them with themselves, so don't play it for real until it gets real.}
<A>__{betty doesn't know what to say. she catches sarah's assistant, nicki, rolling her eyes.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{betty continues walking toward jimmy who opens his arms to her as she approaches. he's old enough to be her father.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{just tell me where it hurts, baby.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i want to play this one close, bob. like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. that felt good. whaddya think?}
<A>__{betty looks from jimmy to bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that'd be good, jimmy. just don't rush that line again. i told you... the line where you say, "before what?"}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i was playin' off 'em. they say, "they'll arrest you"... and stuff like that.. "put you in jail"... they say it like that. they all say it the same way, so i react like that.}
<A>__{jimmy turns to betty.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{look ... what's your name?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{betty.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah ... betty. you don't rush it. i don't rush it. we play it close, just like in the movies.}
<A>__{jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around betty and brings her in against his pot belly.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{dad's best friend goes to work.}
<A>__{jimmy smiles as he brings betty a little closer. she is trying to concentrate through the nervousness and jimmy's breath. there is a silence as jimmy looks her in the eyes. everyone in the room is looking betty in the eyes.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{bob?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{and ... action!}
<A>__{betty and jimmy start the scene. it is very difficult for betty as jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're still here?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i came back. i thought that's what you wanted.}
<A>__{jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. he gives the last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{nobody wants you here.}
<A>__{betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from jimmy. jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{my parents are right upstairs! they think you've left.}
<A>__{jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward betty.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{so ... surprise!}
<A>__{betty pushes him back.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i can call them... i can call my dad.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{but you won't.}
<A>__{he grabs betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him. he puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and keeps going down her hips. he jerks his hand back. betty looks down and sees jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh. betty takes her hand and gently presses down on jimmy's hand. she slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. jimmy lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her thigh as he sees her smile. with his other hand jimmy gently pulls her closer. something has started coming over betty and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way. she's surprising herself.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(almost a hot whisper)}
<D>__{you're playing a dangerous game here. if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.}
<A>__{jimmy now surprises himself. he becomes almost tender and genuinely worked up from the heat coming off betty.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you know what i want...it's not that difficult.}
<A>__{where the scene should turn to anger from betty it can't now and betty plays it as she feels it. she stays in very close to jimmy looking him right in the eyes.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(whispering desperately slowly)}
<D>__{get out... get out before i call my dad. he trusts you... you're his best friend.}
<P>__{(her arms go around him)}
<D>__{this will be the end of everything.}
<A>__{jimmy gets lost. he doesn't know where he is anymore. he can only see betty's eyes.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what about you? what will your dad think about you?}
<A>__{betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{stop... just stop! that's what you said from the beginning. if i tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(caught by her transfixing,}
<D>__{sultry eyes, and almost breathless ... he finds himself}
<P>__{taking an extra long pause)}
<D>__{before what?}
<A>__{as scripted betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her back, but wraps the knife around behind jimmy and pulls him into a kiss.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(as she kisses him whispers)}
<D>__{before i kill you.}
<A>__{jimmy panics and pushes betty away with his hands on her shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. he finally is able to say his line.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{then they'd put you in jail.}
<A>__{as scripted betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of the scene took her over. tears begin running down her cheeks. she backs away.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i hate you... i hate us both!}
<A>__{she pretends to drop the knife. the scene ends. everyone in the room has become mesmerized by betty, but they soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the performance. sarah turns to nicki.}
<C>__{sarah james}
<D>__{i'm going to take her over there.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{big time!}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling still shocked at herself.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well, there it was.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{there it was it was! baby, you got a way!}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{bob?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{very good. really. i mean it was forced maybe but still humanistic. yeah, very good, really.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well, thank you betty, and i mean that. that was very impressive. you've done your aunt proud and i'm going to tell her the first chance i get. we'll speak again soon i'm sure, and thank you so much for coming in.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well, thank you.}
<A>__{betty doesn't quite know what to do. she moves to the center of the room and just stands. remnants of the scene still staying with her. sarah stands and nicki stands just after.}
<C>__{sarah james}
<D>__{thank you, wally. i'm sure you all have a lot to talk about. we'll walk betty out.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well, yes indeed. our pleasure, sarah, and don't you be a stranger. we'd love to see you around here again real soon.}
<C>__{sarah james}
<D>__{well come along, betty.}
<A>__{sarah takes betty's hand and they go to the door. betty turns back once more and smiles.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{thank you again, mr. brown. it was nice meeting all of you.}
<A>__{everyone nods and waves and betty is taken out by sarah and nicki.}
