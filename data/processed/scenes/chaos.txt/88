<L>__{exterior bernie callo's home day}
<A>__{dekker leans back against the car, conners approaches...}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{what they told callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. clearly this wasn't part of a plan callo would've agreed with.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{you'd think a cop would be smarter.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{as cops we come across every temptation in the book. money, drugs, power. we'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... we're not saints.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{so, callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. why?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{man said he wanted vengeance.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{piss anyone off lately?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{both can't help but smile. jenkins walks up.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{i just got off the phone with agent doyle. after the charlotte break in, the prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. so, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing?}
<P>__{(to conners)}
<D>__{still make sense to you?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{nothing about today makes sense.}
<A>__{dekker watches as bernie callo's body is loaded into the coroner's vehicle. teddy assists mrs. callo into a police car. vincent carries the box of evidence from the home. dekker's mind works overtime, then...}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{"return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain. for it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path."}
<A>__{conners and jenkins share a confused look.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(to jenkins)}
<D>__{don't look at me, he's your find.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{say that again, detective?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{we go back to where this all started. we go to the bank.}
