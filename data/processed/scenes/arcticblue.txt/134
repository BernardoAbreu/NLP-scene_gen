<A>__{wearing one of eric's coats, anne marie stands in the center of three similarly sized trees. a flare supplies the light. the big remington rifle leans against the tree closest to her. she tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a sturdy tree branch twenty five feet from the ground. then she throws the other end over an opposing branch and stretches the rope like a clothesline. she attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between the other two. she kneels and ties something below frame to the cross length rope. pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists something heavy to the level of the branches. the flare burns out, plunging the area into darkness. anne marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and nervously tries to light another flare. as she does, the forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres. seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and runs back to the turtle.}
