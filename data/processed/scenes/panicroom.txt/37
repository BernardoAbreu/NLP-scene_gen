<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{meg sits up in bed. she's bleary, her head feels like someone rested a manhole cover on it. she gets up, in the dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark. she steps through the door.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{she walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light switch, but can't find it. she blinks, squints, tries to get her bearings. the only light is a harsh white glow that comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video monitors. she finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds her. she's not in the bathroom. she's wandered into the panic room by mistake. she turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind her. we linger for a look at the video screens. if only she'd done the same, she'd see what we see. on the monitors, we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a group, silently debating what to do.}
