<A>__{carl rounds the corner to see... ellie, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty. the old house has been transformed into a make believe dirigible cockpit. ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle.}

<A>__{carl is distracted by the muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall.}

<A>__{carl smiles.}
<C>__{young ellie}
