<L>__{interior barn day continuous}
<A>__{picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn. straw on the floor... farm implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in through the slats. there are stalls in the barn with a few horses visible. kirk is standing a short distance away he looks surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the tray of food.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(re: barn)}
<D>__{this doesn't look like your bedroom.}
<A>__{kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to fall into place. he smiles with a growing realization...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no... no, it's not. it's better.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{better?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{this is my uncle's barn in iowa...}
<A>__{he points to a horse with a saddle on it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(re: horse)}
<D>__{i took that horse out for a ride seven years ago... on a spring day.}
<A>__{kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring day.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{just like this. if i'm right, this is the day i met antonia.}
<A>__{he turns to picard.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{this nexus of yours is very clever. i can start all over again do things right from day one.}
<A>__{kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. picard watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...}
