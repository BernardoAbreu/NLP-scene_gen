<L>__{interior green room (night) medium shot}
<A>__{ben is talking. buchanan is listening carefully.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{...recognized him, and he recognized me. so he jumped for it. and that is all.}
<C>__{buchanan}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{trying to liquidate one of their own big shots. i wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country...}
<A>__{at this moment the phone rings. woburn, who is now re placing the two special branch men in the room, picks up the telephone.}
<C>__{woburn}
<D>__{hello.}
<P>__{(he listens for a moment)}

<C>__{buchanan}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{buchanan speaking.}
<A>__{buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he listens with increased interest.}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{right. bye.}
<A>__{buchanan hangs up, turns to woburn, but half speaks in the direction of the mckenna's.}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{the draytons are at the embassy.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{we have ways of finding out from the inside.}
<A>__{ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if the draytons are at the embassy, hank has to be there too!}
<A>__{buchanan turns his attention back to ben.}
<C>__{buchanan}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{you're probably right. but we can do nothing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why can't you?}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{every embassy in a foreign country has extra territorial rights.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what does that mean in common language?}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{as far as we're concerned, this embassy stands on foreign soil.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{we could have the foreign office serve a writ on the ambassador.}
<A>__{he breaks off and speaks apologetically as if it were i parenthesis.}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{...you know, i'm not responsible for the complications of international law...}
<A>__{he resumes:}
<C>__{buchanan}
<D>__{...if only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.}
<A>__{as they are talking ben is thinking hard, obviously hatching some scheme in his mind.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what's the telephone number of this embassy.}
<A>__{both of the men looking at ben a moment without answering and then woburn speaks first.}
<C>__{wonburn}
<D>__{grosvenor 0144.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what are you thinking about, ben?}
<A>__{without answering jo, ben picks up the 'phone.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{grosvenor 0144.}
<A>__{ben looks at the group briefly. buchanan looks at ben with keen curiosity.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm going to speak to the minister himself.}
<A>__{buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. we hear the answering click on the other end of the phone.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{may i speak to the prime minister, please?}
<A>__{there is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice mumbling on the other end of the phone. ben interrupts the question.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. its important.}
<A>__{the voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly, and there is silent. ben has a satisfied look on his face, as he hands the receiver to jo. she seems frightened.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what am i supposed to say, ben? i don't know }
<P>__{(she trails off)}
<D>__{ben, half looking at woburn and buchanan, gives her instructions.}
