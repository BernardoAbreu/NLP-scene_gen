<A>__{seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. sam pickles, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did ya see 'bonanza' last night? can you tell me why ben cartwright had a colored guy stay over?}
<A>__{gil, who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{ben cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the ponderosa?}
<A>__{mouse, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at sam with an investigative look.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{did he know this guy personally?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and ben cartwright said 'sure thing.' it doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. is that crazy or what? if a colored guy came to my door and said 'can i stay the night,' i'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! it's nothing personal, mind you.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{you're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{me? no, i'm not a bigot.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{if you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's the fact the ben cartwright's on the ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. it's not like he's living on reisterstown road with houses all around... we're talking about the west here. it's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the west. it doesn't make sense, that's all i'm saying.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{come on... you're a bigot, that's what you are.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{listen, i will sell tin to anybody ... i don't care who he is. a mark's a mark, whether he's chinese, indian or from mars... i'm thoroughly integrated. makes no difference to me... i just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house.}
