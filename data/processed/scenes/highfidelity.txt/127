<L>__{interior exterior record store day}
<A>__{rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where dick and barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical minor threat meets brian eno, if that's possible. rob joins them in contemplation.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what is this.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's vince and justin.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{the little skate fuckers.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{yes way. it's really...}
<A>__{rob and dick look at him, ready to pounce }
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(pained to say it)}
<D>__{it's really fucking good.}
<A>__{dick and barry look to rob, who continues to just listen... he takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, seemingly with a mission. vince and justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street. when they see rob they stop, get ready to flee. he walks across to them. dick comes out and hovers in the background.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{your tape. it's good.}
<A>__{they mumble thanks.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's rough. but it shows promise. we record a couple of songs right, in a studio. i will take care of the rest. i will put out your record. any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{wait a minute. island records charged u2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{we're not there yet, justin.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i'm vince.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{he begins to move toward the store. vince and justin look at each other. rob gets to the door but stops and turns.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey. what's the name of your band?}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{the kinky wizards.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{we saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a renaissance fair.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{nice.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what's the name of your label?}
<A>__{rob looks at them. then at dick. then through the window at barry, inside looking out. then at his own reflection in the window. then back at them.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{broken records. welcome aboard.}
<A>__{rob walks back inside. he seems to be shaking a little.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i heard you, man. don't give me that "what" shit. you just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so? you even said they're good.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{hello. do you see anyone else around here with a band, mr. branson? mr. phil spector?}
<A>__{rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room. laura enters.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hey, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh, hi.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{where's rob?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite. do you have an appointment?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. that's all.}
<A>__{laura puts it together, and smiles. she goes to the back and crack the door, finding rob sitting on a box, thinking.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hi. what are you doing?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{wanna go to dinner?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{at paul and miranda's. paul from work.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh. well. we don't really get along. paul and i.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i know. but you've never met. it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ha.}
