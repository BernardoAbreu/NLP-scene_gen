<L>__{13x. seven or eight reporters, black and white, and still}
<A>__{photographers and bingham, half with cassius, half photographer in privileged position.}
<C>__{a reporter}
<D>__{the people look to you. do you plan on being a people's champ, like joe louis?}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(tentative)}
<D>__{yeah. i going to be a people's champ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but not like joe louis, exactly...}
<C>__{a reporter}
<P>__{(starts)}
<D>__{mr. clay...?}
<A>__{and cassius drops it on them...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{and i'm not clay. clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. i don't want to be called after that slave name no more. so i'm "x." cassius x. and i'm a member of the nation of islam. the honorable elijah muhammad is my spiritual guide. malcolm x is my mentor.}
<A>__{this is hard news!}
<C>__{reporters}
<P>__{(all at once)}
<D>__{you a card carrying member? aren't black muslims a hate group?}

<P>__{(droll)}
<D>__{"card carrying"...? don't need no "card." you got a christian card? 750 million people believe in islam. i'm one of them.}
<C>__{another reporter }
<D>__{minister malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and elijah muhammad?}
<A>__{joseph 13x: we read his face listening to malcolm.}
<C>__{malcolm x}
<D>__{this is the champ's time. and i'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. so i got nothing you want...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i'm going to be a people's champion. but i don't have to be the way you want me to be. i'm gonna be what i want. and i'm free to think any way i want...}
<A>__{and, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither cassius nor malcolm will ever turn their backs on them.}
