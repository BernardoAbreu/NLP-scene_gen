<L>__{exterior park. day}
<A>__{renton and sick boy are seated in their firing patch, sitting on plastic bags with beer, vodka, hash and the cassette player. the airgun is present as before, but they are not making any use of it.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{eughh. sounds horrible.}
<C>__{renton}
<A>__{it wasn't that bad.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{did he you know?}
<C>__{renton}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{you know.}
<C>__{renton}
<A>__{no, he didn't make me touch it.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{oh no, don't even mention it.}
<C>__{renton}
<A>__{he made me lick it.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{god, you're sick.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{cut it out.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{when are you going to visit him?}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{don't know. maybe thursday.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{you're a real mate. and what about tommy? have you been to see him yet?}
<A>__{sick boy is silent. he stiffens as he avoids renton's gaze. they shift fractionally apart. renton tuts.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{fuck you. ok, so tommy's got the virus. bad news, big deal. the gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? swanney fucks his leg up. well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{you're all hear.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{i know a couple of addicts. stupid wee lassies. i feed them what they need. a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. it's easy money for me. not exactly a fortune, but i'm thinking, 'i should be coining it here.' less whores, more skag. swanney's right. get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. what do you think?}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{and i will tell you why. because i'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. i'm getting on with life. what are you doing?}
