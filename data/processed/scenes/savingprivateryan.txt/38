<A>__{farther along. the men are tired but alert. jackson is at pointerior miller behind him. the others at intervals. sarge brings up the rear. a sound. jackson stops. no one speaks, they communicate only with hand signals. jackson signals to miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming. miller signals for the men to get off the path. they ease into the brush. an instant later, a pair wary german infantry men appear. reiben grips his b.a.r. and looks to miller for permission to open up. miller shakes his head and signals, "let them go." a moment later an entire platoon of germans rounds the bend. fifty men. heavily armed. reiben breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi b.a.r. the german platoon passes, their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden americans. upham is wide eyed with fear. the others are stone faced.}
<B>__{the germans pass.}
<A>__{miller motions for his men to hold their positions. upham doesn't see the signal. he stands, breathing a sigh of relief, just as a german whip tail squad appears, trailing the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear. upham freezes. he's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly exposed. shitting bricks. pissed, miller prepares to fire. the whip tail squad approaches. then, the germans pass, miraculously, not seeing upham in the shadows. they walk on and disappear. upham is weak kneed, amazed that he's still alive. miller shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods. upham scurries after miller, staying close on his heels.}
