<L>__{interior charles' kitchen day}
<A>__{joe makes her up a not half bad, simple zombie make up. pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. in the background, the other kids prepare to film. he hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{where'd you learn how to do this?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{mostly the dick smith monster make up handbook.}
<A>__{she nods. whatever. charles is suddenly there, with cary:}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{hey! so i'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously you know that train model you made? can we blow it up and film it?}
<A>__{joe doesn't want to do this at all. at all. but...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{... sure.}
<C>__{charles cary}
<A>__{minterior gnarly! charles and cary head off, planning the explosions. alice looks at him knowingly.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i don't care, they can blow it up. i can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{you wanna see it? later? the... train? my train model? the train i made?}
<A>__{the lights in the house dim brown out then back on.}
<C>__{charles martin}
<A>__{that's like the third time dude. bitchen. that's happened.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{so how am i supposed to be a zombie?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh. just be a lifeless ghoul. someone with no soul, dead eyes. scary. d'you ever have mrs. mullin?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{for english? yeah }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ like her. but hungry, like hungry for human flesh. to make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do.}
<A>__{alice considers this then, after a beat, starts doing her best zombie. joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{oh my god. that's really good...}
<A>__{and alice slowly leans in toward him is this performance? or is this something else ? and she puts her mouth on his neck in a fake bite, which makes joe go still a shiver down his spine he's never felt anything like this in his life. and when she pulls back, her performance over, she's smiling. he doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{... not bad.}
