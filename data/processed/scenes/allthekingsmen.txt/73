<D>__{shut up yourself!}
<P>__{(goes to bed, shakes willie)}
<D>__{listen, willie, try it on your feet this time.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, no. wait a minute. my feet are killing me. let me stay here, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all right... look, willie, you tell 'em too much. just tell 'em you're going to soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(pathetically)}
<D>__{that's what i say.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but it's the way you say it. willie, make 'em cry. make 'em laugh, make 'em mad, even mad at you. stir 'em up and they'll love it and come back for more. but for heaven's sake don't try and improve their minds.}

<A>__{there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come in.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{a great governor.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nothing... except willie here has been saying as how he's not going to be governor.}
<C>__{sadie}
<P>__{(directly, to jack)}
<D>__{so you told him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't tell anyone anything... i just listen.}

<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{willie}

<D>__{that you're not going to be governor.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{jack! told me what?... told me what?}

<P>__{(loudly)}

<A>__{willie looks at her steadily for a moment.}

<D>__{well, you're the goat! you are the sacrificial goat! you are a sap... because you let 'em.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sadie! that's enough.}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{enough? he didn't even get anything out of it. oh, they'd have paid you to take a rap like that, but they didn't have to pay a sap like you. oh, no, you were so full of yourself and hot air, all you wanted was a chance to stand up on your hind legs and make a speech: my friends, what this state needs is a good five cent cigar. what this state needs is a }

<D>__{is it true?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's what they tell me.}

<P>__{(handing it to him)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{willie drinks it all.}
<C>__{jack}
