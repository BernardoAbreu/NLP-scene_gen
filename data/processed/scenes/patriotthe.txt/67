<A>__{british officers, clerks and aides work. they're in good spirits. lord cornwallis, a proud man, comfortable with command, coldly notes one of his officers slapping another on the back. major huntington rolls out a map for cornwallis.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{gentlemen.}
<A>__{the officers gather around the map.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{major, this is not an adequate map.}
<C>__{major huntington}
<D>__{we have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from charleston.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{a useful place for our maps.}
<C>__{major huntington}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, it won't happen again.}
<A>__{tarleton enters, followed by wilkins.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{my harrier. join us, colonel.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{sir.}
<A>__{tarleton and wilkins join them around the map.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{gentlemen, celebration is premature. we have a difficult campaign ahead of us. we are in predominately hostile country and we cannot rely on forage. as we move north, the bulk of our supplies will reach us by sea, through charleston, which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line, one that can only be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown.}
<C>__{cornwallis' officers}
<P>__{(multiple)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particular attention to tarleton.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{nonetheless, we must remember that this is a civil war...}
<A>__{tarleton proudly holds cornwallis' look.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{these colonials are our brethren and when this conflict is over, we will be reestablishing commerce with them. surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults on civilians will cease.}
<A>__{wilkins shifts uneasily. tarleton isn't cowed.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{i expect this war to be fought in a vigorous but civilized manner.}
<A>__{cornwallis looks at his other officers.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{have i made myself clear, gentlemen?}
<C>__{officers}
<P>__{(multiple)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{cornwallis shifts his eyes back to tarleton who was not among those who spoke. tarleton pointedly pauses a moment, then says:}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{cornwallis turns his attention back to the map. his men gather around.}
