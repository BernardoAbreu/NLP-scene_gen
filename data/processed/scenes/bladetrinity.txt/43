<L>__{exterior elevated rail station various night}
<A>__{a series of shots as abigail makes her way into the station, passing a few other people here and there.}
<L>__{interior elevated rail platform night}
<A>__{a depressing, dimly lit, partially open air station. abigail moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted. she glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench. beat. just the wind moaning in the tunnels, across the platform. then we hear a rustling sound abigail looks right, sees nothing. we hear another sound, this time from the left abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a figure ducking behind a concrete pillar. unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby. she backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar but no one is there. then a shadow moves behind her. she senses it, spinning but again, she seems to be alone. thoroughly frightened now, abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and slams right into dingo and proof! she gasps.}
<C>__{dingo}
<D>__{hey, pretty lady.}
<C>__{proof}
<D>__{sophisticated mama.}
<A>__{dingo and proof reveal their fangs. abigail screams, runs right into the arms of flick and squid! they grab her, ripping the babybjorn carrier from her chest, shoving her back at dingo and proof. in seconds, dingo and proof have abigail on the floor. they're tearing away at her clothing, laughing.}
<C>__{dingo}
<D>__{scream if this hurts, chica!}
<A>__{on flick, removing the baby from its carrier. he holds the baby up only it's not a baby. it's a doll with the words "fuck you!" written on its chest. flick is briefly confused and then the baby doll explodes, covering flick's face with a cloud of garlic gas! flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face }
<C>__{flick}
<D>__{ aghhk it's fucking garlic!}
<A>__{on dingo and proof, looking back, alarmed. then abigail pulls her knee to her chest. a silver spike springs out from the toe of her boot. she kicks up, imbedding the spike up through the underside of proof's chin. proof ashes. before dingo has a chance to act, abigail gets him in a leglock, flipping him back onto his ass.}
<B>__{abigail}
<A>__{jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat. long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders. she's not mousy at all. in fact, she's beautiful. and cut like an olympic athlete. and equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons. dingo snarls crunch! abigail plants her heel in his face, smashing in his nose. she does a cartwheel, kicks him again. follows that with flurry of punches. he goes down as flick and squid come charging! squid gets her in a choke hold. she flips him over her shoulder, kicking him in the nuts as he lands. he curls up, groaning abigail turns back to flick, elbowing him in the throat then returns to squid, ejecting a silver throwing knife from a spring loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist. she pops the knife through squid's chest. he ashes }
<B>__{following abigail}
<A>__{as she reaches behind her, removing a crescent shaped device secured to her back. she holds the crescent in the center, the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and chinkt! the device extends from either end, telescoping outward into a three foot long metal arc. connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful, buzzing uv laser. abigail lashes out, lopping off flick's arm. his arm falls, ashing. abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward through flick's mid section like a cheese cutter flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his trunk, ashing in the foreground, his burning particles falling away to reveal abigail in the background dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life. abigail gives her uv arc a twist. it retracts. she secures it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange looking "bloop" gun with a large barrel. she fires a rapidly expanding spherule of anti personnel foam splatters against dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up dingo goes down again. he panics, trying to scrape the gunk off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process like a mouse in a glue trap. abigail calmly approaches. she stands over dingo, staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference. she holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another silver stake }
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{scream if this hurts, chica.}
<A>__{ and slams the stake into his chest.}
<B>__{widen out}
<A>__{abigail turns, surveying her work. the ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers. in thirty seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all. a train approaches, pulls into the station. passengers disembark, flood the platform. they tramp all over the ashes of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter. abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. she is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.}
