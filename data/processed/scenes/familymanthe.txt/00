<L>__{interior kennedy airport, pan am terminal night}
<A>__{super: autumn, 1987 a line of passengers about to board a pan am flight to london. jack campbell, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, tom selleck mustache, the hopeful look of youth in his eyes... sitting next to... kate reynolds, 21, pretty, dorothy hamill haircut... rubbing the tears from her swollen red eyes...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i got you a few necessities...}
<A>__{kate hands jack a new copy of vonneguts cats cradle.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{your copy was a mess...}
<A>__{jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes off kate. she hands him a cassette.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all in one tape?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i also put side two of london calling on there...}
<A>__{kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the lips.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{that was not officially the goodbye kiss. it was just an interim kiss...}
<A>__{he looks at her, his eyes welling up. he pulls her close, kissing her deeply. then...}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{this will be the final boarding call for pan am flight 4 to london, heathrow.}
<A>__{jack takes kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to the gate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you have your ticket?}
<A>__{jack pulls out a blue pan am ticket envelope. kate nods. they embrace and kiss again. as they separate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{im not even gonna say it, kate. maybe itll be like i never left...}
<A>__{jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the gate. kate stands there, watching him go. then... ...a moment of intuition. something isnt right. she looks at jack, about to disappear into the jetway, trying to decide...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{jack turns. kate approaches him.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i have a bad feeling about this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{about the plane? what do you think its gonna crash? dont say that...}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do. but in my heart... this feels wrong.}
<A>__{she looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, then back into jacks eyes.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{dont go, jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you mean dont go at all? what about my internship?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for us, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{right, for us. but...im afraid that if you get on that plane...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant say...}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(torn)}
<D>__{go. im sorry, you should just go...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(thinking, then...)}
<D>__{no, youre right. what are we doing?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we're being responsible. go. get on the plane.}
<A>__{his eyes narrow as he measures her determination...}
<C>__{kate }
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{get the hell outta my sight. you bother me.}
<A>__{a laugh from jack. kate gives him a calm smile and a nod it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(resolute)}
<D>__{okay, i'm going...}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her tight. jack looks toward the gate, the line disappearing...kate grasps his shirt tightly.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i can't seem to let go of you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you hear me complaining about that?}
<A>__{a sober look in jack's eyes.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{look, we're at the airport and no one ever thinks clearly at the airport so we should just trust the decision we already made. you've been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country, i've got this internship at barclay's bank. we have a great plan, honey...}
<A>__{kate nods, then, with resolve...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you want to do something great, jack? let's flush the plan...start our lives right now, today...i don't know what that life's gonna look like but i do know it has both of us in it. and i choose us...}
<A>__{jack is jolted by her words.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{the plan doesn't make us great, jack. what we have together, that's what makes us great.}
<A>__{her words sink in...a long moment of decision...he looks toward the gate, only one person left in line...back to kate...imploring him with her eyes. finally...he kisses her deeply on the lips...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i love you, kate...}
<A>__{...a smile from kate...relief...then...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(taking her face in his hands)}
<D>__{...and a year in london's not gonna change that. a hundred years couldn't change that...}
<A>__{jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to look back. kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as the gate door closes behind him. she waits, almost willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it doesn't...}
