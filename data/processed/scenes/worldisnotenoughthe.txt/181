<A>__{on the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact, emitting one, monotone beep.... the watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. gabor, a radio earpiece in his ear, reports information.}
<C>__{gabor}
<D>__{it wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud. the trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{and bond?}
<A>__{an agonizing beat. the alarm beep sputters and dies.}
<C>__{gabor}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{m and elektra share a look.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{do you think he's dead?}
<A>__{m can't answer. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{we just have to wait.}
<A>__{m shifts. the hi tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red lights on every screen, showing the explosion.}

<P>__{(to m)}
<D>__{i have a gift for you. something that belonged to my father. he would have wanted you to have it.}
<A>__{m feels uneasy.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{perhaps this isn't the time...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{she hands m a small box. m unties the ribbon.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{he often spoke of how...compassionately you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping.}
<A>__{m opens the box. it is the eye of the glens...the heirloom pin, the original.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{it's very valuable, you know. i just couldn't let it explode with the rest of him.}
<A>__{m looks up, horrified, when: gabor and another security man shoot m's two guards in the head...point blank, cold blood. the men fall. m looks back at elektra, a blood curdling glare.}

<P>__{(to her men)}
<D>__{take her to the chopper.}
