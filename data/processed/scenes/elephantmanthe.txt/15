<C>__{anne}
<D>__{...freddie! what's the matter? you've been like this all evening.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh... i've just been thinking about something that man bytes said.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh, freddie. what could that wretched vampire say to upset you?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{that i am very little different from him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh that's absurd, frederick. no, no frederick, that's all wrong! john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. and, that is completely due to you.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{but why did i do it? what was this all for? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? or so i could become famous?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{frederick, just what is it that you are saying?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...am i a good man or am i a bad man?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh frederick.}

<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you're a good man. a very good man.}
<A>__{we see from treves' eyes that he is not reassured. basement the london it is very dark. there is a dim red glow coming from the holes in a furnace door. we hear a door open and footsteps coming downstairs. a man comes into the basement carrying something large and black. he approaches the furnace and opens the door. the man is treves. he is holding the stiff black surgeon's coat of which he was once so proud. he looks at it for a moment, and then stuffs it into the furnace. inside, the coat starts to smoke heavily, then bursts into flames. treves watches it burn, and then closes the door. hallway the london hospital we see carr gomm walking down the hall to his office. broadneck appears, going the other way.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{ahh! broadneck! you'll no doubt be pleased to know that we've received a smashing response to my letter. it's all very heartwarming, though several letters do mention how beastly it would be to part the poor fellow from mr. treves and the staff, but since the committee insists...}
<C>__{broadneck}
<P>__{(scowling)}
<D>__{good day, carr gomm.}
<A>__{broadneck walks on. carr gomm goes into his office. carr's office mothershead is standing by the desk looking through a small stack of mail.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{is this all there is for john?}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i'm afraid so, mrs. mothershead. perhaps tomorrow.}
