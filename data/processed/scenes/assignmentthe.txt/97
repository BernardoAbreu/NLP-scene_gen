<L>__{interior jeep night}
<A>__{we have a shot of the road, pov ramirez through the windshield. suddenly as we negotiate the hairpin turn, there up ahead of us sits jacks in the middle of the road tied to a chair, looking straight at us.}
<B>__{zoom to jack}
<A>__{sitting straight, tied into the chair so that he could not run if he wanted to. he doesn't move, just stares forward, as if trying to lock eyes with ramirez.}
<C>__{ramirez }
<P>__{(as his hand starts for brake)}
<D>__{you asshole!}
<B>__{high angle}
<A>__{the jeep turns slightly to the right, then sharply to the left. and as its back wheels lock, it slides and completes the 180 degree turn. just short of jack. close jack his face is white, his stare frozen. he has seen death before. never that close.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{ramirez jumps out of the jeep, coming straight at jack.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{you crazy assed mother fucker! i could have killed you!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you can't let down! this isn't a game... it is life and death. you have to be ready for anything, all the time.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{just then we hear the roar of the snowmobiles coming out of nowhere, bearing down towards them.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{the clip in your gun has three live, two dummy, one live, three dummy, one live.}
<A>__{ramirez looks at him, pushed to the breaking point now. he pulls the transmitter out of his pocket and crosses right to jack and stuffs it in jack's pocket.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{no rules, jack? then you fucking deal with it.}
<A>__{ramirez waits for jack to say something... to protest... to say anything. jack says nothing. ramirez turns in a fury and starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four different directions, coming straight towards jack. jack says absolutely nothing. ramirez turns and sees jack is making absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter. jack simply locks eyes with ramirez. jack is not going to budge. ramirez turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting jack grows louder. ramirez can take it no more. he turns, pulls out the gun and must run right to where jack is in order to get shots off at each snowmobile. he fires through the dummy rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles, the last of which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both. ramirez is exhausted. when jack speaks it is quietly and with contempt.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you pussy. you rule following pussy.}
<A>__{ramirez turns, looking at jack, unable to believe his ears.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know why you don't fuck around on your wife? not because you don't want to. you're a man. you want to fuck everything. but you don't... because you're afraid it would cost you what... your wife, your family, your self respect maybe...}
<A>__{as we watch ramirez listening to jack, we can see him going over the edge.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{...you know what carlos would do if he was married? he'd bring whatever woman he wanted home and make his wife fuck her. that's what no rules means. that's what you're too much of a pussy to get.}
<A>__{ramirez walks straight over to jack, pulls his hair back so that jack is staring up at him and then he puts the barrel of his gun at jack's temple. ramirez is not bluffing now. he has gone completely into the dark side for the first time.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{no rules, jack? okay... we're in a fucking foreign country on a secret mission... i can't be here, i'm on a submarine. the u.s. navy's my alibi. what's the count on my ammunition, jack? is this one live or a dud?}
<A>__{he stares down at jack and we can see that jack does not remember the count, as ramirez pulls the trigger. click!}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what about the next one, jack? live or dud... who cares... no rules, right?}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger. click!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(perversely proud)}
<D>__{yes, my good son...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{think you can be lucky three times in a row?}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger. click!}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{how about four?}
<A>__{he is about to pull the trigger once again when we hear:}
<C>__{amos }
<D>__{annibal! it's over!}
<A>__{ramirez turns to see him, as amos walks down the embankment towards him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{stay out of it.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{it's over, jack. he's it.}
<A>__{ramirez stays with the gun pointed at jack. it is obvious he is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze the trigger once again. amos takes the gun from ramirez, points it up and pulls the trigger... kaboom!}
