<L>__{interior visiting room san quentin correctional facility }
<B>__{ten months earlier}
<A>__{we look through a foggy window at wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them. there are a few visitors already sitting at tables with inmates. several corrections officers stand by. we see oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking through the glass window of the search room. a corrections officer is conducting a search. oscar's face is bruised under his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face. he turns around, bends over and coughs. he turns back around, and the officer hands him his blue shirt and pants. oscar puts them on and buzz. the door opens, and oscar walks through the large room to wanda's table. as he approaches she stands up.}

<C>__{wanda}
