<A>__{abigail emerges onto the gallery with zoe. she spots an alcove, indicates that zoe should hide. then she slips a silver stake into zoe's hand. just in case. abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at blade and drake. her view is obscured. she can't get a good shot.}

<A>__{drake digs his fangs into blade's shoulder. blade struggles, manages to slip a stake from his bandolier wham! blade slams the stake into drake's ear canal. the beast shrieks in pain, dropping blade. but all the gambit has done is drive drake into a berserker rage. drake swings his fist. blade ducks. drake's fist goes through the wall, puncturing a steam pipe. steam vents drake reaches in, rips an eight foot section of the pipe from the wall, bringing a sparking nest of electrical cables along with it. he swings the pipe section around, whacking blade. krunch! drake swings the makeshift club again. he's a one man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path. he's smashing holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through partitions of glass and steel.}
