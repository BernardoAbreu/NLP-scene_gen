<L>__{interior martin's house night}
<A>__{it's not as eerie with the lights on except for the fact there's a killer in it. martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{when.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{blomkvist's clothes. the fresh mud stains.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i fell in the dark.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you don't have a flashlight? i will give you one.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i just wasn't being careful.}
<A>__{martin smiles, but blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one. martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight. the knife block with one missing is right there.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how's the investigation?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{nothing new to report.}
<A>__{blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini maglite in the drawer.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{dirch says ms. salander is clever. maybe she'll turn something up.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{martin hands blomkvist the mini maglite.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{thanks.}
