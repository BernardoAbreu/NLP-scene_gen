<A>__{he nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself. they look at each other across the empty elevator, both leaning against the walls. the elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good night. they kiss like you would on the cheek but it's closer to their mouths. the door shuts he missed his floor. the elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. they kiss good night again and she gets out before the door closes. he watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall.}
