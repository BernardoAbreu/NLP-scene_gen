<L>__{interior thelma's motel room night}
<A>__{j.d. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still undone and no shirt. he has an incredible physique. he also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety. thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from a vending machine and is into her second wild turkey and 7 up. she sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror. he definitely looks better with his shirt off. she suddenly feels awkward and stands up.}
