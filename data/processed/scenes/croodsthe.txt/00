<T>__{to:}
<A>__{cave paintings of a family of cavemen we will come to know them as the croods.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{with every sun comes a new day. a new beginning. a hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.}
<A>__{the croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food. scared. fast. the croods are chased by beasts across the desert. they escape from creatures up trees. they hide behind rocks.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{but not for me. my name's eep. this, is my family, the croods. if you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads we're cavemen. most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. night after night, day after day. yep. home sweet home. when we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. and i struggled to survive my family.}

<C>__{eep }
<D>__{we were the last ones around. there used to be neighbors. the gorts, smashed by a mammoth. the horks, swallowed by a sand snake. the erfs, mosquito bite. throgs, common cold. and, the croods. that's us. the croods made it...}
<A>__{grug protects his family from a giant bear owl.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{because of my dad. he was strong... and he followed the rules.}

<C>__{eep }
<D>__{... the ones painted on the cave walls. anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. basically, anything fun is bad. welcome to my world.}
<A>__{they all run back into the cave where grug slams the rock door closed. slowly light on cave paintings comes up again. but this time the light casts an ominous tone.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{but this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.}
<B>__{rapid shots of the great split cutting through the land. headed towards crood valley.}
<A>__{shots of cataclysm. cut faster and faster until:}
<B>__{...}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. and there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.}
<A>__{caveman hands press against the rock wall. they push. a blinding light floods the screen.}
