<L>__{interior woodburn construction front offices day}
<A>__{a half dozen calitri soldiers are here, answering phones, playing cards.}
<L>__{interior woodburn construction workshop}
<A>__{the sliding door is open. the casket for kip rests to the side ... calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a plywood gossip bench. he senses something and turns to the loading dock memphis has driven up in the smashed to shit eleanor ... he climbs up, entering the workshop... calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55}
<B>__{am...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{well, well. you've caused quite a ruckus ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{this is number 50. we did it. it's over where's the money ?}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{right there }
<A>__{he gestures to a haliburton case ... memphis opens it ... there's a lot of cash inside...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{200 k. just like we said ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{but i had to. it was the only way to get to you }
<A>__{memphis looks at him... calitri smiles ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{well, now, he's clear. and you'll stay away from him...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{i don't know about that, randall. he did such a good job on this paper. and another one just came in ...}
<A>__{calitri goes to the fax machine... tears off the sheet..}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{it's an easier take. 30 cars. two weeks. most of them suvs. going to russia. think kip'll be interested?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you don't want to even sniff at that }
<A>__{calitri grins. but then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the first time eleanor parked out on the loading dock. and she is smashed to shit.}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{well, that certainly won't do.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{what do you mean ?}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{look at it. i can't very well make delivery of that thing ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you got no choice. it's over.}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{fifty cars. fifty cars by 8 am friday. or kip goes in that box. that was the deal ... goddamn, it ... that was the deal ...}
<A>__{memphis is by a table saw... he flicks it on. the electric motor rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{what are you doing ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{tell you what i'm not doing: i'm not gonna let you get into my kool aid...}
<A>__{and memphis is on him... they go rolling about in grunts and groans eddies of sawdust swirling the noise of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat ... calitri is on top, grabbing an awl from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to memphis' face... memphis holds calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye angle floor socket right above memphis' head. with a last gasp, memphis misdirects the awl so it stabs the floor socket a small clap of voltage shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ... both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... calitri is up; and he's found the gun ... he crawls over to memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest ... but then memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses calitri off him ... memphis pounds calitri's head into the floor ... once, twice. three times. calitri is out ... memphis gets to his feet, nose bloody. he catches his breath. only the door opens ... and atley is there ...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{jesus, man ... what'd you do?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{my version of "take this job and shove it..."}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{are you crazy? you throw down with the carpenter? you got a grudge against your life?}
<A>__{but before memphis can respond, there are approaching engine sounds from up the alleyway as a panel van arrives. memphis and atley look at the wall clock. 8:05. a glance to the unconscious calitri ...}
<C>__{atley jackson }
<D>__{now you done it. and with you gone who'll save kip the next time ... ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{this is all about there not being a next time, atley }
<A>__{and the two men hold the look... and the van doors slam, as digger and butz, calitri's grave diggers, get out ... atley goes to the unconscious calitri ... and he picks him up, straining under the dead weight ... dragging the don over to the open casket one final burst of strength and atley drops calitri into the casket... slamming the swell top lid of the coffin. he turns to look at the shocked memphis as digger and butz are there }
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{hello, boys !}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{hey! what happened? did they make it}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{they did not. a tragedy.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{mr. c. around?}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{he's napping. he said to take it away...}
<A>__{atley gestures to the coffin. and they pick it up, move it to the van...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{that'll do ya. tell mr. c. we was by.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{and they are gone ... and atley turns to memphis}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{ding dong the witch is dead, right?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{point five ...}
<A>__{and he holds out his hand ... and they shake ...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{get outta here, memphis }
<A>__{and memphis does ... nods to atley...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{thank you...}
<A>__{atley nods ... memphis walks out to the loading dock... atley watches him go ...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{hoo boy.}
