<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{hey, i was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'don't tread on me'. you know, and a picture of the earth.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{don't tread on the earth?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{how do you not tread on the earth? i mean, you kind of have to.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i never thought of that.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i gotta bail. you coming?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you guys blow. i'm waiting on cassandra. she's gonna help me with my history.}

<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{are you going out with jeffrey tonight?}
<C>__{buffy}

<A>__{jennifer laughs, uncomfortably.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't worry, jennifer. someday your prince will come.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yeah, just make sure you do first. let's go, guys.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{b'bye.}
<A>__{the other girls leave. buffy is alone on the empty field. she looks around her. she starts doing a routine, tentatively. then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels. she rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect ten, about three inches from merrick. she screams in surprise, steps back.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{god, where the hell did you come from? you scared me to death.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was impressive. the... tumbling.}
<A>__{his accent is clipped british.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{what? oh. i used to do gymnastics. are you looking for someone?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm looking for you, actually.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{am i in trouble or something?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{not at all. my name is merrick. i was sent to find you some time ago. i should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. you should have been taught, prepared.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i've searched the entire world for you, buffy.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{to bring you... your birthright.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{my birthright? you mean, like a trust fund?}
<A>__{merrick looks at her.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i had a trust fund my great grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and i spent it on shoes.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you must come with me. it's much too late already. you must come with me to the graveyard.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{wait a minute. my birthright is in the graveyard? later not.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. forget you. my, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you don't understand. you have been chosen.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{chosen to go to the graveyard? why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you must believe me. you must come with me while there's still time.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{time to do what?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{to stop the killing. to stop the vampires.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{let me get this straight. you're like, this greasy bum, and i have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause i'm chosen, and there's vampires.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{does elvis talk to you? tell you to do things? do you see spots?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i don't have time for your prattling. i have proof. you bear the mark.}
<A>__{he steps forward and pulls the neck of buffy's shirt aside, revealing her shoulder.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the mark of the coven! the where's the mark?}
<A>__{there is no birthmark on her shoulder. he looks at the other one.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the mark of the wait a minute.}
<A>__{buffy pushes his hand off her.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you mean that big hairy mole? excuse me: eeyuu. i had it removed. and, like, knowing about my big old mole isn't proof of anything except that it's way past medication time.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{just stay away from me, okay?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{did you ever dream that you were someone else?}
<A>__{buffy stops. this obviously registers with her.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{everybody does.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{in the past. a girl. maybe... a magyar peasant. an indian princess. a slave.}
<A>__{the last one hits the mark.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i was a slave.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{in virginia.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i don't know. it was... there was a big gram or something. and there's one, i'm like a prostitute...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{china.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, my god. i never told anybody about this. i remember the one about the peasant, too. god, there's a bunch. is this, like channeling or something.}
<A>__{merrick rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i had a dream once where i was... there was like, knights in it, and i worked in this bar. and i... was fighting. i'm always fighting. and there's a guy... he's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{lothos.}
<A>__{the name has an obvious effect on the girl.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{how do you know all this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i have to show you.}
