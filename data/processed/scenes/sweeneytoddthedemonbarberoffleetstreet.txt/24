<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{todd and mrs. lovett are walking away from the marketplace. she chatters happily:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{... like to give me a coronary right there! what if he had recognized you! lord, my heart was beating a mile a minute, just like a little finch it was. aren't those lovely birds now? always so twittery and happy...}
<A>__{she continues chattering... but todd is not listening. his eyes dart to the side to see the gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle, insinuating...}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{sweeney pondered and sweeney planned. like a perfect machine 'e planned...}
<A>__{the banker moves in next to the gentleman...}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{barbing the hook, baiting the trap, setting it out for the beadle to snap...}
<A>__{the general joins them...}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{slyly courted 'im, sweeney did, set a sort of a scene 'e did... gentleman, banker and general laying the trail, showing the traces, letting it lead to higher places... sweeney...}
<A>__{the last word echoes ... and then they are gone ... disappearing from todd's mind ... swallowed up by the crowd of pedestrians... todd looks to mrs. lovett and she continues chattering:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{... suppose it's just me gentle heart, but i do hate to see a boy treated like that, no better than your aunt doreen's dog mr. todd, are you listening to me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{but then his eyes dart again looking for the specters. he only sees strangers.}
