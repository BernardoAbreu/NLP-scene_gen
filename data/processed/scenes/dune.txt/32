<A>__{gurney activates his body shield, sending a shimmering force field around his body. he advances swiftly toward paul. paul snaps on his force field, draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself hurriedly for the fight.}
<C>__{gurney}
<P>__{(his voice sounding strange through the forcefield)}
<D>__{guard yourself for true!}
<A>__{gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious attack. paul falls back. the shield edges crack loudly as they touch each other.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{what's gotten into gurney? he's not faking.}
<A>__{paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. the smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and spark off one another. paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin gurney against the table top with his blade right at gurney's neck.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(strange shielded voice)}
<D>__{is this what you seek?}
<C>__{gurney}
<P>__{(strange shielded voice)}
<D>__{good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.}
<A>__{paul looks and sees gurney's blade at his groin.}
<C>__{gurney }
<D>__{we'd have joined each other in death. however, you did seem to finally get the "mood".}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{would you really have drawn my blood?}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{if you'd fought one whit below your abilities i'd have scratched you a good one.}
