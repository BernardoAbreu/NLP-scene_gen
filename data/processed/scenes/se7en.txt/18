<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, kitchen night}
<A>__{the police photographer packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag. somerset and mills enter. mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves. the grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in. the photographer exits:}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{bon appetit.}
<A>__{the only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling. the light bathes an obese man who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair, face down dead in a plate of spaghetti. the sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates. the plates hold bits of half eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk food remnants. mills and somerset turn on their flashlights. mills points his at the green bulb above. aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse. somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight. he goes to the body and kneels beside it. there's a rope tied around the man's wide gut. mills comes to stand beside somerset.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i guess that makes it homicide.}
<A>__{somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead man's pants cuffs. rope is tied around the purplish ankle. mills examines the knots behind the chair's back. shines his flashlight on the man's belly.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{still, he could have tied himself in. to make it look like murder.}
<A>__{somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse. he studies the man's head and neck without touching.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{i don't see any blood or bruises yet. no wounds. you see anything?}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff hands are clutching utensils. a knife in the left hand, a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered. cockroaches swarm. mills turns to the sink and stove. each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it. there's food slopped everywhere.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right?}
<A>__{somerset walks to the room's only window. the window has been painted over with black painterior he touches the window with his pinkie finger. the paint is still wet. mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator. the trash can is full to the brim with empty food containers.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{so, this guy took this big knife... and he held it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into the wall. cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back.}
<A>__{mills opens the refrigerator. it's nearly empty.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{except, he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{if you could... spare me the anecdotes for now. leave the refrigerator open for the light.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, forgive me. i thought we had this male bonding thing going. my mistake.}
<A>__{somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought. his flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food running from the stove to the table.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{what do you smell? other than him, and all the food.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sniffs)}
<D>__{i don't know... there's something.}
<A>__{somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{a bucket.}
<A>__{somerset points the flashlight and mills crouches, pulls up the tablecloth on his side of the table. two large dead rats lay on the floor beside a metal bucket. mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the rats. he looks in the bucket. he leans back, baffled.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it's vomit.}
<A>__{he looks at somerset under the table.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{it's a bucket of vomit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{is there any blood in it?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{can't tell by looking.}
<A>__{somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man. there is a knock at the door. the detectives look to doctor thomas o'neill, 52, the medical examiner. o'neill is a frumpy man, seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{mood lighting. very sixties.}
<A>__{he drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{you think he was poisoned?}
<A>__{mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{and, those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{guessing this early is useless.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{you girls have got the forensics guys out there chompin' at the bit. don't know if we'll all fit in here though.}
<A>__{mills continues searching the garbage.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{there's room. light's the problem.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{well, three is certainly a crowd in here. and, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{detective mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(not pleased)}
<D>__{thanks, but no thanks. i will stay on this.}
<A>__{somerset watches o'neill at the corpse. o'neill points a thin flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{send one forensic in on your way out.}
<A>__{mills is pissed. he lifts his flashlight to shine it on the side of somerset's face. a moment passes. somerset looks at mills, light shining directly in somerset's eyes. a longer moment. mills switches the light off. he leaves. o'neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{he is dead.}
