<A>__{alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in her underwear.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i think it looks natural.}
<A>__{a peach colored dildo dangles stiffly from alike's waist. the harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts. alike appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots laura a look.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm serious, i mean it doesn't look that bad.}
<C>__{alike}

<D>__{ok, ok i won't tell. daag!}
<A>__{alike tosses the case at sharonda who scrambles to catch it. alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind her headboard. sharonda saunters out into the hallway.}
<C>__{sharonda}
<D>__{i'm still tellin'}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{tellin' what?}
<A>__{audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway, still dressed for work, shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{noth }
<C>__{sharonda}
<D>__{she took my makeup again.}

<A>__{audrey fixes laura with another hard glance and shoos sharonda down the hallway. laura starts to shut the door, but audrey stops it with her arm.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i think we'll just leave this open. let some air circulate in here.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i was just about to leave, anyway. so...}
<A>__{audrey lingers, looking back and forth between laura and alike. alike frowns at her mother. satisfied that the conversation is over, audrey moves off toward her room. laura checks to make sure she's gone and whispers to alike.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{just try it.}
