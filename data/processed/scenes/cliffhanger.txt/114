<D>__{hop in. i know someone who'd like to see you again before he dies.}
<L>__{exterior bottom of the slope qualen}
<A>__{moves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood in the snow. gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a bonus. qualen moves out lakeside nothing visible but the thick, flat ice chunks circling in the currents. but gabe's footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge. qualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down qualen's pov the bridge's planks the blood and slush from gabe's boots end halfway across.}
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{smiles and shakes his head. too obvious. gabe is hiding underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel supports. qualen slows his pace, staring down through the thin, but visible cracks between the planks. tight close up gabe's face grimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge.}
<C>__{qualen }
<D>__{you've come a long way to die.}
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{enjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun.}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{if you were smart, you'd have left your friend behind. i would have. there's no shame in staying alive.}
<A>__{qualen stops, staring down. through the gaps, gabe's parka is visible. right where the blood trail ends.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(aims down)}
<D>__{but you're not smart. and now you're going to die from an overdose of heroism.}
<A>__{qualen blazes the gun into the planks under the bridge gabe is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge, several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being shredded by the fusillade without the parka, gabe is freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for comfort as they ricochet on the bridge's supports }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{stops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of toothpicks at this point qualen bends down and sees there's nothing in the parka except for gabe's back. qualen's face registers anger and surprise as gabe appears at the edge of the hole before qualen can react, gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the shoulder strap of qualen's machine gun gabe yanks down, and qualen falls head first}
<B>__{under the bridge}
<A>__{with gabe qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a leg on one of the steel supports but both}

<B>__{in the supports}
<A>__{gabe pulls himself through the girders to qualen and punches him with his good arm, but qualen is unfazed neither are in good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym qualen steadies himself to savagely punch gabe in his shoulder wound gabe yells in pain and tries to block the next one, but qualen punches him again, and gabe lets go of the support, falling on the way down, gabe grabs qualen's leg with his good hand too low to grab the bridge, gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as qualen tries to kick him off gabe holds onto qualen's leg, and swings on it like a pendulum gabe twists the leg qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go both}
<B>__{qualen and gabe}
<A>__{fall they land hard, not in the water, but on a raft sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the current. their weight teeter totters the ice as they get up they're in danger not just from each other, but from}
<B>__{the fast approaching whirlpool}
<A>__{where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling vortex that drains into the waterfall }
<B>__{on the ice raft}
<A>__{qualen and gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the ice itself swirls in the current if either makes the wrong move, they'll both go over. gabe swings at qualen, but qualen throws a leg under gabe and stiff arms him down gabe hits the ice hard, his chest hanging over the side qualen moves in to shove him off but their combined weight on the same side of the ice starts to tip it over gabe viciously kicks qualen back, gashing his face with his boot's crampon as qualen grabs the ice raft's opposite side, levelling it.}

<P>__{(winded)}

<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{far more intimidating when it's loaded.}
<A>__{the chunk of ice with gabe's ice axe floats by gabe gabe grabs for it, but misses as the ice raft spins around, qualen manages to snatch it up qualen scythes it down at gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as gabe rolls away wider view the ice raft is nearing the center of the whirlpool the current is faster and stronger here if it doesn't swallow the ice raft, it will definitely upend it }
<B>__{qualen and gabe}
<A>__{stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance qualen swings out at gabe with the axe. gabe ducks and tries to go low to hit qualen with the gun, but qualen swings the axe down again, whizzing right past gabe as it sinks into }

<A>__{ a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed sized chunk of ice floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by digging his crampons in just as }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of ice to make the same move to sees one just out of reach. qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the other chunk closer in as he does, the entire raft disintegrates under him qualen plunges into the water, and tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left but now at the center of the whirlpool, qualen is drawn into the vortex }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing gabe's pov qualen going down qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as he shoots down to the bottom of the lake and beyond qualen's pov underwater qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the lake's tunnel drain on the mountain wall the waterfall blasts out full force, hurling a still thrashing qualen a half a mile to the ground below!}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{has no time to celebrate the chunk of ice he's on leaves him moments from the same fate. one more time around, and it's down the drain. gabe takes a deep breath. no choice. he leaps wider view the ice gabe leaping from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you would across stones in a stream, zig zagging to catch the ones big enough to support him only his crampons keep him from sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. no choice gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge supports his hand catches but it's slippery and he's weakened gabe slides off, but }

<A>__{reaches down and grabs him }
<B>__{hal}
