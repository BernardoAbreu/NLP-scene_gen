<L>__{exterior brothel. night.}
<A>__{will comes staggering out into the street.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it was i who killed him! god forgive me, god forgive me!}
<A>__{he falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water and garbage. he gets up and staggers on.}
<L>__{exterior church tower. night.}
<A>__{a church tower looms up in the night sky.}
<L>__{interior church. night.}
<A>__{this is where will has come. the church is empty, but for the demented, grieving figure of shakespeare, kneeling, praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by effigies of the dead and images of his redeemer. he is wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.}
<L>__{exterior de lessepses' house. day.}
<A>__{a lovely sunny morning. the church bells are ringing. viola and the nurse, mounted, approach. viola rides sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather like quixote by sancho, by the nurse on a less impressive animal. riding in the opposite direction, is wessex. and what a happy day it is. he sings and hums to himself merrily. here is a man who has heard wonderful news. he sees viola and greets her merrily.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{you look sad, my lady! let me take you riding.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{it is not my riding day, my lord.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{bless me, i thought it was a horse.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{i am going to church.}
<C>__{wessex}
<P>__{(recomposing his features to solemnity)}
<D>__{i understand of course. it is to be expected.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{it is to be expected on a sunday.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{and on a day of mourning. i never met the fellow but once at your house.}
<C>__{viola}
<P>__{(cannot take this in)}
<D>__{mourning? who is dead, my lord?}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{oh! dear god, i did not think it would be me to tell you. a great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.}
<A>__{viola almost faints. the nurse steadies her.}
<C>__{viola}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{he is dead?}
<C>__{wessex}
<P>__{(cheerfully solemn)}
<D>__{killed last night, in a tavern! come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul}
<A>__{viola gives a silent cry. the nurse is speaking to her in distress.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{my lady...my lady...now is the time to show your breeding.}
