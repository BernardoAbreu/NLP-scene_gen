<P>__{(uncharacteristically angry)}
<D>__{nice going, ray! what were you trying to do drown me?}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(unusually mean)}
<D>__{look, zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.}
<C>__{winston}
<P>__{(shoves him)}
<D>__{you better watch your mouth, man, or i will punch your lights out.}

<C>__{winston}
<D>__{what are we doing? ray, i was ready to kill you.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{don't you see? it's the slime. that stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.}
