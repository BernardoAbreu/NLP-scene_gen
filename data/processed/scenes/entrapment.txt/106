<L>__{exterior nathan road early morning}
<A>__{with gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry all across her shoulder. very early, even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour. up ahead... ...tsimshatsui station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag, leaning casually against a pole. talking into a cellular. as she approaches, mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear his conversation...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...if i can't have my usual suite, i will take my business to the bristol, simple as that.}
<A>__{he sees her now. smiles small.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...why indeed should i be more loyal to you than you've been to me? think it over.}
<A>__{snaps the phone shut.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you ran your calls.}
<A>__{she did. she is frankly exhilarated.}
<D>__{gin all the transactions, all the transfers. it's a miracle.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why? the cd erased the trans actions, all accounts seem in order. it looks like the thieves were stopped in time.}
<A>__{she sighs. it is a miracle.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the colonel says police have nothing. a man in black tie, a blonde in a gown. the elevator guards saw faces, but no mug shots to id. i think it's over.}
<A>__{mac's smile. bittersweet affection.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{except it never is, really. quite. over.}
<A>__{she smiles. it is easy, but dazzling. atypically soft.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{well, one hopes not. the bristol, huh? in...paris?}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you're not going back to mr. cruz, and the nine to five?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{not hardly. i've arranged to be killed in a car crash. on taipei. amazing how little it costs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. you want to watch those pennies.}
<A>__{she takes a breath. scared, in an excited way...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i could arrange for two. in that crash.}
<A>__{his smile back. he looks at his watch. takes her hand. leads her to the subway steps.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you know, for a bitch. you can be awfully sweet.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{woman of mystery. what do you say? i like the bristol, just fine. mean, it's not the ritz...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you know, all night i've been wrestling with something...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{not the most flattering way to put it.}
<A>__{he takes his big tourist shopping bag. puts it in her hand.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i've changed your travel plans.}
<A>__{they are descending now. into the vast underground train station.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at jordan station for kowloon tong. got that?}
<A>__{got that?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{jordan is only 90 seconds up the line. like a wire transfer, you're gone. vanished.}
<A>__{he holds up a silencing finger. listen to me.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{in this bag are passports, tickets, papers. an amber wig, a good one. a dress you can slip on in five seconds.}
<A>__{her eyes moving over his face. what is this?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you're on a tight connection to the trans siberian express, be in europe in a week.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{mac, wh...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{shhh. you always talk too much.}
<A>__{they're at the booth. he pays their fare. through the turnstiles, now.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{time has come to return the favor. one last time.}
<A>__{smiles at her. as they enter a tunnel.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{tell you. what business. i'm actually in.}
<A>__{and in an instant of blind panicked clarity. she gets the whole thing.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{my god. you're a cop.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{keep walking. people are everywhere. but they are alone in the world.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{see, my profession was cover, too. a notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans...}
<A>__{he sighs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i've turned in...well, couple hundred. over forty years. scotland yard, interpol, fbi...}
<A>__{looking around the tunnel.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{thought i might retire. after you.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and all the...microchips, the diamond machine...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well, the chips were returned. the machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real?}
<A>__{glances at her.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i thought...everything was real. stupid girl.}
<A>__{end of the tunnel in sight now. it leads to a massive, endless quai. trains in transit.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{those were your jobs, so i could have claimed entrapment. you had to wait. for mine.}
<A>__{nearly there. he says nothing. looks pretty grim.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the oracle bone...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well, the state department liked that one. they have more fish to fry with beijing than taiwan.}
<A>__{he sighs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{so they're taking credit for letting it go through. tho i'm afraid your colonel may be in for a career disappointment.}
<A>__{she stops walking. she has to know...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and the 5 billion.}
<A>__{ah. that.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i haven't told them.}
<A>__{gently, takes her arm. leads her onto the endless train platform. walking slower now.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i said you hadn't revealed the job. that it wouldn't take place until after the changeover.}
<A>__{down the platform they stroll. as her eyes wander...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{don't look, they're there.}
<A>__{her breath catches. her eyes go down.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and my tickets. in the shopping bag?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. kept my options open. if i give you up, they don't matter, do they?}
<A>__{her heart pounding through her chest.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{if.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{had lots of crazy thoughts. one was retirement. with four billion dollars. after all, i know some places where life could be private...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{but you couldn't do that, huh?}
<A>__{they've stopped. just two travellers in a strange land. waiting for a train.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{otherwise. they wouldn't be here.}
<A>__{he nods. smiling pleasantly.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{creature of habit. i suppose.}
<A>__{we feel her adrenaline racing.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{lots. of thoughts, you s...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{keep smiling. they won't move, until i raise my left arm.}
<A>__{and so she smiles. as prettily as she can manage.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i thought. well, i've got the cd. i could contact the banks, reverse all the transactions...}
<A>__{a train is coming. we hear it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...except maybe. leave you with... oh, a hundred million, say. to tide you over.}
<A>__{see the train. slowing. pulling in.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{then, i thought, nah. not my style.}
<A>__{with a shriek of metal. the train pulls toward us.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i figured. what the hell?}
<A>__{what the hell?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let her keep the lot.}
<A>__{the train stops. the doors open. people come out, people go in. pouring around them. they are alone again. the subway doors stand open. two feet away. she looks at them...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no rush. the doors won't close for 60 seconds.}
<A>__{sixty seconds. and still smiling...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{there's a pistol in the bag. reach in slowly. take it out fast. point it at my temple.}
<A>__{she freezes to stone.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can do it. if i say you can.}
<A>__{and she...does it. a blinding move, the gun straight at his head, mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we... whip pan to see. half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close. they react, pull their weapons, but it's a stand off. back to... two people. alone in the universe.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on my face.}
<A>__{she hesitates. does as he says. passengers are screaming, cringing, bolting for other cars. our world is frozen. his hands raised...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{seems i was wrong.}
<A>__{gentle smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{entrapment. is what robbers. do to cops, huh?}
<A>__{her eyes are flooding. the gun is trembling.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{twenty seconds. shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down.}
<A>__{her pistol is shaking like she has palsy. tears are on her cheeks.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oughta shoot you in the face.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{come on, you can do it, if i sa...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no way. not anymore.}
<A>__{she sobs. she can't stand this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ten seconds, hold on.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{when do i see you?}
<A>__{there is no answer. there are no words. the doors hiss shut. she stares, training her pistol on him through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents, and the train... pulls away. an instant to pick up speed, and it roars into a tunnel. gone. mac stands motionless as all hell breaks loose around him, agents rushing to his side, mac shaking his head, calmly... still staring after the train.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{airport. changing at mongkok station, we can cut her off.}
<A>__{walkie talkies whip out. these guys are the same the world over. we begin to crane up...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{she might lose the wig, be looking brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{i think yaumatei changes for the airport, and it's closer.}
<A>__{keep pulling up, an aerial view now, too high to see their faces...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{i think you're wrong, but cover it. you got maybe four minutes.}
<A>__{higher still, the mob below an ant colony...}
<P>__{mac (o.s., calmly)}
<D>__{no problem. she's trapped.}
<A>__{but as the crowd parts. we can make out one lone man... staring after. what has gone.}
