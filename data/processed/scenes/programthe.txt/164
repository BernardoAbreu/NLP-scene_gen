<A>__{joe later stadium hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, winters watching from below.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{joe at sunset stadium bone weary now. winters has him run 20 yards, get down and do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc. joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only do 4. winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to run again.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{70 guys. 70 guys who busted their butts all year. because of you they might not win the conference. because of you they might not go to a bowl.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(barely able to stand)}
<D>__{i didn't wanna leave... i just screwed up...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you dogged on them.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(stopping, exhausted)}
<D>__{no, no i never dogged. i worked my ass off. i played hard...}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(pushing him forward)}
<D>__{then you shoulda stayed in shape. keep runnin', dammit.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(wobbling, starting to break down)}
<D>__{i always played hard. i gave my everything for you. when you came to the center, i thought you were really worried about me. but you don't give a shit. we're all just a buncha sled dogs. if you had another guy who could throw, you'da left me in the fuckin' hospital.}
<P>__{(falling to his knees, sobbing)}
<D>__{the only thing that matters is the program, the god damn program.}
<A>__{winters pushes joe down to do his pushups. joe has to strain mightily to do two.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{nobody forced you to play football, joe. not me, not the program, nobody. but when you sign on, you commit yourself to pay the price, to do whatever it takes. well, you haven't paid the price yet. you still owe this team. you owe this team big time.}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{get a shower.}
<A>__{joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as winters continues to walk away.}
