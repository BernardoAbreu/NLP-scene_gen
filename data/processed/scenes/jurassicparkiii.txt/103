<A>__{a full moon passes behind clouds. thunder quietly rumbles, and lightning flickers in the distance. paul is still at the wheel. the river is narrower here, and cautions must be taken to avoid the banks. as the barge begins to round another bend. a familiar high pitched sound pierces the darkness. muffled but unmistakable, it is the ringing sat phone. all exchange looks of sheer panic, expecting spinosaurus to leap out at any moment. grant scans the river banks.}

<A>__{paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand posed for action. the barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows louder. the suspense is excruciating until finally... their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying than anything they've yet seen. seven mounds of dinosaur dung sit on the patch off treeless flat ground just beyond the river bank. as our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them almost simultaneously. with eric still in the boat, amanda, paul, and alan jump into the river and rush to the bank.}
