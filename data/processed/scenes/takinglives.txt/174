<D>__{mr. hart, not asher, murdered the montreal inspector, correct?}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{yes. hart thought costa was systematically destroying his life. hart's violent explosion was inevitable.}

<D>__{how could asher plan on hart snapping like that?}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{he couldn't. my guess is asher intended to kill hart and make it look like suicide. the authorities would find the body and close the martin asher file.}
