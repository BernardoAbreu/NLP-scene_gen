<L>__{interior mini mart night}
<A>__{luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves. the chime bings. he peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight. michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey. how are you?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i'm okay. you?}
<A>__{as they talk, michelle maneuvers to get closer. luke maneuvers to keep his distance.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay. you look really nice.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{thanks. i was hopin' you might call.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i was going to.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{there's something i need to talk to you about. but did i do something wrong?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. nothin' like that. there's just some stuff i've got to sort out.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{they gaze at each other across the magazine rack, a mountain range of silence between them,...}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{there's nothing you can't tell me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{me too. what did you want to talk to me about?}
<A>__{they stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{nothing really. so, heard you and max really got into it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. i kind a' lost it.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{he knows how to push buttons, huh? what exactly did he say that got you so pissed off?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't know. we'd just finished a game. i was all revved up.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{he's actually a really nice guy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not sure he's too crazy about me seein' his sister.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{did he scare you off?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, he doesn't "scare" me. what, his struttin' around, thinkin' he's such a bad ass, with his shirt hangin' open half the time?}
<A>__{luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words. michelle steps away, confused.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{it's just an act. he likes pretending he's joe cool. always says you gotta' just be whatever you want, and fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, he's a joke alright.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{look, i'm not sure this is gonna' work out.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean }
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no. i can't do this. i'm not sure you even know who you are. much less who i am. have you ever even had a girlfriend?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, if you think my brother's such a "joke," how much better could you think of me? we're not that different, you know?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're totally different. he's a guy, for one.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and he's my best friend. if you don't like him, you can't like me.}
<A>__{she exits. mini mart later luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted, fidgety, distressed. he glances up at the magazine rack. a female fitness magazine catches his attention. the beautiful cover model seems to move. he stares at it: no movement. luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover. as he steps away, he glances back at the rack,}
<B>__{celebrity magazine cover}
<A>__{the adonis on the cover comes to life. he rips off his shirt as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he passionately kisses the bikini clad cover model.}
<B>__{magazine rack}
<A>__{the models and others on half a dozen covers begin stripping down, moving to other magazines and making out with each other all across the rack. outside the mini mart the windows glow among the dark trees. inside, luke rips up covers, hurling magazine after magazine across the floor.}
