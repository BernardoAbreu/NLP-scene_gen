<L>__{interior carl's cabin later}
<A>__{close on a battery well. one battery sits in place, one spot is empty. and... ...crash! the butt end of a fishing gaff bangs against the metal flange. again. again. again. and as the next blow is struck, the huge hand... ...slips, and the soft metal slices carl's flesh across his palm. he stops. then smashes away, twice more. we pull back to see... ...two batteries lie above the well. carl sucks the blood from his cut. then lifts kabuo's d 6 into place...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{don't know how long it's take to get a charge...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{keep it tonight. we'll catch fish. i will see ya back on the docks...}
<A>__{kabuo takes his gaff. heedless of carl's blood on the butt end. carl looks up, still crouching above his well.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{hold on. you know as well as i do, we got somethin' to talk about.}
<A>__{no response from kabuo. he stands above the larger man. silent, neutral. waiting.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{seven acres. i'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. just curious, is all.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{what are you sellin' 'em for? why don't we start there.}
<A>__{which makes the big man smile. just a little.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{did i say i was selling? but if i was, i'd have to figure you want 'em real bad. oughta charge a sall fortune, maybe...}
<A>__{a slight shrug. of giant shoulders.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{then again. maybe you'd want your battery back.}
<A>__{kabuo doesn't grin back. his face shows nothing at all.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{the battery's in, that's done with. besides, you'd do the same for m...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... might do the same. i have to warn you 'bout that, chief. i'm not screwed together like i used to be.}
<A>__{kabuo's face remains impassive. patient. and the big man squints up into it. holding a handkerchief to his injured hand.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hell, i'm sorry, okay? about the whole damn mess. if i'd a been around, my mother wouldn't a pulled it off that way.}
<A>__{he is sorry. and with that, kabuo's face eases. becomes like carl's own.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{i was out there at sea. fightin' you jap sons a bitches.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i'm an american. did i call you a nazi, you big nazi bastard?}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{not that i recall.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i killed men who looked just like you, pig fed german bastards. and their blood don't wash off so easy.}
<A>__{still no smile. carl staring up.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{so don't talk to me about japs, you big nazi son of a bitch.}
<A>__{carl laughs. and kabuo chuckles, right along with him. having kept his poker face the longer.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i am a bastard. i'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch. and i still got your bamboo fishing rod.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{oh, yeh?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hid it from my mom. caught a mess a sea runs. damn thing's still in my closet.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{you can have it. the hell with it.}
<A>__{the look between them now. is very wonderful. in the subtlety of its connection.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{$1200 an acre, that's what i paid ole, won't take a dime less. you got no choice on that.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{didn't say i was buyin' did i? what you want down? just bein' curious, is all.}
<A>__{the handkerchief comes away from carl's palm. and rising, his hand extends toward the smaller man.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{a thousand down. we'll sign papers t'morrow.}
<A>__{the hands grip. and they hold. and the length of this clasp, and the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment. wash years away.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{eight hundred. and it's a deal.}
