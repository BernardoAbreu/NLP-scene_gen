<A>__{he covers her mouth. riddick's pov: water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise. a predator drinks there.}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(on his breath)}
<D>__{doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....}
<A>__{riddick's pov: another predator lands to drink. then another. their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place. soon they all can hear clicking above the rain. their nightmare is far from over.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{get behind me.}
<A>__{riddick's pov: of a half dozen predators shifting places at the pool. a slim gap appears.}

<D>__{when i go, we go. full throttle.}
<A>__{close on their hands, gripping each other.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{ready...ready....}
<A>__{riddick's pov: the gap between predators widens into a passage. a gauntlet within a gauntlet. riddick runs . linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly. riddick's pov: of a predator turning to "stare" over its shoulder. predator's pov: of riddick bearing down fast. the survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach... the muddy rise. audrey loses her grip on the others... and starts back sliding . she cries out, turning the head of... riddick. he catches audrey as her legs hit the pool. he muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her slip sliding down the other side.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{you know the way!}
<A>__{not waiting for him, fry and imam disappear over the rise. riddick's pov: of the predators. regrouping. crawling up the rise at us.}
