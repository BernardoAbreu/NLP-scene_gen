<L>__{exterior underneath car night}
<A>__{max dives under a car and crawls for terror. he sees two sets of feet nun by. max starts to relax when he notices a pair of heels on the other side of the car. marcy bends down and looks at him.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{enough, max, c'mon out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{leave me alone. i don't know anything.}
<A>__{max retreats in the opposite direction. suddenly jake and brad grab him and drag him out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey! hey! hey!}
<A>__{they search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything. marcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. she walks over to max and shows max the front page of the wall street journal. it reads, "market craches"}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{you're responsible for this.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i didn't do anything. i didn't play the market.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{but we did.}
<A>__{marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. she opens it. it's max's stock pick that he threw out. part of the number is on the page}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{you have to be careful where you throw out your trash.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how could you do that?}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{you gave us faulty information. you gave us the carrot, the right picks, but then you only gave us part of the code.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you selfish, irresponsible cretins. how could you be so stupid!?}
<A>__{marcy jabs max in his stomach. max falls to the ground. the tough guys sit on him.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{c'mon, max. this isn't a game anymore. we're playing on a global scale. we used your code. foolish...i admit. but we can fix things if we make some careful picks. give us the rest of the code so we can set things right.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{c'mon! i know who you are. you're not gonna save the world.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{look, max...}
<A>__{marcy nods to jake, who pulls out a gun and points it at max's head.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{my god, what are you doing?}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{information is the private language of capital. we tried to establish a symbiotic relationship but if you choose to compete and enter our niche we are forced to comply with the laws of nature.}
<A>__{max thinks for a second. max thinks hard. he realizes be can't give them the number.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you can't kill me!}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{c'mon, max. you don't get it. i don't give a shit about you. i only care about what's in your fucking head. if you won't help us help yourself, then i will have only one choice. destroy the competition. i will take you out of the game. survival of the fittest, max. and we've got the gun.}
<A>__{jake cocks the gun. max starts to cry.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you bastards! you stupid bastards!}
<A>__{suddenly, jake is whacked with a sawed off baseball bat. he smashes into the sidewalk. it is farrouhk, max's neighbor, who's just pulled up in his taxicab.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(spotting his savior)}
<D>__{farrouhk!}
<A>__{farroukh threatens marcy and the other tough guy, who retreat in fear. farroubk is afraid as well, so he doesn't quite leap on them. he just keeps swinging the bat.}
<C>__{farrouhk}
<D>__{he's sick! he's sick!}
<A>__{max gets to his feet and runs behind farrouhk. just then a station wagon screeches up to the curb. lenny meyer, ephraim, and a bunch of other his burly jews jump out.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{max!}
<A>__{max looks at farrouhk and then he looks at lenny. ephraim grabs max and pulls him toward the station wagon.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to farrouhk)}
<D>__{c'mon...}
<A>__{farrouhk heads for his cab. ephraim helps max into the backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him. lenny meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray bearded yisrael slams on the gas pedal. farrouhk jumps into his cab.}
