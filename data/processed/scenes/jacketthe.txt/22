<A>__{from starks' p.o.v., we follow him walk down the hospital halls, even hazier from the medication than before. forms blur into one another and, on either side of him is a crazy world with crazy patients who've lost their way in it. starks reaches for the wall and runs his hand over it, trying to keep his balance. he's walking towards becker who stands at the end of the hall, talking to other patients.}
<D>__{starks [softly] i don't belong here. i don't...}
<A>__{starks falters but stays up. he turns to see a shell of an old man looking right through him with wooden eyes. starks' eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man's haunting sight that he doesn't see what's ahead of him. he bumps right into a hysterical patient whose sudden, earsplitting screams peal interminably through the air.}
<D>__{starks [mumbling] i'm sorry. i didn't mean... i'm sorry. i didn't mean it.}
<A>__{starks' fumbled efforts to help the patient only feed his hysteria more. the screaming is intolerable.}
<D>__{starks [forced to yell] will you listen to me? i'm not going to hurt you. please. i didn't mean to bump...i'm sorry.}
<A>__{orderlies and nurses, followed by dr. becker, surround them now, violently pulling starks off the patient. becker, familiar with the patient (harold), tries to calm him.}

<D>__{it's ok, harold. it's ok.}
<A>__{starks searches their blurred faces and stops on becker's as they restrain him and give him more drugs.}
<D>__{starks [to becker] i don't belong here... becker [angrily, to the orderlies] get him to his room.}
