<L>__{exterior chlodna street day}
<A>__{a stream of cars and trams. jewish policemen and german soldiers much in evidence. szpilman and henryk join a large crowd of jews waiting at a barrier to cross the intersection. the crowd is agitated, impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them through. a man next to szpilman and henryk is becoming more and more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot, taking off and putting on his hat.}
<C>__{the nervous man}
<D>__{this is totally insane; why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area? can't they go around?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{don't worry about it, they're about to build a bridge, haven't you heard?}
<C>__{the nervous man}
<D>__{a bridge, a schmidge, and the germans claim to be intelligent. you know what i think? i think they're totally stupid. i've got a family to feed and i spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through.}
<A>__{meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. jewish policemen and german soldiers are clearing a space, shoving jews out of the way, including szpilman, henryk and the nervous man. other soldiers are clearing a space. two german soldiers pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space.}
<C>__{the german soldier}
<D>__{dance!}
<A>__{the couple dance to the street band's waltz. at intervals, german soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. the german soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. one of them is almost hysterical with laughter.}
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{faster! go on, faster! dance!}
<A>__{the couples dance as fast as they can. a soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more.}
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{dance! dance!}
<A>__{then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions.}
