<A>__{samantha rubs curtis' shoulder, gently waking him.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{wake up babe.}
<A>__{curtis' head moves. he sees that samantha and hannah have removed their masks.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{where's your mask?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{we took them off. it's fine. take it off.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{curtis hesitates.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{we're fine. take it off.}
<A>__{curtis slips the mask off his face. worried, he takes a breath.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{you need to open the door now.}
<A>__{curtis doesn't move. he looks at them.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{what if it's...what if it's not over?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{what if it's not over?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{it's over. get the keys. open the door.}
<A>__{curtis slowly gets to his feet. he sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter. taking the lantern, he walks to it. samantha and hannah follow. curtis stops just inside. he holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors. he looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. he places his hand on the door. he flinches.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{it's still storming.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no. it's not.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i can hear it.}
<A>__{samantha stares at him. the room is silent.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{put your hand on the door. you can feel it.}
<A>__{he takes samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. he watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. she looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no". curtis kneels in front of hannah and mimics the signs from earlier.}
<C>__{curtis }
<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{thunder? do you feel it?}
<A>__{he flinches again. looks to the ceiling}
<C>__{curtis }
<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{you feel it? you feel it?}
<A>__{hannah walks to her mother. samantha holds onto her. curtis steps back from them. they watch him, their backs to the doors. he flinches and covers his mouth.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{baby, there's no storm outside.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{samantha walks over to him.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{curtis. i wouldn't lie to you. we love you very much. please open the door.}
<A>__{curtis is on the verge of tears. he slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. he removes the keys. he holds them out to samantha.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't.}
<A>__{samantha looks at the keys, then at curtis. tears shake from his trembling face.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i love you, but if i open the door, then nothin's gonna change. you'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. please. this is what it means to stay with us. this is something you have to do.}
<A>__{he looks at hannah, then samantha. curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching. he wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath. curtis walks toward the doors. on the steps, he reaches up to the padlock. the keys shake in his fingers. he turns to samantha.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{could you move hannah back?}
<A>__{samantha picks hannah up in her arms and curtis watches them retreat to the rear wall. he goes back to the lock. he inserts the key. the padlock pops open. curtis removes it. he looks back at samantha, then flings open the doors.}
<B>__{sunlight.}
<A>__{it's blinding. curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes. he stares up at a crystal blue sky. samantha watches as curtis steps out of the shelter.}
