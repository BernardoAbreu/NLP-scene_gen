<L>__{1994.}
<A>__{at a station in the middle of the room, two unconscious bodies lie on narrow beds wearing form fitting skull caps made of polyurethane. each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes. each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system. the tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds. each of these components isn't much to look at on its own. but together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read:}
<B>__{virtual reality criminal investigation simulator}
<A>__{to be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed involving parker, john, and sid 6.7 took place within virtual reality, not the real world. dozens of small character modules, similar to today's nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main console. each of the modules bares a name and number, such as maitre d' 1.7 and sheila 3.2. there is no character version number greater than 4.0. until you see the module labelled sid 6.7. the simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11 seconds. a clock reads: 3:04:32 pm. four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station. one of the men wears an l. a. p. d. uniform. his name is william cox, 40s. his nameplate reads chief of police. one of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor. intently following the action on screen. studying it clinically. her name is dr. madison carter, late 30s. she is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence. she is one of the country's foremost authorities on criminal psychology. her concerns are empirical. her quest is knowledge. she has little in common with the other observers. the other man is frederick wallace, 5os, chairman ceo of letac. expensive suit. commanding, powerful. but not as commanding, or powerful, as elizabeth deane, 605, the presidentiallyappointed crime czars elizabeth deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to letac. as well as which prototypes will move on to production.}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(quietly to wallace)}
<D>__{what did cox pull him out early for?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{don't remind me.}
<A>__{lab assistants remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies. the acupuncture needles remain in the caps. you can now see the faces of the participants: parker and john. parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness. he looks very different than his virtual rendering: his hair is long and ragged. his face is unshaven. a scar across his cheek. a hoop earring in one ear. his outfit a filthy prison uniform. john's outfit matches parker's. physically, he looks as cleancut as his virtual rendering. except that he is convulsing. violently. his flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him. like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. it's ugly. frightening.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(barely conscious)}
<D>__{somebody.. .do something!}
<A>__{two paramedics burst through the doors and rush to john. the paramedics inject him. fibrillate him. repeatedly. the simulator's designer, daryl lindenmeyer, 40s, high strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the equipment protectively. he is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for john's life. john's body goes limp. his vital signs flat. the paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet. they begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(annoyed to wallace)}
<D>__{what the hell happened?}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(pointing to needles)}
<D>__{lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. if the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream. the experience becomes real.}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(annoyed, to lindenmeyer)}
<D>__{i was assured the problem was corrected.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{i did fix it.. i told you i did. i don't know why it happened again.}
<C>__{deane}
<D>__{again?!}
<C>__{cox}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.}
<C>__{deane}
<P>__{(coldly, to wallace)}
<D>__{why wasn't i told?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{black book dollars, black book operation. you pay me for results, not how for how i get you there.}
<C>__{cox}
<P>__{(to deane)}
<D>__{i will tell you one thing there is no way in hell we should allow any real officers to train in this damn thing.}
<C>__{deane}
<D>__{then about all i've spent $37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population.}
<A>__{after giving wallace a cold, hard stare namely at his hand stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond studded cufflinks, she exits. wallace follows after her quickly. you now notice that the chair dr. madison carter had occupied is now empty. she left a while ago. cox remains. lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child. there are several scratches, but no major damage. he looks relieved.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(struggling to sit up)}
<D>__{he...only had a year left on his sentence.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{how much do you think i care?}
<A>__{parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at lindenmeyer.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer }
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{don't touch me!...don't touch me!!!}
<A>__{he flails his arms wildly. nearly spasming. this is clearly a man who should never drink coffee. two armed guards, who've been standing in the background, pull parker off lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground. lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put parker in handcuffs and leg chains.}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{i will walk him out.}
<A>__{the guards back off as cox helps parker to his feet.}
<C>__{cox }
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(still clearing his head)}
<D>__{why'd.. .you pull me out?}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{donley started experiencing the attack for real. if i hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you may not believe this, parker,}
<A>__{but i still consider us friends. he helps parker toward the exit as he continues having difficulty with his balance.}
<B>__{outside letac}
<A>__{the building is heavily guarded. razor wire, land mines, armed sentries. nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere near here. cox leads parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport. the two guards walk behind at a distance. two more by the transport. the chain between parker's legs keeps his steps short.}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he was a computer program for crissake.}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{you were supposed to act as if everything was real.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{real, my ass. it's an overblown game.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.}
<P>__{(eyeing parker's scar)}
<D>__{new scar you making it okay in there?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(head down)}
<D>__{i'm getting by.}
<A>__{he starts walking ahead of cox. distancing himself.}
<C>__{cox}
<P>__{(pausing for emphasis) )}
<D>__{you've got to know i tried keeping you out of general population. goddam politicians...}
<A>__{his voice trails off as parker turns around, and heads directly toward him.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(locking eyes)}
<D>__{you want to know how i'm doing? every day, i lose a little bit more of myself.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm becoming something else, and it scares the hell out of me.}
<A>__{he turns back toward the transport. cox follows. two armed guards open the back doors for parker, then stand poised with weapons out and ready. inside the prison transport rear cold metal benches. no windows. parker climbs in, the only passenger. he looks out the open doors to cox.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(half heartedly)}
<D>__{but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig, i've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{don't give up, parker. not ever.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{what about them?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do me a favor keep sending them.}
<B>__{outside letac}
<A>__{standing outside the transport, cox puts his hand on parker's shoulder.}
<C>__{cox}
<D>__{take care, pal.}
<A>__{behind him, john's body is loaded into an ambulance. the guards slam the prison transport doors shut. inside the prison transport rear parker sits in darkness as the transport begins its trek. the only light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel mesh, through which the guards can keep an eye on him.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(tauntingly)}
<D>__{hey parker i'm real sorry john boy got fried. what do you think big red's gonna do when he finds out you came back without his girl friend?}
<A>__{parker sits in silence.}
