<L>__{exterior holbrook house back yard later that day}
<A>__{aibileen has come along to aid yule may with elizabeth's baby shower. a table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and hilly's best sliver. hilly's son sits on her lap. the other girls' children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools. yule may clears cake plates while aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper. mae mobley wanders up to the table. her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's one piece.}
<C>__{mae mobley}
<D>__{mae mo hungry, momma.}
<A>__{elizabeth turns to mae mobley but never gets up.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{she's always hungry.}
<A>__{all the women laugh except for skeeter.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{you know she can hear you, elizabeth?}
<A>__{elizabeth looks down to her plate. aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to mae mobley.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{i'm on cut you some cake, baby.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{aibileen, we gave that scraper to hilly and william for their wedding present. chantilly!}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{it so pretty.}
<A>__{hilly begins bouncing william jr. on her knee.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at elizabeth's?}
<A>__{hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at skeeter's red satchel.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{nice to have your own, isn't it?}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{separate but equal. that's what ross barnett says, and you can't argue with the governor.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{not in mississippi. birthplace of modern day government.}
<A>__{hilly narrows her eyes at skeeter and turns to aibileen.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{aibileen, did you know that me and mister holbrook arranged for that bathroom? sent the boys over and the equipment, too.}
<A>__{hilly stays on aibileen, waiting for her to say something. skeeter fumes, hoping aibileen doesn't say it.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{yes, ma'am...and i thank you.}
<A>__{hilly smiles and nods.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{well...you. are. welcome.}
<A>__{hilly shoots skeeter a last look. william jr. leans into hilly and hugs her.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{one thing i got to say about miss hilly, she love her children. always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss.}
<A>__{hilly kisses her son gently.}
<D>__{aibileen (v.o.) (cont'd) and, law, do they love her back. when she starts up on me, i just try and think a my sweet treelore and how much he loved me. that kind a love makes me cry. even when it going to miss hilly.}
<A>__{hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of the jim crow laws sticking out.}
