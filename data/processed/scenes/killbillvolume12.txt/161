<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{hello manny.}
<A>__{she fires...then moves further into the house. apparently, this is the do the unexpected part of her plan. fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes across, send bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head for parts unknown. so far, so good. she enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds bill's cook and housekeeper, josephina. josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.}

<B>__{ready to fire... when...}
<A>__{ex cu the bride's eyes blink once. ex cu her finger comes off the trigger. what the bride sees in front of her is, bill in a tuxedo, holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her. standing next to him is five year old little b.b., dressed up in a very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding a orange squirt gun, aimed at the bride. the three look at each other for a moment, then bill says;}
