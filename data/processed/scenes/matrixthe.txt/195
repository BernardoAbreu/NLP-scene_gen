<A>__{neo tries to get up. agent smith jumps down onto the tracks and drop kicks him in the face. the world begins to shake, rumbling as the train nears.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{do you hear that, mr. anderson?}
<A>__{agent smith grabs neo in a choke hold, forcing him to look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in the darkness.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{that is the sound of inevitability.}
<A>__{neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{it is the sound of your death.}
<A>__{there is another metal screech, much louder, closer, as agent smith tightens his hold. neo is unable to breathe.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. anderson.}
<A>__{the train roars at them, swallowing agent smith's words. the veins bulge in neo's head, as he grits through the pain. he is not ready to die.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{my name is neo.}
