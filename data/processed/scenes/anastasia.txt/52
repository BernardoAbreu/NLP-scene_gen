<A>__{the volume of rasputin's voice rattles bartok around the inside of the glass. rasputin focuses on the reliquary.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<P>__{(to reliquary)}
<D>__{where is she? where is princess anastasia...}
<A>__{inside the reliquary the awoke begins to mow suddenly, the smoke explodes in a burst and forms into the smoke from a train engine. as the reliquary picture broadens, we see a train and anya, dmitri and vladimir all hurrying to catch it.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{she has friends. no matter...}
<A>__{bartok looks desperate under glass. he trios to topple the glass prism by jumping up but just cooks his head.}

<A>__{smoke begins to pour out of the reliquary. asput almost giddy with the thought of finishing ambition, laughs hysterically.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{ew, i hate when he does this!}
<A>__{as rasputin swirls his arms the smoke begins to form into minions. all look human at first, but then we see minion one, has the body of a human and a head of a jackal, minion two has the face of a woman and the claws of a tiger, and minion the most horrible of all has a huge bear like body with the head of a vulture. all wear long capes with hoods.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{she is not to get off that train... alive!}
<A>__{rasputin kicks open the wagon door and leaps outside. the minions, still filling out into forms, follow. one of the wisps of smoke, like a tail, swishes by and knocks over bartok's glass prism, freeing his.}
