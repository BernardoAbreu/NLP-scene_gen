<L>__{interior andy's house bedroom night}
<A>__{trailer music. joan is asleep on the bed. lying beside her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer. across the dark room, a trailer of blood and kisses plays on the tv screen. the scantily clad woman previously seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily stalking camera. her eyes widen in the familiar expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth to scream: joan flinches and sits up. she turns the tv off, which descends into a wooden console. at that moment, there is a voice from outside the bedroom window:}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{hey, andy!}
<A>__{in the vicinity of the bedroom window, a man in work clothes can be seen pounding on the glass as he continues yelling:}
<C>__{butch }
<D>__{it's butch! get your ass in gear and say hello to your old drinking buddy!}
<A>__{she calls loudly out to him:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{andy's not here!}
<A>__{he moves to the glass facade and peers inside, looking for the source of the voice:}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well, who are you, honey?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{she's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so...}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{whyn't you come out and say hello?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{will you please go away!?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{come on, stick your head out the door an' let's see what you look like.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but if you don't leave, i'm going to call the foothill patrol.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well, fuck you, honey.}
<A>__{he cups a hand over his crotch and, sticking his tongue out, flicks it in an obscene manner across his lips.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{tch, where does she find these people.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i was just trying to be nice.}
<P>__{(moving backwards}
<D>__{to the flower}
<P>__{bed)}
<D>__{go ahead an' call 'em, bitch, i don't give a shit.}
<A>__{he leans down, picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed and throws it toward the window:}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i will just come back and kick your ass in for you.}
