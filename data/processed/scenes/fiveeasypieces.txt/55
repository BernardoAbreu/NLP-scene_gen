<L>__{interior recording studio day}
<A>__{bobby enters the studio and comes toward her, opening his arms. she rushes into his embrace, burying her face in his shoulder.}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(very emotional)}
<D>__{oh my goodness... bobby...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{hi, tita.}
<A>__{she raises her head to look at him, and verging on tears:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{robert eroica...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{now don't...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{no, i'm not...}
<P>__{(taking a deep breath, then:)}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's good.}
<B>__{a new angle}
<A>__{tita sits on the piano bench, crying and searching through her purse for a tissue. bobby hovers behind her, gently patting her on the back and glancing with some embarrassment toward the recording booth.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i just can't look at you.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{don't, then.}
<A>__{as she blows her nose into the tissue, a young man comes into view, hands bobby a paper cup and leaves. tita takes another tissue from her purse and dabs at her eyes.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{you always do this to me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i don't mean to.}
<P>__{(setting the cup down on the piano)}
<D>__{here's your tea, tita.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{thank you...}
<P>__{(then:)}
<D>__{oh no, don't put it on there...}
<A>__{she quickly picks up the cup and places it on the floor.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(caressing the piano)}
<D>__{this is a very special, very old cb 275...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{you know who it once belonged to?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{waldnit von schnechter. prewar.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<A>__{he sits down on the bench beside her...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{it has absolutely no objectionable idiosyncrasies...}
<A>__{... and tests it out with a brief flourish on the keys. she watches him, then:}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{robert...}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(stops playing)}
<D>__{very nice.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i have to talk seriously with you...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{everybody still up on the island?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{well, herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just daddy, carl and myself... and van oost.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who's van oost?}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(not fond of the subject)}
<D>__{catherine she's a pianist. she's working with carl.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{carl's a fiddler. what's he doing coaching piano?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in la roche... and he ran into a jeep and sprained his neck...}
<A>__{bobby laughs.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sprained his neck?}
<A>__{tita laughs, then:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{it's not funny. he permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{crashes into a jeep and totals his neck.}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{that's carl...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{robert, i have to tell you something...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{daddy's very ill.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh, well, what, what's he...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{he's had two strokes.}
<A>__{he looks away from her, not wanting to hear any more.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{he's not... they feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{don't tell me about this...}
<A>__{he moves away from the piano and tita turns to look at him.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{but don't you think it's right, though, that you should see him, at least once...}
<C>__{second engineer's voice}
<P>__{(miked)}
<D>__{we're ready miss dupea.}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(to the booth)}
<D>__{just a minute, please!}
<P>__{(to bobby)}
<D>__{robert, don't you think it's right that you should see him?}
<A>__{he moves aimlessly about trying to subdue his anguish.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah... i guess so...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i'm going back up tonight. will you go with me?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{he glances at her, catching her profound disappointment.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into canada after... and i can't stay long, tita, probably a week, at the most.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{he looks toward the booth.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(then, to tita)}
<D>__{i better let you...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{she gets up from the bench and goes to him, taking hold of his arm.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{i will walk out with you...}
<A>__{as they move to the hall door, she addresses the booth:}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{i will be back in two minutes!}
<C>__{second engineer's voice}
<D>__{cut that in half, will you?}
<A>__{she smiles at bobby as they go out into hall.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{they hate me, i feel.}
<B>__{following with them}
<A>__{down the hallway.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{maybe you better stay, then.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{no, i need to talk to you, about so many things...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i will be seeing you in a couple of days, won't i?}
<A>__{they stop at the stairway.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh god, i'm so glad, robert, that you're coming...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, me, too...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{it'll be so good for you, and for daddy, because you know, you've never really...}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{tita, i've got to go...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{he kisses her.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{feeling herself about to break down again, she attempts a valiant smile and stands watching as... ... bobby turns and goes down the stairs.}
