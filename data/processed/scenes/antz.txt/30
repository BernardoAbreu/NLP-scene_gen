<L>__{exterior bike path day}
<A>__{long shot. a glimmering desert landscape (think of "the sun's anvil" in lawrence of arabia). two small figures can be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness. they're bala and z, who are crossing a concrete path in the park, which they perceive to be a "desert".}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{water...water...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{water...water oh, you already said that.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(walking along)}
<D>__{my skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...i wish i'd never met you, you ruined my life. zi ruined your life? look, i was perfectly happy until i met you alright, i was miserable, but i washappily miserable.}
<A>__{over z's line, we can see a gigantic wheel, getting larger and larger and heading right towards them, a gigantic wheel (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them).}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{bala pushes z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous crunching, grinding noise like a gigantic millwheel.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{we're going to die!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{come on it's gone! what are the chances of that happening again?}
<A>__{no sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well i will be.}
<A>__{bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{why didn't i listen to my mother ...why'd i have to go looking for trouble? any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{want a list?}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{wait, i hear something!}
<A>__{we can, in fact, hear a low, musical plunk.. there's a pause and then we can hear it again... z and bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the path). beyond, the grass starts up again. they have come to the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path) through the blades of grass, we can see...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{it's...it's...}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{water!!!}
