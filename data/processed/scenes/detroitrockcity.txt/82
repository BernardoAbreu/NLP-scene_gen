<L>__{exterior loading dock night}
<A>__{lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to huge trunks, keeping well hidden. he dodges roadies and avoids being seen by other guards. he slithers along side the 18 wheeler and nears the loading bay. up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.}
<C>__{security guard's voice}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{lex spins. the security guard, flanked by two others, barrel right for him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he dives rolls under the 18 wheeler. the three security guards leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.}
<B>__{on the other side of the semi}
<A>__{the three guards scramble to their feet and grab a scrawny body. they spin him around roughly.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{alright, wiseguy, you are so outta here!}
<A>__{they suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. it's a roadie.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{hey, what the fuck?}
<A>__{the roadie holds up his all access laminate angrily.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb fuckin' apes.}
<A>__{the security guards look around frantically for lex as other roadies join in to defend their comrade.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{where'd he go? you see him?}
<A>__{no one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the guards and up the loading dock ramp. they don't notice lex crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master. praying he won't be spotted, lex holds his breath as he's carried into the building and disappears.}
<D>__{jam in a jam kiss this}
