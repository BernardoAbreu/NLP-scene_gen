<L>__{exterior pensione ferrovia day}
<A>__{a small pensione across the street from the station. carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.}
<L>__{interior pensione bedroom day}
<A>__{later, carla, in silhouette, from behind. wrapped in a sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room. the light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. they whisper.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{close the curtains, it's too light in here.}
<A>__{carla closes the curtains. they continue to whisper.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{perfect. now, go into the corridor }
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{shhh! yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and i'm a complete stranger }
<A>__{carla sits on the bed facing guido.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i love your games!}
<A>__{she kisses him.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i'm here on business.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{go, go. wait. your face.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{get your makeup.}
<A>__{guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up. he begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes. he is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i had a nightmare last night. we were in that little alley behind piazza navona, where i bought you that scarf, remember? the same one your wife bought you }
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(probably doesn't)}
<D>__{don't move, carla.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{when you wear it, i never know if it's hers or mine.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(not really listening)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{so we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel! poor luigi!}
<C>__{carla }
<D>__{he would never do that! he's so sweet. he speaks latin! he knows all the roman emperors.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(still intent on his makeup job)}
<D>__{good for him.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{perhaps there's a job for him in the movie }
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you could work well together.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{beautiful. when you come in i want you to be my little savage.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(gesturing towards the door)}
<D>__{go, go.}
<A>__{guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table..}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you think i am one of your actresses?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{hurry, please, carla.}
<A>__{carla gets up and takes guido's glasses with her. guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for the game. carla looks at herself in the mirror.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{oh, madonna!}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i will pretend to be asleep.}
<A>__{carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on guido's glasses and turns back to him.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what if i really found the wrong room? would you be jealous?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{could you do such a thing?}
<A>__{carla teases him with a look that says, "why not?"}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{hm! who knows?}
<A>__{carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her. we hear the matron who runs the pensione talking to her. while they talk, guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer. now carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for guido to keep quiet.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(still giggling)}
<D>__{it was the woman from the hotel. she wanted to give me towels.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{come here.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you are a stranger, i don't know you.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{carla, just come here.}
<P>__{(indicating her sheet)}
<D>__{be savage. show me.}
<A>__{she crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{excuse me! i've got the wrong room.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{yes, you have. and i don't have the faintest idea who you are.}
<A>__{she throws herself on guido, whose arms enfold her.}
