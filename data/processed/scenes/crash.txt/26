<L>__{exterior first crash site day}
<A>__{james steps from the car, his right knee giving way after the effort of driving. at his feet lies a litter of dead leaves, cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety glass crystals. a hundred yards behind them, a dusty old lincoln is also parked on the verge. the leather jacketed driver watches james through his mudspattered windshield, broad shoulders hunched against the door pillar. as james crosses the road the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers at james through the eye piece. spotting the man, renata opens the car door for james.}
