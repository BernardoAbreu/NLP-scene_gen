<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing his full length mirror. he's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and the other hand clutching a half empty bottle of scotch. he observes himself and slowly turns around we can now see him in profile. his hair is disheveled, he's unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater. he's pregnant. he takes a big swig of scotch. the doorbell rings. jack walks away from the mirror. he staggers dead drunk. but dignified, pregnant. jack opens the door. standing there is graton holding a stuffed animal, a rabbit.}

<D>__{i'm the one who was tailing you... remember, in the park...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, yeah, the park... the diaper and all...}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{that's it, the diaper... but don't worry. this isn't an investigation, i left the force four months ago, and anyway, they've arrested the whole gang since then... i just wanted to ask you something...}
