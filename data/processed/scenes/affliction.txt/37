<A>__{an open cab grader ("our business is going in the hole") sits in the rutted lot outside toby's, a beer joint with fake wood siding and 24 hour neon sign. a four wheel drive plow with the lariviere motto pulls in, parks beside the blue grader. jimmy dame, 40, gets out, glances at the grader as he enters.}
