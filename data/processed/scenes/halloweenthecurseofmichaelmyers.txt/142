<L>__{exterior harvest fair night}
<A>__{tim and beth ride high atop the ferris wheel. their smiling faces aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of lights. dark clouds are gathering in the sky, covering the moon and stars. a light rain begins to fall.}
<B>__{angle on tommy}
<A>__{walking, searching, hunting. past a large tent where children are gathering. a sign reads: costume pageant. tommy reacts to a terrified scream. just a couple of teenage boys pulling an innocuously fightened girl onto another ride.}
<B>__{the stranger}
<A>__{walks steadily past the bright lights of the ferris wheel.}
<B>__{tommy}
<A>__{pushes through a dense crowd. suddenly he bumps shoulders with the stranger. more people pass. there was something very sinister about that man. tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror. tommy's p.o.v. stranger's wrist branded with the mark of thorn!}
<B>__{tommy}
<A>__{removes his gun. flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith. people see the gun in his hand and back away. tommy surges forward. the stranger walks faster. gaining ground. toward the halloween tree. workers hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack o' lanterns cross his path. tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him. the stranger is getting away! tommy picks himself up, raises the gun and begins firing shots into the air. people scream, scattering like insects, ducking for cover.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{stop that man! stop him!!!}
<A>__{tommy races through the horrified crowd. the stranger keeps moving, never once looking back. suddenly sirens. squad cars converge. sheriff holdt and a slew of officers surround tommy. weapons trained.}
<C>__{holdt}
<D>__{throw down the gun! now!!!}
<A>__{tommy drops the gun. puts his arms up in surrender. the cops swarm in, taking him.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{stop that man! he's the one!}
<B>__{angle on ferris wheel}
<A>__{beth and tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing lights of the police cruisers.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{who's gettin' busted?}
<A>__{beth is stunned to see tommy being searched spread eagle over the sheriff's car.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{jesus, that's my neighbor. tommy.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{kara and danny never showed up tonight. we'd better go home and check on them. there's nothing else for us to do here.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{but they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes }
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(suggestively)}
<D>__{we can light our own tree at home.}
<A>__{she brushes against tim's crotch and saunters away. tim glances back at tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.}
