<L>__{exterior red rock ridge pre dawn}
<A>__{jeep and charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the long climb up the ridge. charlie looks up. stars completely fill the pre dawn sky. breathtaking.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how can this happen?}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how can this happen in a world so beautiful?}
<A>__{jeep follows her gaze to the sky. endless stars. confounding. jeep shifts his eyes to the top of the ridge just ahead.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{c'mon, we're almost there.}
<A>__{they are only a few steps from the edge of the ridge when gabriel rockets up in front of them! charlie screams! jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. the crash has done some serious damage. much of his skin has burned away. chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a nightmarish creature. gabriel charges at jeep fast. jeep whips up his glock, blam! gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of jeep's hand. jeep throws a wild punch, connects with gabriel's chin, rocking him back. more annoyed than surprised, gabriel knocks jeep savagely to the ground. jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at gabriel swinging. but gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt. raises his fists. this kid will simply not give up. jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{so brave. so pointless. you should have worried more about saving yourself.}
<A>__{jeep's feet dangle. his eyes bulge out. he claws at gabriel's iron fast grip, but there's no hope. charlie watches in horror.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stop! please! don't kill him!}
<A>__{but gabriel is doing just that. jeep is rapidly losing consciousness. the battle is lost.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{go to sleep...}
<A>__{jeep's eyes flutter. he's almost gone.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stop it! i will give you the baby!}
<A>__{this gets gabriel's attention. charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't want this responsibility!}
<A>__{tears run down her face. she's dead fucking serious. gabriel lets go of jeep. he falls to the ground, gasping desperately for air.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{charlie, no!}
<A>__{gabriel takes the bundle from charlie, turning away from her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{"and as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world."}
<A>__{he peels the cloth back, revealing...}
<B>__{the grenade.}
<A>__{he spins around to face charlie. she's holding the pin. kaboom!}
<B>__{gabriel is blown to bloody bits.}
<A>__{the creature is gone at last. the sound of a baby cooing. charlie picks the child up out of the brush. she helps jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge.}
