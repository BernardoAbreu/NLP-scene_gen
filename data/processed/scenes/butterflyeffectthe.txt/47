<L>__{interior multiplex theater night}
<A>__{the movie's in progress. evan and kayleigh sit behind tommy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{holy shit! look at that fat fuck! you'd have to wipe his ass with a forklift!}
<A>__{some crowd members turn around and give tommy a shush. tommy whips m&ms at them.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{shut up, faggot. no one's talking to you!}
<A>__{kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out. evan follows.}
<L>__{interior lobby continuous}
<A>__{evan follows her to a small alcove.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm sorry kayleigh. this was a bad idea.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{you really don't remember anything that happened?}
<A>__{evan shakes his head "no". she looks devastated.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{you're so lucky.}
<A>__{she begins to cry. evan makes sure no one's staring.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's going to be okay. lenny'll be fine. you'll see.}
<A>__{he reaches to comfort her. but she winces.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{ouch.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{it's not your fault. mrs. kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{damn. your dad did this?}
<A>__{kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{i deserve a lot worse.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what are you talking about? what you deserve is a better brother and father. all they do is make you feel like shit.}
<A>__{she looks into his eyes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you?}
<A>__{she searches his eyes for sincerity. and finds it. they lean into each other for a tender kiss. after a moment, a roar from nearby.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing??}
<A>__{they jerk back to see tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd. by now, some teens chuckle at tommy.}
<C>__{teen punk }
<D>__{buying popcorn, what the fuck are you doing?}
<A>__{tommy rushes through the small crowd at evan. his hands in fists. suddenly a foot reaches out and trips tommy. tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him. tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with evan. hatred oozing. evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking. tommy suddenly lunges at the teen punk who must be at least a foot taller than he is. tommy lands a flurry of punches before the teen punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball evan. evan, kayleigh and even the punk's friends look on helplessly when two security guards seize tommy. tommy valiantly struggles against them at first. but the moment he realizes it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack. as tommy is being dragged away, he turns to evan, a sick smile on his face. evan and kayleigh look back, speechless.}
