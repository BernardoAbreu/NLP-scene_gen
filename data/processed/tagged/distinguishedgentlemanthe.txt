<B>__{begin titles.}
<A>__{camera very slowly pulls back. the sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of carats. we see the stone, then the ring, then suddenly, in b.g., something huge sweeps by. reveal a mechanical claw above the ring, hanging from a crane. the ring sits in a sea of tiny dolls, joke eyeballs, and other carnival junk. the claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it accompanied by oohs and aahs (o.s.) of hope and disap pointment. intercut : with the hands of a young black man working the controls. the eyes of a young black woman watching him work. another guy's hands digging in his pocket for change. quarters going into the slot.}

<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{well, y'know ernie... these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so called special interests. but, heck, i think you and fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today. i'm in congress to represent you. i don't want any so called reform to take that power away from you.}

<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{oh, i keep my ear to the ground, that's what a good politician does. listen, tommy, why don't we just get olaf's take on this.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{it's tragic, cancer's a terrible thing, but there's no way you can link it to power lines. truth is, there's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a microwave oven, than by those derricks.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but there are studies that say }
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{for every study that says one thing, i will show you a study saying another. we've studied it ourselves. nada.}

<A>__{as tommy persists, andersen looks increasingly angry.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{people didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. what if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?}
<C>__{andersen}

<A>__{andersen backs off, regains his composure. the outburst makes an impression on tommy.}
<D>__{tommy i'm just saying, it's worth looking into.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{tommy do you want to move the power lines? do you know how much it would cost to bury them? millions. tens of millions. i don't have that money. the state doesn't have that money. you people up here sure don't have that money. you know who'd end up paying for it? folks who sent you here, that's who.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{now how'd you like the people in your district to think of you as the putz who tripled their electric bill? you think they'd thank you for that on election day?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{all i'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at }
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{think for a minute, boychik. you hold your hearings. overnight, everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet. you kill the real estate market.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{you kill the insurance companies.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{you kill the school district.}

<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, the system ain't perfect, but the fleas come with the dawg.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{oh, by the way, tommy, on a completely different subject you don't have a state pac yet, do you? i'd like to give you a hundred thousand dollar corporate contribution to start one up.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{my company would be honored to do the same.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{can you do that? i thought there were limits }
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{oh, it's all aboveboard, we all believe deeply in the rules. it's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{are you interested?}
<C>__{tj}
