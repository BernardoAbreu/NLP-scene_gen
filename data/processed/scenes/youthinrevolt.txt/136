<L>__{interior girl's bathroom night}
<A>__{there is the clap of thunder outside as nick throws open the door to the girls' bathroom. he looks around with murderous rage. there comes the sound of someone vomiting. nick kicks in the stall and finds bernice lynch, 17, a thin platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. she hurls into the toilet again and turns around to find nick.}
