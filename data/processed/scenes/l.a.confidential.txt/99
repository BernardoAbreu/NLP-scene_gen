<A>__{the monied johns watch horny as hell as "ginger rogers" twirls around the room with a female "fred astaire." clothes fly as they spin. still, most eyes turn to lynn bracken as she enters oozing that cat girl grace.}
<L>__{exterior police headquarters day}
<A>__{reporters scribble as the chief speaks. uniforms everywhere along with exley and loew. bus sits in the back.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{edmund j. exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the l.a.p.d. recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty. it is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the medal of valor.}

<C>__{exley}

<A>__{exley considers his medal. it is an appealing thing. in the back, bud stays sprawled in his seat. no one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel. as the song ends...}
