<L>__{exterior greenwich street late night}
<A>__{tyler and aidan stand with the girls from aidan's photo opportunity. all are thoroughly intoxicated. there is a knot of club goers halfway down the block, drinking and having a fine time.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{i love this street. i love this city. where are you guys from, again?}
<C>__{aidan's girl}
<D>__{miami.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{miami. miami, barcelona, rio. new york is it, man. god broke the mold when he made this city.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you ever actually been to any of those places?}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<A>__{there's a gust of wind. aidan's girl shivers. she's wearing a tiny dress.}
<C>__{aidan's girl}
<D>__{what are we doing? i'm freezing.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{shoulda worn a jacket. like me.}
<A>__{o s we hear: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into the night...}
<D>__{voice o s michael...mi i chael!}
<A>__{tyler turns towards the sound. it's as if he's trying to spot a train in the distance. his hand goes to his pocket and fishes out his pack of cigarettes.}
<C>__{aidan's girl}
<P>__{(to aidan)}
<D>__{asshole.}
<A>__{she walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.}
<C>__{aidan's girl}
<D>__{are you coming?}
<A>__{tyler's girl looks at tyler, who is still preoccupied.}
<C>__{tyler's girl}
<P>__{(to her friend)}
<D>__{hold on, lauren.}
<A>__{the girls step away. tyler's girl appears to be trying to convince her friend to stay. aidan watches them, hopefully. tyler isn't watching them. he's watching two cool looking musicians, crossing the street with the light, carrying sound}
<B>__{equipment.}
<A>__{a quartet of neanderthals pulls up at the light in front of them in a car, aggressive music playing. the neanderthal at the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them. musician #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just wants to get across the street. the neanderthal revs and lurches again. musician #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.}
<D>__{musician #2 what's your problem?}
<C>__{neanderthal driver}
<D>__{my problem? keep your hands off my car, asshole. musician #2 blow it out your ass, guido. musician #1 go back to long island.}
<A>__{the car's four doors open, and the neanderthals lope to the front of the car. the driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side.}
<C>__{neanderthal driver}
<D>__{i'm from queens, faggot}
<A>__{a neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat. tyler watches as the neanderthals overpower them. the altercation has turned into a full on assault. the musicians are getting stomped into the pavement.}
<C>__{tyler's girl}
<D>__{so we were thinking we could go...}
<A>__{tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.}
<C>__{aidan}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{god damn it.}
<A>__{aidan runs off after tyler. tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing the beefiest neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the guy's face. he fights like a pit bull. not feeling, not stopping. aidan gets punched in the face. tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched aidan and it spurts blood. then someone hits tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin. the musicians get back to their feet and fight back. it's a brawl. aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself. a neanderthal swings at aidan and misses, grazing the girl. she jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact. tyler head butts the guy.}
