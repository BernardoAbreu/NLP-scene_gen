<L>__{interior suite, peninsula hotel late night}
<A>__{glass doors open wide to a terrace which overlooks kowloon, the harbor, hong kong island beyond. more lights than stars in heaven. and speaking of heaven... ...the sounds of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm, part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us}
<B>__{pan to...}
<A>__{...lovemaking in silhouette. this is the lovemaking of tigers, mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and somehow... ...tender enough. to suggest real love. later...mac and gin sit before the open terrace. there is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them. she has her pack drawn near. and qiu's leather pouch. she removes the goggles... this is the moment.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{in the hong kong and shanghai bank building. is a room with two computers. one for you. and one for me.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{glad i have a function, here.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the room is a vault on the 14th floor. access codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass words on the hour, but ...}
<A>__{but. she is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.}
<D>__{gin four men in the world . don't need codes. their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of these is china's minister of finance.}
<A>__{she lifts the goggles...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and his retinal plate is in there.}
<A>__{yep.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{our trade for the great train robbery. all right, let's say we're in the door. now what?}
<A>__{from her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle. opens it to reveal a shiny metallic disc.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{hong kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks. in hundreds of separate accounts...}
<A>__{holds up the metallic disc.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{this cd rom is programmed to send, instantaneously, thousands of instruc tions, with all necessary confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts....}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{modest.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{two or three million at a crack, in odd numbers. total, eight billion. and change.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and you've set up a laundry.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches, austria, uruguay, antigua, the channel islands, the caymans...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{seychelles?}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i left that out.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you're forgiven.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{thank you. as soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else, til the mafia couldn't find it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{but those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars. they're recorded in the main computer.}
<A>__{she waggles the disc.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{nope. the cd instructs the computer to erase the real transactions. and replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded xj6. little homage to limeyland, there.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{dearest. the accounts won't reconcile.}
<A>__{she waggles the disc. again.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{wrong. the cd instructs the computer to over report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we've lifted. so the chinese think the money's still there.}
<A>__{on this one. he has to smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the money. is still. missing.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some money. but they think hong kong knows it, too. and since we're leaving plenty in every account...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the shit doesn't splatter. until the first account runs dry.}
<A>__{exactly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and then . comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing!}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i was hoping there'd be one.}
<A>__{he settles back. looks at her.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{admit it, so far you're blown away.}
<A>__{well...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.}
<A>__{and his fingers reach out...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{pity it will be over. in 21 hours.}
<A>__{touch her hair. her face. she swallows. a raw moment. a hoarse...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{bet you say that. to all the one night stands.}
<A>__{but he's just staring in her eyes. the look pins her. she can't wriggle off. a murmured...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no, ma'am...}
<A>__{he leans to her...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{only the best of them.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
