<A>__{initial shooting script}
<B>__{begin main title sequence.}
<A>__{at the very edge of hearing, the tone of human voices. unintelligible, babbling, eerie. then a loud flapping sound. it shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something moving among the wall hangings. as the title appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the voices, agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior housing project, charlestown, massachusetts day}
<A>__{on a housing project in the industrial outskirts of boston. the banging seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up. and there, the source of the sound a sheet, snapping in the wind. the umbrella like clothes line on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to get in. through the glass door a woman paces inside, agitated. the voices rise over the banging, becoming intelligible }
<L>__{interior living room, nell's apartment day}
<A>__{ becoming a fight. jane, 30s, dark haired, furious, wheels across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it'll take a month to probate the will, nell! a month! even if mother left you something, you won't get it in time to pay the rent. so instead of complaining, you should be thanking lou for getting you these two weeks to get mother's things packed.}
<A>__{at first we can't even see who she's yelling at. at first we don't even notice her. then we do... holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain, like a part of the faded room is eleanor vance, 20's nell. she stares at the door. the clothes line raps at the begrimed glass.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{nell?}
<A>__{the wind dies, the banging stops. nell seems to hear jane and peers over at her, then across the room to jane's bored husband, lou. he's turning a franklin mint commemorative coin set in his hands, studying it.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{you're still going to have to settle with your mother's landlord on the back rent.}
<A>__{nell watches jane's little boy, richie. unpacified by the cartoons on the tv, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through neat rows of delicate porcelain dolls.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm not going to stay. i will get a job. i will get my own apartment.}
<A>__{richie knocks a porcelain doll off, and it breaks all over the carpet. his parents don't notice. but nell feels it in the soul. richie stops. a long beat. he looks at her, insolent, then plows on with his tank.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{nell. a job? two months and where is this job? you have no degree, you've never worked }
<A>__{nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ i've never worked? }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you have no experience in the world... the regular world. what would you put on a resume?}
<P>__{(beat, softening)}
<D>__{now we all appreciate what you did for mother. isn't that right, lou?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{eleven years. long time.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{that's why we've been talking. with me getting more time in accessories, and lou at the shop all day, we need somebody to take care of richie, do a little cleaning and cooking. and in return you can have the extra room.}
<A>__{she goes to lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her generosity. all nell can do is stare. and then: knock knock. like a shot nell is out of the chair and turning for a set of french doors across the room. it's all reflex. nell catches herself. knock knock. richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on the wall with a wooden cane and squeals:}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{eleanor, help me! i've got to pee!}
<A>__{nell reacts, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of trauma flickers over her face. the reaction is so strong we instantly know something is very wrong.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{richie, knock it off before i beat the crap out of you!}
<A>__{nell turns away, sick, breathing hard. jane picks up a jewelry box from a dresser.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you're sure this is all of mother's jewelry? the lawyer said to make sure we took it to him...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he said there might be some antique pieces. have you seen anything? some of it might be valuable.}
<A>__{nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry. jane no longer can bear the weight of nell's stare, checks her watch. she nods at lou. lou rises, pocketing the coin set. richie follows him out.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{think about our offer, nell. you don't know how hard it is out there.}
<L>__{interior nell's kitchen day}
<A>__{nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty. and then bursts into tears. shaking, she digs in her back pocket and pulls out a fine filigree necklace. her mother's. it's from an age gone by. clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.}
<L>__{interior living room, nell's apartment day}
<A>__{nell crosses the living room straight for the closed french doors, the glass obscured by gauze curtains. she throws them open and enters }
<L>__{interior sick room day (continuous)}
<A>__{ what once was a dining room. transformed into a sick room. drawn shades. dim. the first traces of dust. nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted. a perfectly made bed. the pillow, however retains the impression of a head. lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a cane. on the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet. i.v. stand. shrouded white shapes. on the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: a place for everything, everything in its place. a bit of wisdom. a way to live a life. a way nell has lived for too long. seeing it galvanizes her into movement. she goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it, removes a bottle of tylenol with codeine and marches out.}
<L>__{interior living room, nell's apartment day}
<A>__{nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales. she has been holding her breath.}
<L>__{interior nell's kitchen day}
<A>__{nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and tylenol in front of her. the necklace dangles from her fingers. she stares, mesmerized by it. then she undoes the hasp. the clothes line outside batters louder and, defiant, nell puts the necklace on. she closes her eyes. silence. the battering has stopped. a beat. and then the phone rings. nell opens her eyes. the phone rings. keeps ringing. nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hello? yes, this is eleanor. where? yes, it's right here.}
<A>__{nell listens for a long moment. she picks up the classifieds, flips through. and there it is:}
<D>__{trouble sleeping?}
<A>__{wanted research subjects. $900.00 .week + rm.&bd. @ beautiful}
<B>__{old house in berkshires. psychology study. end main title sequence}
<L>__{interior psych observation lab day}
<A>__{the lab feels more like the video center of a security office than a psychologist's laboratory. two banks of black and white monitors give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, wired to electrodes. they are taking psychological tests, although we never see the testers. the subjects are working through variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests. there are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors. on the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no discernible sequence. the subjects on the left are better able to concentrate on their tasks. the subjects on the right keep stopping, and going over what they have done. two men,}
<B>__{malcolm keogh}
<A>__{, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the head of the department; someone we trust. he faces}
<B>__{professor james marrow}
<A>__{. he is a man whose confidence rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two is the power that makes him the teacher students love. right now, though, he is defending himself before a department review. this is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free form. the men are having a fight, and they are watched by other}
<B>__{professors.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's still an electric shock!}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{come on malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! and it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...}
<A>__{malcolm looks at the monitor. this is marrow's chance to explain it again.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{look, look at what it does! the subjects on the left, because they anticipate the shocks, make the adjustment, and lose nothing on their scores. the subjects on the right, because the shocks are random, can't anticipate, and the distraction throws them off.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{stop defending your science after the fact, jim. the department protocol for research is very clear about this, and you violated the rules. i know, i know, i know that "fear and performance" is a big sexy idea, but as long as i'm chairman here you will need this department's endorsement to publish it, and right now i can't do that.}
<A>__{at this moment,}
<B>__{mary lambretta}
<A>__{, late 20's, marrow's pretty t.a., opens the door with an armload of files. whatever else she's wearing, she wears glasses. marrow, seeing her, motions for her to go away. he doesn't break eye contact with malcolm. mary hesitates...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{malcolm, this is essential work i'm doing. just think what my research can do for education. elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{and that will be a good place to end this study.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no, malcolm! individual performance is only part of it. i know why baseball players choke for no reason, i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what i want to know is, how fear works in a group...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{but if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. the deception is minor.}
<A>__{malcolm sees mary lambretta.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you working with her?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{mary, i will meet you outside.}
<A>__{she understands, and she closes the door.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{why are you working with her? mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a ph.d. in psychic studies.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{and after she was thrown out, she needed a job.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you don't believe in the paranormal.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no, but she does, and that's all that matters.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{does she know that's why you're using her?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i, i just can't...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{she needed a job, malcolm. and she's smart. and she helps me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i have a bad feeling about what you're doing.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{this is the last chapter. please, please give me clearance. it's for science.}
<A>__{marrow waits.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm gonna hate myself for this.}
<A>__{but he nods. permission granted.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{thank you.}
<L>__{interior hallway outside lab day}
<A>__{they open the door. they walk out. mary is there. she closes her eyes, and does a gypsy voice.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i see a hostile man... he's (she describes him). the hostile man does not believe in madame velka.}
<A>__{this relieves the pressure. malcolm is not listening anymore and storms off.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you know what he's really upset about?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you're going to publish, he's going to perish... and why did you hire me for this?}
<A>__{marrow has a sly smile. they go into his office through another door in the lab.}
<L>__{interior marrow's office day}
<A>__{long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with computer. as soon as they enter, mary looks at the phone.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's for you.}
<A>__{and then the phone rings. he doesn't pick it right up, he lets it ring.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{you hear the vibrations in the wire. there's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. i could test it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{test it.}
<A>__{the phone still rings. marrow answers.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{yes, this is doctor marrow.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how'd i know it was for you?}
<C>__{marrow}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{because it's my phone.}
<P>__{(back to the phone)}
<D>__{yes... mrs. dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. see you soon. thank you.}
<A>__{he hangs up. marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk. mary shows him a huge corkboard covered with photos, articles, and various items.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{here's how they're organized. groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for. and they all score high on the insomnia charts.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{a photo of nell falls on the floor. marrow scoops it up. he holds the photo of nell up to mary, and look at the written notes and studies the graphs that go with it.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{this is correct?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{her mother died two months ago. she says she really wants to do this. i didn't know if it'd be taking advantage...}
<A>__{marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks at the graph of her test scores.}
<C>__{marrow}
<P>__{(meaning the graph, not the face)}
<D>__{what a beautiful profile. how do you feel about her? what does your}
<A>__{intuition say? mary balks at his teasing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i put my favorites on the top.}
<A>__{marrow continues to study the files.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{okay... this one's good... extrovert feeler... okay... this one i like, too...}
<A>__{we don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other images on the wall. we find clinical looking shots from stanley milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to electrical shock. rows of weeping prisoners in the stanford prison experiment. photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the aftermath of a riot. a picture of the fuhrer before his mesmerized masses. mary opens a large envelope. she takes out a photograph that we can't see.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's this?}
<P>__{(has to get his attention)}
<D>__{what's this... this picture?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{that? that's hill house.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this is where we're going?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{yes. it's perfect, isn't it?}
<A>__{mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him. in her glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{nell, in a rust wormed old buick, glances from the road to computer drawn directions to hill house. she hums a tune, soft, lonely, like a lullaby but eerie, off key.}
<L>__{exterior route 39 day}
<A>__{the car speeds down the country road, past old stone walls, out into rolling meadow, its winding route taking it across the western berkshires, farther and farther into the glorious hills.}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{countryside speeds by. she passes an antique store in a barn. a handpainted sign warns melby's apple farm 100 yards. nell grabs for the window handle, letting in air. she snorts, smelling, breathing like it was the first time in her life... sounding like a pig. and it makes her burst out in embarrassing, animal laughter.}
<L>__{exterior hillsdale day (establishing)}
<A>__{the white steepled church, five stores and gas station of hillsdale lie in a forgotten notch in the hills.}
<L>__{exterior gas station day}
<A>__{nell is pumping gas at a country station. she is alone at the pump. as she finishes, she hears a baby crying. she looks up. she is immediately drawn by the sound. she moves to a car at another pump. the car is empty. the windows are rolled up. she peers into the car, through the window, and sees a toddler in a car seat. the child is crying. nell looks around, no one is there. she makes faces at the baby, coos to it.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hello baby...}
<A>__{she does a peek a boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby even starts to giggle. a voice from behind.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{what's going on, what happened?}
<A>__{nell turns. the mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with stuff from the gas station's market.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{she's okay. she woke up and she saw she was alone.}
<A>__{the mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{say thank you, spencer.}
<P>__{(too much of an explanation)}
<D>__{i was getting her something to drink. she's been crying all day...}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{of course you know, how many children do you have?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{then you're a teacher. nursery school.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you just... you seem like someone who takes care of children, lots of children.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{maybe... maybe someday. i'd like that.}
<A>__{the woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car. when she does, we see a friendly gas station attendant appear behind nell.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{umm, i'm a little lost.}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{they sent me directions and i've got a map, but it's kind of confusing. here... it's a place called hill house?}
<A>__{his helpful attitude changes dramatically.}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{hill house.}
<A>__{he takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{you don't want to go there.}
<A>__{he turns abruptly and walks away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{did i say something wrong to you?}
<A>__{nell slams the buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine. she gets control, and puts the car in gear. she's shaken. badly.}
<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{nell's buick bounces over a country road. the car works its way up into the steep, switchbacking hills.}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{nell looks out at the forest, feels a chill. the road is more like a tunnel through the forest than a road.}
<L>__{exterior hills day}
<A>__{nell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and higher into the awesome solitude.}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{nell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right catches her eye, then is gone in the trees. she watches again for it. there. a glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back twenty yards from the road. there it is again. moss greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it. and then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of immense stone pillars. between them, a steel gate as high as the wall, chained and padlocked.}
<L>__{exterior hill house gate day}
<A>__{the gate stands immense. silent. forbidding. beyond them a gravel drive curves away through the trees. nell kills her car, gets out, instructions in hand. no one in sight. a long beat. she reaches in and blows the horn. the horn shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate, echoing. silence. nell blows the horn a sustained staccato in annoyance. the echo replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound. nell covers her ears. silence once again. in a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it. it's locked good. she turns and there is a man right behind her. it is}
<B>__{mr. dudley}
<A>__{, his hair tied back like an ex hippie. he stands between nell and her open car door, weed spear in hand. he smiles at her rough, dirty, massive.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{oh! you scared me.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{me? no. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{are you mister dudley, the caretaker?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{yeah, i'm mister dudley, the caretaker. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm with dr. marrow's group. i'm supposed to check in with mrs. dudley up at the house. is she here?}
<A>__{she hands him the directions. he glances at them. she uses the distraction to get into her car.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{maybe she is...}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{nell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no return. mr. dudley eases over to her window. mr. dudley gives her one last look and goes to the gate. he produces a keyring and undoes the padlock.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why do you need a chain like that?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{that's a good question. what is it about fences? sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable. why would that be?}
<A>__{he unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn. the gates swing in, revealing hill house.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{is there something about the house?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{mrs. dudley'll be waiting for you.}
<A>__{grinning, dudley steps aside and nell rolls through. and at that he just grins wider. nell pulls away. disturbed, she watches him in the rearview mirror. she turns and in front of her sprawls hill house. at center, the features of the oldest part of the house dwarf all others: towering, eye like windows and the jaws of a grand entry with carved ebony doors.}
<L>__{exterior hill house driveway day}
<A>__{the car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.}
<L>__{interior nell's car day}
<A>__{nell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the carport. in the silence all we can hear is her breathing.}
<L>__{exterior hill house day}
<A>__{her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone. its brake lights go off. the finger like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning the car in place under the house's gaze. nell gets out of the car. nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the house. a romance in its lilac heavy gothic decay. nell feels it, is drawn to it.}
<L>__{exterior grand entry day}
<A>__{nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors. on closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a garden of eden. at center on the knocker, a tarnished silver adam takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart eve. nell lifts adam and knocks heavily. there is no answer. nell looks around for some sign of life. off to one side is a ladder and paint cans. somebody must've been touching up the window trim. when she looks back the door is ajar a fraction of an inch.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hello? hello? mrs. dudley? mrs. dudley, are you here? anybody?}
<A>__{tentative, she pushes it open into }
<L>__{interior grand entry day (continuous)}
<A>__{ a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far above. rays of light filter through floor to ceiling curtains. doors lead off in a half dozen directions. every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion. it overwhelms the eye.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{wow...}
<A>__{she turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor. a short hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly lit. and then nell hears a sound. carrying through the empty halls from some distant place: a low, plaintive moan. nell freezes. the moaning stops. nell strains her ears. and then the moan again. it comes from the short hallway ahead. nell starts for it. the moan stops.}
<L>__{interior hall from entry to great hall day}
<A>__{nell moves down the hall. it's dim, stale, lined with pier tables, candelabra.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hello? hello? mrs. dudley?}
<A>__{her voice echoes from the room beyond. she follows her own voice into }
<L>__{interior great hall day (continuous)}
<A>__{ a long, oval great hall. passages and doors lead off in all directions to god knows where. a double grand staircase at the far end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the next floor. magnificent animal heads carved on the newel posts glare at her. nell makes her way past clusters of furniture, stops at the center. silence. an enormous fireplace dominates one wall. large enough to stand in. an iron mesh screen hangs in its mouth. mantle and chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows above. the moaning sound. nell spins away from the fireplace. the sound rises from the door at the very back of the hall. nell takes a step toward it.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{mrs. dudley?}
<A>__{she moves up to the door, puts a hand out to it. the moaning rises. nell pushes through }
<L>__{interior 1st floor hallway towards kitchen day (continuous)}
<A>__{ into a much narrower, curving hallway. doors all along it. the sound comes from the door right there across from the one nell just came through. she flings it open }
<L>__{interior kitchen day (continuous)}
<A>__{ and comes through into a vast kitchen. a woman in black with her back to nell stands at a counter. the moaning comes from a disreputable old can opener. nell breaths, feels stupid. the woman senses her, turns from her cans of potatoes. she is}
<B>__{mrs. dudley}
<A>__{, sallow, unsmiling.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{it's make the soup or answer the door. can't do both.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{mrs. dudley.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{so far.}
<A>__{mrs. dudley wipes her hands, regards nell, nods.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm eleanor vance, i'm with }
<C>__{mrs. dudley}
<D>__{ dr. marrow's group. you're the first.}
<A>__{mrs. dudley just stares with her sunken face. it unsettles nell.}
<C>__{mrs. dudley }
<D>__{i will show you your room.}
<L>__{interior grand stairway mezzanine day}
<A>__{mrs. dudley glides up the stairs. nell follows, hoisting her suitcase after her. it appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a hallway. but as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an enormous oil painting. in it stands a man, his features lost in the shadows above, only his body visible. the nameplate reads hugh crain.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hugh crain.}

<D>__{finally.}
<A>__{she backs away from the window, spins around and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of hugh crain. it is the painting. it is only from up here on the second floor with this curtain open that the face is visible in the late day sunlight. despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness. unconsciously, nell takes a step back. in the far b.g., near the end of one of the halls, a door stands open, the second or third set of doors in the gothic hallway left of the painting. just as it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it swings silently shut. but nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the harp is out of tune.}
<A>__{she finds a key and begins tightening the strings as marrow bangs open the door, briefcase in one hand, cell phone in the other. he can't conceal his irritation. marrow removes folders from his briefcase, passes them around while she plays. nell again studies the cherub of death on the spine of the leather bound books.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i will have to count david watts as a no show. so let's start. thank you, mary.}
<A>__{that was a little abrupt, she feels it. everybody finds a chair or spot on the sofa. mary remains on the stool by the harp. marrow sits in a large winged back chair.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{all right? so, to answer your earlier question, todd, why are we here? what do we all need in life, what are the basics? we need food, we need water, we need sleep. sleep. all of you resist it? why? what does that mean? why do we resist sleep? my field of study is the individual's psychology of emotion and performance.}

<D>__{so why did you need the addam's family mansion for a scientific test?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and i wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. you'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.}

<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{there was once a king who built a palace. the king's name was hugh crain. a hundred and thirty years ago, when the merrimack valley was the center of american industry, hugh crain made two hundred million dollars. that's forty three billion dollars in today's money. he could have anything he wanted. and what he wanted, was rene, his banker's beautiful daughter. rene, and a house filled with children.}

<A>__{nell's face flushes with compassion. with longing. marrow looks at her. he's vulnerable. needing. she doesn't dare hope. the moment lasts a few heartbeats. he looks away. a flicker of distress crosses nell's face. and then she realizes marrow is looking at luke.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{you have to see something.}
<L>__{interior grand stairway day}
<A>__{luke, nell and marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up. they find theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting. she turns and looks at nell strangely. nell, confused, turns around. on the wall and the painting are dark stains. black. blue. runny. almost like something leaking from the roof has run down. nell steps back. the stains are the letters n and o. pulling back farther: the rest of the word eleanor.}

<C>__{nell }
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{but the substance doesn't come from the ceiling. it is as if the oils on the painting of hugh crain have been boiled by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there. hugh's face is gone. in place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas glares out... like a skull. nell screams and runs away, the others calling out after her in alarm. as they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and we discover smeared paint on the floor. smeared, it seems, with little footprints in it.}

<A>__{nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second floor. the air stirs her hair. she peers up at the house's roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like so many screaming heads. chilled, she pulls her sweater closer. marrow comes out onto the balcony from twin french doors behind her.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{are you coming to confess?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i wish i were. i wish i had done it, then i could confess and you'd be at peace. that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved, i wish you had an enemy, so i could beat him up.}

<L>__{interior greenhouse day}
<A>__{marrow lets nell into a long, victorian era greenhouse. it's overgrown, lush, the leaded glass panes above stained with years of condensation and pollen. vines and trees climb up the sides. beds of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick. nell leans down to look into a water garden with a statue of a man bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been drowning. a sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse. and a cavalcade of water comes out of the statue's mouth surprising nell. she lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with marrow. nell loves the greenhouse. it takes her breath away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{oh... it's so beautiful...}
<A>__{nell makes her way among the plants. she looks up at a towering, double helix staircase which rises from the floor to a platform which gives access to the roof. below the staircase are planters filled with violets.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{violets. somebody must've died here.}
<A>__{and then, out of the corners, comes mister dudley.}

<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{you're smiling.}
<A>__{marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in hand, lifts it to her face. while she talks, she walks, and marrow follows.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i was just thinking how happy i am right now. all my life, i've been waiting for an adventure. and i thought, oh, i will never have that, adventures are for people who travel long distances, that's for soldiers, that's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with. and here i am, and something is happening to me. strange noises in the night. paintings are calling to me. and all it cost to get there was five gallons of gas. i'm getting my adventure.}
<A>__{for the first time since we've seen nell, there is something to her which is simply... erotic. marrow follows her down one of the footpaths. she smiles back at marrow as he trails her. she reaches a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the slightest sway to her gait. marrow follows her around the corner into the transept. at the far end the wall is completely overgrown. nell looks up through the ceiling at hill house looming grim outside, distorted in the old glass.}
<C>__{marrow}

<A>__{nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, passionate woman. she walks away, the sway in her gait aching, powerful. marrow is surprised by what nell just said and stares at her as she comes to the overgrown end. nell reaches out to the hanging vines, pulls them aside... ...and a face stares out. gastly. white. nell takes an involuntary step back, a little gasp. the face is marble. blind eyes stare from stained cheeks. it is a statue of crain. marrow comes over. it's an enormous stone tableaux of hugh surrounded by cherubim. the plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence from the greenhouse.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{hugh crain. can't seem to get away from him.}
<A>__{she laughs a little at herself. marrow joins in. he helps her pull the plants back to reveal more of it. she reaches out, touches the marble cheek. then daring, grins, and begins to hum her tune. marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow dance with hugh crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing marrow.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what is that tune?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't know. a lullaby i guess. my mother used to hum it to me. and her mother before that, and so on.}
<P>__{(to the statue)}
<D>__{hugh crain, would you care to dance?}
<A>__{she hums another two notes, and bang! the door behind her slams open in a gust of wind, jolting nell. she stops and stares. outside the window, through the glass, she sees mr. dudley, staring at her, he's been watching her dance. the spell is broken. nell, embarrassed, can't bear to look at him. a beat, and then marrow goes over and shuts the door. when he turns back nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps echoing in the vaulted room.}
<L>__{exterior rear lawn day}
<A>__{nell hurries away from the house, across the rear lawn, ashamed at herself as much as she is spooked. in the distance mr. dudley is walking toward the house with cans of paint cleaner an a ladder. nell stops, watching him. he senses her, pauses, and smiles. nell reacts. sees the ladder. then mr. dudley disappears into the house. nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of }
<L>__{exterior family cemetery day (continuous)}
<A>__{ the tiny crain family cemetery. nell catches herself. a small swinging gate bars the way. she hesitates. nine moss covered headstones show the wear of a long century. eight small headstones, one large one. a half dozen unmarked stones in the grass: stillbirths. nell is drawn into the graveyard. the large stone is rene crain's. the smaller ones are her children's. nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names. one reads adam crain april 5th 1874 ... the rest of the date is covered by growth. she clears it away. april 6th, 1874.}

<C>__{nell }
<D>__{suffer the little children unto me.}
<A>__{there are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a day. there's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a cherub of death. we've seen this image before. nell backs out of the cemetery, afraid.}

<L>__{interior crain's secret study day}
<A>__{down the circular stairs nell enters a very small dusty room. velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing through. as her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a late nineteenth century office, crain's secret office. the bookcases filled with business ledgers. the business ledgers are stamped with the cherub of death. at the end is an enormous desk. behind it a massive, carved chair covered with a sheet, only its lion head arm rests protruding from underneath. nell realizes it's:}

<D>__{crain's study.}
<A>__{she moves for the desk. an enormous mirror, its silver inner surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, and for a split second, a shadow in the chair. nell steps in front of it, blocking our view. and when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the chair, the natural shadow of the room. nell goes around the desk, stands over it. the chair sits silent behind her, shrouded. on the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names lowell, haverhill, manchester and years: 1884, '85 and so on. she flips one open. the ledger is a payroll account. names upon names of workers rendered in sepia by crain's severe cursive. notations in the column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate wage for each class of worker. many of them, at least a third, are children. nell reacts. disturbed by it. she shifts closer to that damn chair behind her. the sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone could be sitting there under it. she turns the page. columns indicate pay, and so on. but one column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is unlabeled. down the column, some names have a line drawn through them, and at the end of the line, a cross. nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger. she turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed column, more crosses. and more. her eyes flick back and forth. the crosses are paired with entries for child. she looks their names...}

<C>__{theo }
<D>__{nell...}
<A>__{nell stares at her, hair tangled, tear stained, doubtful. water splashes in the tub, faucets still running. the lights flicker as one in the connecting rooms. theo has time to look up at the bulb in the bathroom, and they all go out. darkness swallows them up. stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror silhouettes them standing there.}

<A>__{ theo's room. theo's form moves by her bed, and with a snick, her cigarette lighter lights up. theo holds it above her head, its tiny orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows. nell steps toward her. drip. drip. from the bathroom. theo's eyes widen?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{oh, god, your breath...}
<A>__{and sweeping over them a shock of cold. their breath. nell shakes her head: don't say anything. nell turns around, the darkness almost impenetrable. shapes, alien, threatening, at the very edge of light anyone could be some... thing. drip. drip.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{it's here.}
<A>__{nell looks down at theo's bed, then at theo who moves closer to nell. nell gives the bed a wide berth. together they back toward the wall with the fireplace. they stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid. behind them looms the fireplace and in front of it, a metal cage like fire screen. a beat. bam! something lunges out of the fireplace but is caught in the screen, hitting nell and theo in the back. theo's lighter goes flying in that very instant, and we never see what's hit the screen. neither do they. theo falls screaming. nell manages to whirl, embrace the cage and slam it with whatever's inside back into the fireplace. the screen jolts hard enough to lift nell.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{theo still screaming, lying on her back before the fireplace, rams her feet against it. the screen hammers at nell and theo. they can't run or it'll get out. theo's screaming is suddenly drowned out by a horrifying, inhuman sound from inside the fireplace. theo's scream goes dead in breath stealing horror. nell recovers.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{no! go away!}
<A>__{the screen punches out at them, denting. and then all the air in the room seems to be sucked into the fireplace in one thump. the door to the bathroom slams. it's gone. they sit there in the darkness, panting.}

<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{don't tell the professor; he'd probably throw me out. but test taking is one of the ways i've been supporting myself. i volunteer for every paid study that they offer. of course straight psych stuff doesn't pay as much as the pharmaceuticals do, or a good wound study. check it out.}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection. like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but i think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no. no... jim's not doing these things.}
<A>__{but there's a desperate, rising edge to nell's voice. theo's, in response, is quiet, sober... certain.}

<A>__{theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to someone out of her mind. nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the greenhouse... the one where crain's wife killed herself. and for a moment we see crain's wife hanging there and then the image is gone...}

<A>__{marrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but nell isn't hearing anything anymore. she dies inside. her world upside down. she falls into a chair, and all we can hear of marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his garbled jargon.}

<D>__{one minute!}
<A>__{it's marrow, for real, about to enter. nell clicks off the recorder, drops it into the briefcase. marrow is startled, not expecting nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase.}

<D>__{how can he think i'm doing this!}
<A>__{she has a floor lamp in her hands, and hurls it like a throwing hammer at the nearest shelves. vases, knickknacks and a leather album crash to the floor. she stalks around the room, and then slows, staring at what she's done, the rage draining out of her. but if she could do something like that...}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{no. no, i couldn't do those things: i'm not making it up.}
<A>__{she turns in place, desperate... and sees the old leather album precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves. it's open. one of the leaves flips over on its own, gravity and the weight of its own pages turning it. nell approaches, stepping over broken ceramic. slip. another page turns. nell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant. slip. another page turns. the book is a photo album of the late nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged daguerreotypes in pressed vellum frames. nell peers closer. it's open to a faded, gray image taken long before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, rene crain, sitting in a chair. and standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat, his face hollow, malevolent. hugh crain. nell shivers, and slip, the page turns on its own. an image of hugh and rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces. the page flips. crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on rene's face is the faintest, most inappropriate smile. it sends a chill through nell. the album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, pages flip, rene's smile grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit with grinning insanity... nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf. it is open in her hands to a picture of crain, alone, in front of the enormous fireplace in the great hall. rene is gone. the photo is monstrous. nell, fearful, turns the page and reacts to the last thing she expected. a picture of a lovely woman filled with grace and power. carolyn crain. posed. on a settee before the fireplace. beautiful beyond words. smiling. ahead of her time.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{his second wife. there was a second wife? carolyn.}
<A>__{it warms nell. she turns the page. now crain is there beside carolyn. but there is something different about him. less frightening. nell flips the page again, and now there is an image of crain and carolyn. her hair is up in a french twist. nell smiles more. nell turns the page yet again. but something is wrong . it is another image of carolyn and the kinder, gentler crain, but now it is carolyn who is unsmiling. another page. another. carolyn's face darkening. and in this picture, carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{she was pregnant.}
<A>__{nell turns pages faster and faster, and as she does, carolyn swells pregnant before our eyes in ragged animation, mouth working as if to speak, voiceless as it is... eleanor. nell fumbles the book onto the floor. it stares up at her, open to the last page. it is an image of carolyn. betrayal. hell. knowledge. her hand seems to be pointing at the gaping maw of the grand fireplace. nell bolts from the room.}
<L>__{interior great hall day}
<A>__{nell bursts into the great hall and stops. at the far end of the room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the veil to some hellish sanctuary. nell stares at it, daunted. what is it that carolyn is trying to show her? the fireplace beckons, and nell approaches against her will. she finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down. she uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open. she steps into its soot black mouth. nell peers up the chimney. a faint sigh of air. she sticks the poker up the flue, scratches around. nothing. she turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it. sooty stone chips away, but it's solid. the mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye. nell grabs the heavy, iron lever. she pulls, but can barely budge it. it finally screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace}
<B>__{swings down.}
<A>__{nell looks in. two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a charred timber or two sticking out. sick with fear, nell prods the ash. just charred wood. she thrusts the poker down deep. it vanishes in the ash up to her hand. clack. she rakes through the ash. clack. and then she feels the poker take purchase. she draws it out, and full of dread turns it to the light... impaled on its hooks are two human skulls. nell fights back the scream in her throat. one of the skulls is a child's skull, the other an immense skull with brooding brow, forehead crushed. nell lets the poker drop. it bangs off the door, falls in the ash drop, its handle hitting a spring. nell recoils as the trapdoors snap shut like a pair of jaws.}

<L>__{interior confusing series of rooms (the maze) night}
<A>__{nell winds through the pitch dark halls, rooms gaping black left and right, searching for the voices which seems to come from just around the next bend, leading her around corner after corner. the hallways peel past nell as she runs, slamming through doors, ever darker. the house's hellish carvings glare as she passes, grinning, taunting. she rages on, oblivious until she rounds a final corner }
<L>__{interior hallway outside locked room night}
<A>__{ into the long, dark hall leading to the locked room. the statuary peer down on her. dead faces. blind marble eyes. as she turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her. for a frame or two the eyes are real, just a subliminal glimmer. for the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't there. it makes nell stop. she regards the terrible doors. she considers the labyrinth around her. and begins to understand.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{the house... it's a maze, that's how you designed it, didn't you, mister crain? so wherever one of your little guests went, the house brought them here. it's designed to make you come here. but why?}
<A>__{another cry comes from the far end. nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a tide. she hesitates, but then the child cry forces her on. she reaches the carved doors with the wooden guard statues.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{oh, no... oh... no... no, no... not that... oh no... ohhhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{gaping cold and stench hit her. she gags. now the cry comes from under the door. present. real. right there. nell shudders. the cry grows louder, desperate. she shuts her ears to it. the cry rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore. not sounding like anything human at all, it's painful. nell looks at the locked room in horror and takes off running.}
<L>__{interior picture gallery dusk}
<A>__{nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops. standing there are marrow, theo and luke, stricken silent by her entry. looks of shock on their faces. nell just stands there. a beat. and then it pours out of her, hysterical.}

<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. mass hysteria is like a story, nell. a communal story. someone starts it. then we all add a little more to it. and then for some reason no one knows how we start believing it. this story shapes what we see and hear. we interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house. you've added to it. that's what this experiment has all been about. that's what it was about, the experiment's over. i'm pulling the plug. this is my fault.}

<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{why would we want to do that, nell?}
<C>__{nell}

<L>__{interior great hall night}
<A>__{nell, marrow and theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause. luke is halfway across the room, looking back to make sure they're with him and nell digs her heels in, jerking marrow and theo to a stop. she stares. the others follow her gaze. she's looking down the connecting hall, out to the entry at the front doors. they're open.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{in the night...}
<A>__{the door bams shut with a concussion that rocks the entire room, sweeping luke's jacket under it. the handles turn, lock down. stunned. all stunned. a rush of air. the house exhales. silence. and then creeeeak. they cast their eyes back up the stairs. bump bump. far off sounds, hair raising, of infinite variety, carry down the halls.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{...in the dark.}
<A>__{luke rushes from the room.}
<L>__{interior grand entry night}
<A>__{luke yells and throws himself at the front doors. marrow runs over to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and pries. marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back. luke joins him, and they shoulder block it together. but this door is massive. there's no way.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no you bastard! break!}
<A>__{he roundhouse kicks it, hurts himself. theo, afraid, watches the great hall behind them. nell puts her hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it's not safe for you anymore. the children need me, and crain is doing everything he can to keep me from them.}
<A>__{theo stares, appalled. marrow looks around, puts his hand up to shush everyone. the house moans, the bumping growing, searching.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he rushes down the hall, luke right beside him, nell and theo in their wake.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{luke's first barging into the kitchen. big windows all along the wall. huge windows. marrow follows him in, luke's fear turning into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows. nell and theo are right behind in time to see luke and marrow scooping up a table and chair respectively.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{watch out!}
<A>__{the men rush the same window, side by side, and let the heavy pieces of furniture fly from ten feet. the window shatters, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness beyond. but the metal lattice remains, the chair's legs stuck in it. marrow and luke pause, taken back a beat. they hustle over to it. theo and nell stand a few feet back. luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal. marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some sort of handle on the other side.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{theo watches the door behind them. luke pries at the inch of metal between him and freedom. it won't break.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{they don't open!}
<A>__{marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice lacerating his ring and little finger. with a cry of pain, he lands on the floor.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{oh jesus my hand.}
<A>__{nell and theo fall to the floor to help him. marrow moans, and nell grips his injured hand in hers. fast, like she was born a trauma doctor, nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{give me your shoelace.}
<A>__{marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at nell. she's calm. terrifyingly calm. and in that moment, he realizes she's not out of her mind. she just understands things beyond what he could possible begin to understand.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what'll happen to us, nell?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{nothing, if you leave right now. there's a war going on all around us. don't get in the way, please.}
<A>__{nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist. luke throws down the chair, giving up on the window.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{shit! all right, you sonofabitch...}
<A>__{as he looks up at another one of crain's painting hanging on the wall. nell theo with marrow straggle toward the great hall.}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{maybe this'll get your attention!}
<A>__{luke flicks a lighter out of his pocket.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{luke!}
<A>__{before anyone can stop him, he lights a towering tapestry on fire. he races from one to the next, lighting them. theo and nell help marrow up, back away as luke shoots by. all the tapestries are on fire, blazing up like torches. at last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the center of the room. they stare at him, appalled, afraid. knowing he has done something wrong. luke stops. maybe fifteen feet away. he sees their expressions.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{nell looks over at the burning tapestries. heat sears the stone, blackens the carved figures in the woodwork. the ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{we'll get out after this wing burns down. let's go.}
<A>__{but there's no need. the tapestries are consuming themselves too fast to ignite the walls or ceiling. they all realize it. as the last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is utter silence.}
<L>__{interior great hall night}
<A>__{luke looks at them helplessly. an awful, impending beat. without warning, the huge persian carpet he's standing on jerks out from under him. luke falls on his stomach. stunned, luke looks straight into nell's eyes. then the carpet slides fast for the fireplace. it whips up to the hearth and sends luke flying through the chain curtains. the others are speechless. they can do nothing but watch as luke lays there on the ashdrop. a long moment.}
<C>__{nell}
<P>__{(to the house, to crain)}
<D>__{no! no! let them go!}
<A>__{she knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it. luke stands up, has time to give her a look. and then the lion's head flue drops open behind him. luke looks back into its iron eyes and with shocking speed the flue snaps shut again, taking luke's head off his body. the decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet with its strings cut. nell, marrow and theo stand there. not sure of what just happened, their minds unable to accept it. a sound comes up in theo's throat. a sob. a horrified whimper. marrow and nell stand there speechless. it's as if saying the obvious will make it real:}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{luke.}
<A>__{bang. the blood splattered lion's head drops open. luke's head falls out. theo screams and screams again. nell backs away with marrow, almost has the presence of mind to drag them away, but clang! the ash drop opens. the sudden sound stops them in their tracks. as they watch, it's as if the house inhales. and boom! out of the ash drop explodes a hail of bones, skulls, flying ash. nell, theo and marrow back up toward the grand staircase as tons of incinerated human remains vomit from the fireplace, blasting across the floor, knocking over furniture with shocking violence. skulls bounce over wood. hundreds of them. theo and marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone, loose teeth pelt them. nell is immune. they run up the grand staircase toward the top and finally it can't reach them anymore.}
<L>__{interior mezzanine night}
<A>__{they look out at the full scope of crain's horror.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{oh god, we can't get out!}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell, what do we do?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{he played hide and seek with the children. that's how he built the house.}
<A>__{marrow stares at her, trembling. he glances around at the winding labyrinth of house. impossible.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{we can't hide in here! we won't make it til morning.}
<A>__{nell looks at him, pitying. infinitely sad, but guarding them.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{behind them the huge painting of hugh crain in a golden frame with sharp metal spikes, looks down at them. the room inhales and exhales, the bumping sound resumes. a rumble runs through the house and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud of ashes still hangs in the air. unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them. the sound from the great hall makes marrow and theo back up more, but nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and she will fight it... she suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches out for marrow and theo, pull them out of the way as the giant painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them. it misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes. marrow and theo are shocked as they back up right toward the griffin on top of the staircase. for a split second the brass griffin right behind them, comes alive, opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but nell sees the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{no, no, you leave them alone!}
<A>__{and the griffin turns back into brass. marrow and theo unaware of what happened behind them. they have to get out of there.}
<L>__{interior second floor hallway night}
<A>__{nell leads marrow and theo down the dark hallway, the twisted woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, trip someone, grab a sleeve. it is a nightmare house. doing what it was made for. the bumping they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the ceiling. it gives chase, on the floor above. nell keeps looking back, and every time she does the bumping seems to get more firm, more like a footstep. calm, nell urges them on.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hurry.}
<A>__{the footsteps upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving better, more naturally. theo and marrow turn left through an archway. nell looks back at the ceiling. the thing's moving fast. she dodges toward the archway where theo and marrow went, and stops. it's a wall. solid wall. there's no archway here! nell backs away. alone. the house has separated them. nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked. there's no other way then going back.}
<L>__{interior mezzanine day}
<A>__{nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over crain's painting. the long white lace curtains in front of a side window start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed! nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, calls out:}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{jim! theo!}
<A>__{no answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the curtain billows out behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a split second, the image of crain, grabbing for her. nell, oblivious, steps just out of reach, and as the breeze fails, the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into chaos. nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at the open window. she turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends and walks down the steps.}
<L>__{interior grand staircase great hall night}
<A>__{close on the brass griffins that guard the staircase. behind nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their eyes as nell enters the great hall. and they cower in fear for what is about to happen. again nell call's out for theo and marrow. and nell doesn't see the scores of tiny arms of children that fold out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as nell carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children that cover the floor. horrifyingly alive are these tiny hands as reach out for her hair after she passes. we're screaming as they almost have her... and nell steps away. and then... creak... creak... creak... the terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in fear. the lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly. cherubim, afraid, clasp hands. gods and men pay unwilling witness to what is now coming down the stairs. the upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the landing. the sound stops. nell's breath escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to the floor in the grand entry. darkness against darkness. something blocks the glint of the gilded frame up on the landing. something huge. a beat. and then a shadow sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down them. before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, flickers into existence: the shape, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders stooped. and just like that, all it is... ...is a well of darkness and night once again. we don't even know for sure what we just saw. but it is still there in that bar of shadow. nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful presence. she is spellbound. bang. a door in the connecting passage opens, and theo and marrow come out, between nell in the entry and the thing in the great hall beyond. in a flash the shape is moving at theo and marrow. they don't see it, have their backs turned.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell! there you }
<A>__{but nell is looking past them. they see her face and turn around.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{nooo, not them!}
<A>__{what is coming at them makes the blood stop. the shape rushes from the great hall, vanishing as it crosses the pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but visible in its effects: theo screams. marrow stumbles back. and then nell's voice rings out:}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{is this where she bashed your brains in?}
<A>__{the onrushing presence stops. seems to turn its attention to nell, standing there before the towering front doors.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{when you came in the door? i bet that was the last thing you expected. right? from}
<A>__{carolyn ?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you thought, oh, carolyn, i've taken it all out of her, you thought, oh, carolyn, she's no threat. carolyn. great grandma carolyn. did you know that?}
<A>__{nell shows no fear. there's a ferocious edge to her voice.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{she found out what you did, and she knew there was only one way to stop you. and she stopped you, so you couldn't torture anymore of the living.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you wouldn't even let go of the dead, would you? well, now i'm here. they called me. did you know that? they've been crying out for help for a long time. and i heard them.}
<A>__{she points out at the human remains strewn all over the great hall.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{and i won't let you hurt them anymore.}
<A>__{the shape hovers there, silent. air and shadow distort around it. the carved animal heads on the newell posts and walls loll back and forth, alive then not alive. pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{come on, hugh crain, you know what to do. we've both been here before.}
<A>__{the shape howls forward, knocking everyone out of their seats. it flies across the floor at nell. marrow and theo are slammed against the walls out of its way. nell opens wide her arms in an embrace. it's on her, but just as it seems to hit, it splits like she went right through it. the shape and all the debris in its wake impacts deep in the enormous doors. the carved woodwork seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning. and then all the screams are cut off. nell stands there with her arms spread. a long moment. she opens her eyes. and then the woodwork lashes out, grabs her from behind, slams her back against the doors. the blow has killed her. we feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork. and for a few seconds nell's body just hangs there... and then it gently falls down. theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward nell.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell!}
<A>__{marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his beliefs changed forever. he walks over to nell and feels her pulse, knowing it is a useless gesture as theo softly moans over nell. and as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new carving in the sculpted doors. it is a woman and as we move in we can see that she wears the same necklace as nell...}
