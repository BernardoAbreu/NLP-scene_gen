<A>__{maples smiling easily. like a guy telling the story in a bar.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, what then, sergeant?}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{what else? i had the boy teach me kendo. including...the importance of the bow.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. maples the loudest. hooks smiles like a regular joe.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and your evaluation of the defendant? could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? so quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{oh, in a heartbeat.}
<A>__{and the smiles are gone. all around.}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{able and willing. like few men i've ever seen.}
