<A>__{the boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the sounds of this country morning: the snorting of horses, clucking of hens, a command from the father as the man feeds the animals. the boy scratches, he pees. he sees his mother on the roof. she is a silhouette against the dawn, as she feeds cedar and yak chips into the incense burner sending white, curly smoke up, to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of printed mantras. we pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark. lhamo's house is the house in the vision.}
