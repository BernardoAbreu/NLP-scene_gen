<T>__{dissolve through to:}
<L>__{exterior top floor}
<A>__{with the last toll of the clock punctuating the cut, we are floating in towards the shattered board room window. the woman's scream on the street below is faint, echoing, mixing into the sound of an approaching siren. through the window we see the board members still sitting around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and disbelief. all stare at the shattered window in the f.g. at the far end of the table, hudsucker's chair is empty and oddly askew. his cigar still smokes in its ashtray. there are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table. one executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from his nose. we hear only the hum of the hudsucker clock. sid mussburger enters frame at the window. he is a tall middle aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a commanding presence. he knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in. the camera follows him into the room. the other board members' heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader. apparently, some absurd hope still lingers. mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair. he reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's ashtray.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{pity to waste a whole monte cristo.}
<A>__{the other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.}
<C>__{an executive}
<D>__{he could've opened the window.}
<C>__{elderly executive}
<D>__{waring hudsucker never did anything the easy way.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{my god, why?! why did he do it?! things were going so well!}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{what am i a headshrinker? maybe the man was unhappy.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{he didn't look unhappy!}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{yeah, well, he didn't look rich.}
<C>__{eldery executive}
<D>__{waring hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out.}
<P>__{(reminiscing)}
<D>__{he built this company with his bare hands. every step he took was a step up. except of course this last one.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but when the president, chairman of the board and holder of eighty seven percent of the company's stock drops forty four floors }
<C>__{precise executive}
<D>__{forty five }
<C>__{eldery executive}
<D>__{counting the mezzanine }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{ then the company has a problem. stillson, what exactly is the disposition of waring's stock?}
<C>__{stillson}
<D>__{well, as you know, hud left no will and had no family. the company bylaws are quite clear in that event. his entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{stillson}
<D>__{meaning simply that waring's stock, and control of the company, will be available to the public on january first.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{you mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly t shirt will be able to buy hudsucker stock?}
<A>__{stillson shrugs.}
<C>__{stillson}
<D>__{the company bylaws are quite clear.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{my god! you're animals! how can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty five floors }
<C>__{precise executive}
<D>__{forty four }
<C>__{elderly executive}
<D>__{ not counting the mezzanine.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{quit showboating, addison, the man is gone. the question now is whether we're going to let john q. public waltz in and buy 87 percent of our company. pipe smoking executive what're you suggesting, sidney? certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{not while the stock is this strong. how long before hud's paper hits the market?}
<C>__{stillson}
<D>__{january first.}
<C>__{an executive}
<D>__{thirty days.}
<C>__{another executive}
<D>__{four weeks.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{a month at the most.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{one month to make the blue chip investment of the century look like a round trip ticket on the titanic.}
<C>__{an executive}
<D>__{we play up the fact that hud is dead.}
<C>__{all}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{long live the hud!!}
<C>__{another executive}
<D>__{we depress the stock }
<C>__{yet another executive}
<D>__{ to the point where we can buy fifty percent.}
<C>__{precise executive}
<D>__{fifty one.}
<C>__{elderly executive}
<D>__{not counting the mezzanine.}
<C>__{cautious executive}
<D>__{it could work.}
<C>__{optimistic executive}
<D>__{it should work.}
<C>__{practical executive}
<D>__{it would work.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<P>__{(at ticker tape machine)}
<D>__{it's working already. waring hudsucker is abstract art on madison avenue. all we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders.}
<C>__{enthusiastic executive}
<D>__{yeah, a puppet!}
<C>__{another executive}
<D>__{a proxy!}
<C>__{yet another executive}
<D>__{a pawn!}
<A>__{mussburger strides across the room from the still chattering ticker tape machine and lowers himself into waring hudsucker's chair. he takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales a cloud of smoke.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{sure, sure. some jerk we can really push around.}
