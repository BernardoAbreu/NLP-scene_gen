<L>__{interior mine shaft day}
<A>__{rotten beams. chipped walls. a generator powers a string of lightbulbs. a lone figure works at the end of the tunnel. chris mccormick (30s) has rugged good looks. weathered clothing. dirt stained face. ripped muscles. chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. as it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up. chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet light. something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him. chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. he chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. reflections of silver and gold splash across his face. his smile fades...}

<A>__{chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. a large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away chris's sack lunch. chris grabs his pick axe and goes after the rat. the rodent dodges every hit. sparks fly when the axe strikes rock. these ignite a vent of methane gas. a brief explosion knocks chris off his feet. he notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove. chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch.}
