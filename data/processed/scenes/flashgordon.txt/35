<L>__{interior palace of halls series of dissolves}
<A>__{(armored man, aura, dale, flash, klytus, leader, ming, voices,}
<P>__{zarkov)}
<A>__{as flash, dale and zarkov are marched along by many armored men, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable dimension. we pass an archway opening into what seems to be an amuseme nt arcade. glimpse of mongo people playing amazing electronic games, while mongo go go girls cavort on a platform to unearthly music.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{fantastic into a black hole and out the other side to this. who said hans zarkov was mad?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you're mad.}
<A>__{look down over a balcony from a moving pov. a fencing glass is in session. six pairs of men go at each other with magic swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the blades clash. thrust, parry, slash! the head of one duellist explodes in a bloodless fountain of fire.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{you got us into this how do we get out?}
<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{get out? why? we're being taken to ming getting at him is our only hope of saving earth. it's perfect!}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{dr. zarkov, i'm about to show you what it feels like to be clipped by a new york giant }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{flash, it's no use he's too crazy!}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{step forward, soldier.}
<A>__{the designated one marches two paces forward, halts.}
<C>__{ming }
<D>__{are you loyal to ming? would you die for him?}
<C>__{armored man}
<D>__{gladly!}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{fall on your sword.}
<A>__{instantly the armored man pulls his sword, rips open his breast plate, sets the sword hilt down on the floor and plunges forward on to the fatal pointerior with a little cry of horror, dale shrinks back into flash's arms.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{you inhuman fiend!}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{of course i'm "inhuman"! that's a compliment!}
<P>__{(dropping his voice)}
<D>__{pathetic earthlings, forever wondering if you are alone in the universe beaming you plaintive messages into to the void for anything that might hear you even hurling your bodies out into it and all without the faintest inkling of who or what is out here. if you had known anything anything at all about the true nature of the universe, you would have hidden from it, in terror!}
<A>__{there is a low throaty laugh from the shadows. flash and dale turn their eyes quickly in its direction.}
<B>__{feature princess aura}
<A>__{emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the head of an obscure beast slouching between her legs. voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, aura looks flash boldly up and down as the beast hisses with the pleasure of her touch. flash can't take his eyes off her. no normal man could. flash swallows with a dry throat as aura's gaze devours him. dale gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and whispers}
<B>__{loudly.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{watch it, fella you came with me!}
<A>__{aura laughs again, sidles up toward ming. we dimly see a couple of mutant creatures dragging away the lifeless body of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{you know who ming is now who are you and why do you come to mongo?}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{i'm flash gordon of the new york giants this is dale arden dr.zarkov hijacked us in an effort to save earth.}
<A>__{ming looks questioningly at klytus}
<C>__{klytus}
<D>__{sirs, earth is the meaningless planet you are in the process of obliterating.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<P>__{(pouncing on that)}
<D>__{in the process? you mean earth still exists?}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{for the moment not for much longer.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{but why? what in hell have we ever done to hurt you?}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{you exist and yet you pay no homage to ming! what greater crime can be committed?}
<A>__{the palace rings with an answering chorus: voices of all the armored men and numerous others presently unseen, including many women.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{hail, ming! hail, great one without mercy!}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{come closer, dale arden let me see you.}
<A>__{dale doesn't move. ming takes a step down, narrows his eyes and gazes at her intensely. this guy's personal magnetism is enormous. as if irresistibly drawn, dale steps forward. ming moves his hand in a gesture. a sourceless golden light bathes dale, sensuous musical chords are heard. dale's lips open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing increases. ming touches her flesh lightly. flash tense, ready to spring.}
<C>__{klytus}
<D>__{this woman will amuse you.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{klytus can see the future, eh?}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{he can foresee it but for a few moments only. it gives him a unique gift for survival, and treachery.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{extraordinary. i'd like to study his beta factors i wager i could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise.}
<P>__{(peering at klytus)}
<D>__{tell me when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle? here?}
<A>__{ming flashes a glance of interest at zarkov, then addresses the leader of the armored men.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{chain this one up. preserve him for further examination.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{hail, ming!}
<A>__{zarkov is roughly seized. flash starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{oh no you don't! we came together and we're staying together!}
<A>__{languidly, ming indicates flash gordon with a pointed finger.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{that one is useless to us. remove him and kill him.}
<A>__{shock reactions. flash wheels back at ming as dale steps in front of her friend.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you dirty old bastard can kill me too!}
<A>__{close angle aura wetting her lips, moving sinuously to whisper to ming:}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{don't kill him yet, father. give him to me!}
<C>__{ming}
<P>__{(eyebrows up)}
<D>__{what would your prince barin say?}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{i can handle barin.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{really, aura your appetites are too monstrous even for our family. this could cause great trouble with barin i must forbid it.}
<A>__{aura touches the rime of ming's ear with her tongue as she}
