<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior inn kitchen med. shot (night)}
<A>__{we pan betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens.}
<C>__{bob's voice}
<D>__{tuna fish, on the lower shelf.}
<A>__{betty whirls around. med. shot betty and bob we see bob is having a snack of his own.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what are you doing? sleep walking?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{little young for that, aren't you?}
<A>__{he gets up and goes to the refrigerator. his preoccupation with the food will permit betty's expression to be more obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for bob, since their significance must escape him.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what shall i make you?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{anything'll do.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{if you tell me what you want to dream about i will know what to make you.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{different foods make for different dreams. i've got a whole theory about it. it's called "the wallace way of wishful wooing." you'll find it in the american medical journal under 'w'. ham and swiss cheese, for instance, you get a cool, thin, blonde girl. turkey sandwich, you get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy though. now a liverwurst sandwich }
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{you get both girls at once. bad night.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what do you dream on tuna?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{darndest thing, i dream about me.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{then i will have a tuna sandwich.}
<A>__{bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{now that's very flattering. tuna coming up.}
<P>__{(he is occupied at}
<D>__{the frigidaire while she watches him}
<P>__{yearningly)}
<D>__{let me make you some warm milk. that'll help the insomnia.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(meaningly)}
<D>__{no it won't.}
<P>__{(looking straight at his back)}
<D>__{warm milk won't do it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{whatever you've got on your mind isn't worth staying awake for.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i think it is.}
<A>__{he smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{would you like to know how i handle a situation like that...?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{tell me, doctor...}
<A>__{bob begins to sing count your blessings, as he prepares the warm milk and hands it to her. she drinks it down. as he reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the table, betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward bob. he takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between her head and her chair. she waits, eyes closed, expectantly. but bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door and exits, closing it softly behind him. after a moment, betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.}
