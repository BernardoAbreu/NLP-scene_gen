<L>__{exterior hillside home driveway night}
<A>__{cholo and foxy run up the road to the t bird. seeing a walker lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.}
<C>__{holo}
<D>__{i got it.}
<A>__{wfffft! cholo picks off the walker with his crossbow.}
<C>__{holo }
<D>__{come on, let's go.}
<A>__{he slaps a hand on foxy's back. xcept it's not foxy! it's another walker that has moved between the two men. it grabs the hand that slapped him and bites it.}
<C>__{holo}
<D>__{ahhh...fuck!}
<A>__{foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the walker. cholo is faster. with no time to reload, in agony, he pulls a fistful of arrows from his quiver and drives them through the walker's face and skull. the walker falls. so does an ominous silence.}
<C>__{holo }
<D>__{i can't fucking believe it. (a sad chuckle) nothin' works out. it's like...the world is spinning around and we're just...caught in the wind. nothin' works out. some damn thing always comes around the corner and gets you.}
