<L>__{interior exterior apartment day}
<A>__{betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself a cup of coffee. she takes the coffee outside to the courtyard to a white metal table just outside her doorway. she sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun. across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in one of the apartments. she drinks her coffee and listens to the music. some birds fly by overhead. she takes another sip of coffee. the blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in tempo and volume. the phone inside rings. betty takes her coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind her. she crosses to the leather couch and picks up the phone.}

<A>__{betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. she sits for a moment listening. silently she stands and moves toward the bedroom. as she approaches the bedroom door she stops at something she sees. rita is sitting on the edge of the bed crying quietly. betty goes into the bedroom. rita looks up at her with desperation.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{you're awake... i think i misunderstood you. i thought you knew my aunt and that's why you were here. i just talked to my aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police.}
<A>__{rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with her hands.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{rita?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(crying harder)}
<D>__{i'm... sorry. i ...}
<A>__{betty's heart softens.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what is it rita?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(still sobbing)}
<D>__{i'm...i'm... oh no... i thought when i woke up... i thought sleep would do it ...}
<A>__{betty kneels down in front of her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i don't know who i am.}
<C>__{betty}

<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i'm not. i don't know what my name is. i don't know who i am!!}
<A>__{betty looks down at the purse next to rita's dress. she picks it up and hands it to rita.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{this is your purse. your name must be in your purse.}
<A>__{rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. she hesitates. something is worrying her. she looks at betty for help.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{you want to know don't you?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i ... yes, but ... i ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{open it!}
<A>__{rita slowly unzips the purse. the pressure of its contents force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills. both rita and betty almost stop breathing. they look at each other, then back to the money. rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets it on the bed. she reaches back inside and comes up with the only other remaining item in the purse ... a blue key. betty sees rita's expression change to a kind of horror}
