<L>__{interior rick's police cruiser day}
<A>__{having escaped from town, cris and liz share a glimmer of relief.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you make it look easy.}
<A>__{cris' expression darkens.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{oh shit. oh no. liz what is it?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i blew it.}
<A>__{they round a curve and the narrow bridge comes into view.}
<B>__{far side of bridge}
<A>__{behind the barricade, ferris' helicopter comes in for a landing.}
<L>__{interior rick's police cruiser day}
<A>__{cris checks his rearview mirror. a six pack of cop cars are right behind him. to his left, a steep rock wall. to his right, a vertical drop off into the canyon. cris drives on, the blood draining from his face.}
<B>__{far side of the bridge}
<A>__{ferris strides across the span, baines in her wake. arriving at the barricade, she approaches the biggest state police car, a hummer and flashes her badge.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i need your vehicle.}
<A>__{she walks through the trooper and gets into his hummer.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{what's the plan?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{playing chicken.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{don't be stupid! he knows what you'll do!}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{but so do i. and for once, that makes us even.}
<A>__{she starts up the hummer. it roars.}
<B>__{the bridge}
<A>__{cris slams on the brakes. stops the car. police cars stop behind him, blocking retreat.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{get out! now! or you'll die!}
<A>__{she hustles out.}
<D>__{liz what's going to happen? cris we'll find out.}
<A>__{a quick look good bye and he drives on.}
<B>__{hummer}
<A>__{ferris gathers her determination and floors it.}
<B>__{on the bridge}
<A>__{a game of chicken with a difference.}
<B>__{on cris}
<A>__{squinting. cris' visions: fast forward to the head on collision! then a collage of alternate choices and outcomes: cris swerves; slams on the brakes; gets shot making a run for the rail; spins out on the roadbed; crashes over the side, over the side, over the side! but in every version, the hummer is unchanging. unrelenting. dead on. the bridge now they're speeding closer.}
<B>__{ferris}
<A>__{total focus. no doubts or decisions. cris' visions: fast, quick, condensed the falling car crashes onto the canyon wall, tumbles downhill, explodes; falls again, this time crashing directly onto boulders at the bottom...}
<B>__{on cris}
<A>__{he drives toward a specific segment of railing between two light posts.}
<B>__{the bridge}
<A>__{rick's cruiser crashes through the railing and plunges over the side of the bridge. liz runs to the rail and leans over the side, watching the cruiser fall down, down, down through the narrow ravine.}
<B>__{in the falling car}
<A>__{cris unbuckles his seat belt. opens the door. just before impact, he leaps out, away from the car.}
<B>__{bottom of canyon}
<A>__{the car smashes into boulders at the shallow side of the river. a moment later, cris splashes a few yards away in the deepest part of the rapids.}
<B>__{on the bridge}
<A>__{ferris peers down into the canyon.}
<B>__{in the rapids}
<A>__{cris bobs to the surface and is carried away by the fierce current. the smashed cruiser also gets carried into the river. fighting the current, cris watches as the smashed police cruiser surges ahead of him then disappears! perplexed for a beat, he suddenly understands and desperately swims for a rock and clambers onto it. camera pulls back to reveal that cris is stuck in the middle of the river about five feet from where it drops off into a waterfall!}
<B>__{a helicopter}
<A>__{flies over him.}
<B>__{on the rock}
<A>__{cris looks for a way out. seeing none, he jumps! and is swallowed up in dark thunderous death.}
<D>__{snapback to:}
<B>__{cris}
<A>__{still on the rock. looks up and sees a cable being lowered from the helicopter. he looks around? is there another way out? out of choices, he reaches for the cable. misses! loses his balance. flails. at the last second, he steadies himself. he wants to live. the cable dangles back into range. cris grabs it. the cable is hooked to a pair of handcuffs.}
<B>__{ferris}
<A>__{watches through binoculars as cris snaps one cuff around his wrist and waits. she shouts into her radio.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{cuffs on both wrists. leave him if he doesn't.}
<B>__{baines in helicopter}
<D>__{baines what can he do hanging by one arm?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i don't want to find out.}
<A>__{baines speaks to cris via loudspeaker.}
<D>__{baines both wrists!}
<A>__{on the rock cris, defeated, attaches the second cuff to his other wrist. he is lifted up into the air, hanging by both arms. bridge liz sits, handcuffed, in the back of a second u.s. government helicopter. ferris approaches.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i was wrong about one thing. he is capable of love.}
<B>__{helicopter}
<A>__{descends, with cris hanging below by a cable. mp's are waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around cris, then tape him like a mummy, up to his neck. when he's bound as securely as hannibal lecter, ferris steps close and gets her first good look at him.}
<D>__{ferris cris johnson, we meet at last.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{why does everybody have amnesia but me?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i only ask one thing from you. give me a chance to earn your trust. cris i did, and you failed.}
<A>__{she seems genuinely surprised.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{then give me another chance. you get `em all the time.}
<A>__{she signals and cris is dumped into the waiting helicopter. the door is slammed behind him.}
