<ACTION>__{Annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her magazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of stalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we see indications of the kind of magazine she edits. She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by windows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of which are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE. (One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately around his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing like a member of the royal family.) Annie sits and takes a breath. The only photo on her desk is a family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal Award -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award. She checks her watch -- it is almost 9:30.}

The details that form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as -- Judith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground. They slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit up in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup.}

Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get Judith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays on the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle slipping out of Grace's hand...}

It begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack- knifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith disappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck. Pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some grotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass. And then it is still. The truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse lies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods... The Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees. Grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky.}

LIZ HAMMOND, the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her jacket, quietly walking into the water. A Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. He watches Liz. She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, running upstream. The Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. Frightened, Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo in his neck.

She looks out the window for the first time and sees: A MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young children, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm around his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the father listens to every word. Annie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the platform, she turns back to her laptop.

<ACTION>__{Annie and Grace are standing by the arena fence. Frank, Joe and the Twins are sitting on the fence rail. Joe is holding a saddle and a bridle, standing in some shadows in an empty arena. Pilgrim comes running into the ring. Out of habit, he starts circling the ring. He sees Tom holding a saddle. Pilgrim walks towards him. Curious, he stops, looking at him. Tom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it. Pilgrim walks towards him again. He stops, looking at Tom again. Tom just sits there, playing with the bridle. Pilgrim walks around him. Tom doesn't show him any interest. Pilgrim comes closer. He looks at the saddle. He runs off. He stops, looking back. Tom just sits. Pilgrim walks back over. Tom stands and shows him the bridle. Pilgrim comes closer, sniffing it. He rubs his nose against the leather. Tom pats his head. Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the bridle on him. Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem to bother him. Grace and Annie watch intently. Tom takes the reins, walking Pilgrim around the ring. He walks him to the saddle. Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof. He turns and runs off. Tom lets him go. Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows down, looks over at Tom. Tom picks up the saddle. Pilgrim, cautiously, comes back over. Tom, with the saddle, walks away from him. Pilgrim, again curious, follows him. He nudges Tom. Tom stops. Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the saddle. Tom rubs his back. And gently, like laying down a sheet, puts the saddle on his back. Pilgrim shuffles slightly at the touch. Tom quickly cinches it. Taking up the reins, he walks Pilgrim around the ring again. He starts to jog. Pilgrim jogs with him. And in the middle of the jog, Tom grabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride, pulls himself back up onto his back. He lays across the saddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight. He sits up, and without letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with his thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring. Grace and Annie cheer. Tom tips his hat to them...}

Grace is about to turn and leave, but she stops herself and remains still. Slowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head... and he lets her. We see in Grace a maturity of character, a willingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a compassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as well.}

Ranchers and families move about the ranch, sit and eat at picnic tables with gingham tablecloths... Some teenagers hanging around the corral, talking. Diane and some other women, eating and talking... Frank with a group of men, drinking beer, telling stories. A BAND has been set up by the barn. People are dancing under the harvest moon. Grace is dancing with Joe... Tom is dancing with a local woman... Annie with a rancher... Everyone is having a good time... Robert is enjoying a smoke with some men. He looks over to the dance floor and smiles when he sees Grace and Joe. Joe and the Rancher trade place... Joe dances with Annie, the Rancher with Grace... But Tom sees his chance and switches with the Rancher so that he can dance with Grace... She is thrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor. Joe and Annie are interrupted by another couple. Joe switches partners, but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to rest. Robert continues talking with some of the men. He puts out his smoke and looks over to the dance floor. He sees Grace now dancing with Tom... His eyes search for Annie. He moves away from the men until he sees, from a distance; Annie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd... No one would notice her unless they were looking for her... But Robert does -- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom... then, only looking at Tom... Smiling to herself gently... Watching his every move. Suddenly, she rises and exits out of the barn to get some air.}

Pilgrim looks up at Grace out of the dark pool of his one sad eye. They look at each other. And we understand there's a connection once more. A moment of understanding... and forgiveness. Grace starts to untie his ropes. Smokey is about to stop her but Tom shakes "NO"... Pilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing life for the first time, gets to his feet. Grace and him look to each other. And all is still. Grace grabs the saddle horn. Pilgrim shuffles as if he's going to bolt. Grace quietly reassures him... She then carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup. Pilgrim shifts slightly. Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream out her fear. Robert breaths heavily. They watch as Grace swings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the saddle. Sitting on his back, Pilgrim tosses his head and looks as he's going to run off. But Grace puts her arms around his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him. She starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, talking all the while, around the ring. Annie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her. Robert feels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion... The slow ride turns into a trot... then a lope... then a canter... round and round the ring. Frank and Diane smile. Diane looks to Tom and knows what he's feeling... Tom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with pride for the miracle of his child. But he doesn't let on for a second. Grace brings Pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the heavens, victorious. Everyone cheers. Smokey helps her off the horse. She stops to look at Tom, who busies himself with picking up the ropes... So she re-focuses on her parents. They run to each other and embrace... First, she and Annie... then, she and her father... But, as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit, Annie manages to make eye contact with Tom... and tell him with one look, how grateful she is... and how much she loves him.
