<A>__{the loft is a large, incredibly cool looking space. in one corner is a lab area filled with high tech scientific equipment. at another work station, dozens of drawings, maps, and photos are spread out next to a flat screen computer. a few photos are tacked to a corkboard. several bookshelves, all crammed with books, line one wall. a old framed photograph sits on a bookshelf, a faded photo of twenty children sitting on the front steps of the orphanage. sister clara stands with them. young edward sits to one side. a weapons cabinet features racks lined with guns and blade weapons. in another corner is a work out area. the sleek, modern kitchen and living quarters are in another corner. the bed is set up against a wall of large windows. outside the windows, the sun is setting. approaching the lab area, carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact. he turns it around in his fingers, watching the light glint off it.}
