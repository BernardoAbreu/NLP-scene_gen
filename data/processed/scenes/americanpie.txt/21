<D>__{guy #1 oh, gross.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{jesus, what did you eat?}
<A>__{stifler just keeps hurling. kevin enters, holding the remains of the tainted beer.}

<D>__{stifler, how's the man chowder?!}
<A>__{stifler barfs even more violently.}
<L>__{exterior stifler's house back porch, by the keg night}
<A>__{jessica and vicky are refilling their beers at the keg. nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{he likes it.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{of course he does. what about you? have you just never had one with kevin or have you never had one, period?}
