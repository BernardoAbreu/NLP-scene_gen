<A>__{jack is now dealing to five punters. he has a 10 and a 5 exposed for the house. two players go bust. one player sticks on 19, the next on 20. the last player buys a card for 21. jack turns over an ace for the house. he twists again. it's a 5 making 21. the two losing players groan. the last player is paid evens for equalling the house. one of the players who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves.}
