<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{another angle full figure a woman in blackness.}
<C>__{woman three}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{i'm seventeen now and i've been working the streets for two years and i guess to be honest i stopped thinking of it as temporary.}
<A>__{the lights come up on the room. the two screens go black... there is general applause. jane blinks nervously.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{please don't applaud.}
<B>__{on audience}
<A>__{sitting in groups of three news team from around the country, remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a black or hispanic. they still applaud not yet having grasped the sincerity of jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{please. don't!!}
<P>__{(she yells)}
<D>__{i gathered these pieces as an example of what's wrong with local television news.}
<A>__{the applause stops.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the excerpts from three separate series on prostitution were simultaneously broadcast by all stations in one city during sweeps week. by what bend of either or suspension of duty is that broadcast news?}
<A>__{she pauses half a beat for possible applause hearing none, she continues. an anchorman sneezes four people shout "gesundheit" simultaneously they laugh.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the legacy of edward r. murrow, eric sevareid, william shirer, david brinkley and walter cronkite is being squandered in a desperate popularity contest. our profession is in danger:}
<B>__{tracking shot}
<A>__{as jane continues, revealing that the news team now have even more in common. they do not like jane.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yesterday's compliment has somehow managed to become today's kiss of death. to be considered a serious journalist is no longer flattering. it presents the risk of being labeled ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, right?}
<B>__{shot continues}
<A>__{women playing with their hair, young man bored...one middle aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...}
<B>__{on jane}
<A>__{briefly departing from texterior}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{all of you know what i'm talking about. we're all trying to act together than we are. but we care. so, we're all secretly terrified, aren't we?}
<A>__{not a peep she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice begins to rasp.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{we are being increasingly influenced by the star system. the network anchormen are so powerful they compromise our last best hope. the current group is clearly qualified, tied still to our best traditions, but who follows these men?}
<B>__{tracking shot moves to tom grunick}
<A>__{seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking hispanic. tom feels a growing excitement jane is not just a speaker, she seems a savior.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{his female colleague looks at him.}
<C>__{female colleague}
<D>__{oh, i've known so many women like that. they don't like their looks so they're angry.}
<B>__{back to jane}
<A>__{fumbling with her cards, sunk but game gamer than she would wish.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i was going to talk about other trends but...}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{...the magazine shows, news at profit, influence ofentertainment tonight, the danger, the hope, the dream, the question...oh, i was going to show you a tape a story that was carried by all networks on the same night the same night not one network noted a major policy change in salt two nuclear disarmament talks... here's what they ran instead...go ahead. show the tape.}
<B>__{on monitors}
<A>__{showing the japanese domino championships as broadcast by all networks in the spring of 1985. it is quite spectacular the dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny bridges, setting off little fireworks. jane's audience applauds loudly and squeals with delight.}
<B>__{on scene}
<A>__{jane between the two monitors. she begins to speak loudly over the audience noises of approval.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{i know it's good film. i know it's fun. i like fun. it's just not news.}
<P>__{(as they continue to applaud)}
<D>__{well, you're lucky you love it you're going to get a lot more just like it.}
<A>__{stray voice shout "good"}
<B>__{other angle}
<A>__{jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event. dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart. she takes some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{tom the last person remaining in the room. he approaches her she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap. it takes courage for tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{she looks up at him.}
<B>__{angle on tom}
<A>__{earnest, nervous handsome...just when she needed a mirage there it is.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i just wanted to tell you how great you were. my name's tom grunick.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(dumbly)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{they hated me. i don't hate them.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... and you did that.}
<A>__{jane looks up at his smile a beat then:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{would you like to have dinner with me?}
