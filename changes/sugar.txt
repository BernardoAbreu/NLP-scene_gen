<ACTION>__{A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in progress. A1   ON THE FIELD Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark- skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised for the next pitch. CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZUCAR/SUGAR - 19, lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES the ball toward the plate. THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball slams inside.}

<ACTION>__{The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball. FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS. BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH. As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball. The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely. FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards. ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and kicks the dirt. Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt. Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin. He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air.}
