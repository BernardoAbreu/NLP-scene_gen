<ACTION>__{A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in Harlem. A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform. He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed. Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside.}
<LOC>__{INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM}
<ACTION>__{The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt - The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark. The man checks each stall one at a time. His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL THROUGH.}
<ACTION>__{He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover- A wall of bricks. Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside. A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard. He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen. Silence. His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. The place is empty. The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights. He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist portrait.}

<ACTION>__{He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too frantically- A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground. Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but- HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WATCHING HIM.}
<ACTION>__{Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. A separate being... Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double. The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade. His eyes turn cold with fear when- HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT! IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD. Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end. In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.}

He started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters.

Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel. He struggles to get back on his feet- Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways. Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas pipe. With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens. He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "Anna"... Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The creature thrusts itself against him- THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance. In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE BROKEN GAS PIPE!}

<ACTION>__{STOMACH BUT- Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap. Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment. The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark. Ben stands by- The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires- THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.}

<ACTION>__{THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE- Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart. A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in. Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs. Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben. Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls collapse. Ben runs as fast as he can. "Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly - JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING}

<ACTION>__{The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just an earthquake under the building. In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble begins to move- A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES - It's Ben. He gasps for air. Wounded and covered in dust, it is a miracle that he has survived. He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of concrete to regain the ground floor. Limping, he crosses the entrance hall. His discovery of the absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to be indestructible...}
