<L>__{interior boardwalk hall arena hallway moments later}
<A>__{buzzing in the crowd. another fight close at hand.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{j.j. riley had less than 48 hours to fill marco santos' spot, and he basically had to rely on the word of frank campana.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{and he chose brendan conlon, which quite frankly is something i just don't understand.}
<A>__{brendan and frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena, where paddy is waiting, his all access pass around his neck. brendan notices the old man as he approaches.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{go get `em, son.}
<A>__{brendan barely acknowledges paddy and keeps walking. frank looks at brendan with a "who the hell is that?" expression. as they approach the dark lights of the arena, beethoven continues to boom out over the loud speakers.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{i can understand coming out to no music, by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance?}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{this is beethoven, bryan. this is ode to joy.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{my apologies, mr. renaissance man.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{you want to talk about renaissance men, you gotta talk about frank campana. very unorthodox trainer, and one of the best in the game. he's well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm, to remain patient, and to remain composed under pressure.}
<A>__{brendan and frank make their way through the crowd and toward cageside, where bryan callen reaches beneath his seat.}
<C>__{callen}
<D>__{classical music is about as fitting to this setting as brendan conlon is to this tournament. in fact, let me show you something.}
<A>__{callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a goldfish inside.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{this is brendan conlon. he's a feeder fish, and he's about to get dropped into a shark tank.}
<A>__{brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.}
<C>__{sheridan}
<D>__{c'mon, give the guy a break. at least we've seen him fight before. he was in the ufc. we remember him.}
<C>__{callen}
<D>__{i remember him, too. i remember him being very unmemorable.}
