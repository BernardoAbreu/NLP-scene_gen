<L>__{interior catch's apartment night}
<A>__{he walks into a bare living room no chairs, tables, lamps, nothing on the walls. he walks into a spotless, never used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a drawer. in the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found, some purchased, mostly plastic figures. the action of opening the door has started some battery operated animals moving around in there. now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer. he walks back into the living room. he sits on the floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still soaked from the rain. he stares at his thoughts, looking a bit numb and lost.}
