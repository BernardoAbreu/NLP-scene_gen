<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior hotel carlton lobby later that night}
<A>__{the group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. someone says, "wheeee!" others say, "ssshhh!" they cross to the front desk.}
<B>__{at the front desk}
<A>__{the clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk. nikki is about to wake him when bill bounds forward.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(quietly, to nikki)}
<D>__{sh! let him sleep. what's your number?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{eighty eight.}
<A>__{bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. once they've gone, bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands with a little noise on the other side, without waking the clerk. he cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, then fetches nikki's key from its cubbyhole. bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs around nearly kicking the clerk in the process then silently slides off the desk to the floor. watching the sleeping clerk warily, bill tiptoes away. at the last possible moment, bill purposefully whacks the signal bell with his hand, making it ring noisily. the clerk awakens with a start and grabs a nearby telephone just as bill disappears from view.}
<B>__{in the hotel elevator}
<A>__{amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur". last one in is bill who shuts the door and the metal safety gate behind him.}

<A>__{bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold.}
<C>__{bill}

<D>__{say! how do you stop this thing?}
<A>__{bill brakes the car too quickly it slams to a halt and everyone loses their footing, nearly falling down. part of the light fixture above them breaks loose and crashes down on frink's head, much to everyone's amusement they laugh as frink clutches his head, annoyed.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{that's right, laugh.}
<C>__{cary}

<C>__{shep}
<D>__{nothing doing! let cary take the controls. you'll run us through the roof.}
<A>__{bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{all right, all right.}
