<B>__{epps and jaeger}
<A>__{they fight on; down and dirty. locked together they roll around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand. they smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness. at the same time epps works himself on top of jaeger. he lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into jaeger's skull. all jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow. something catches epps' eye: a glint of light flashes across his faces. he stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps through. the rock slips from his hand. forgetting all about jaeger epps goes to the opening. jaeger himself, as if what just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side epps.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{must be a compartment.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i feel air. probably opens up outside somewhere. that's where the light comes from. couldn't see it with the lanternon.}
<A>__{jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the white dot; light in the dark.}
<A>__{that's all epps needs to hear. he starts clawing at the opening with his bare hands. that gets him nothing. grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it. jaeger gets the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins in. they keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like a southern chain gang.}
<C>__{jaeger }
<D>__{maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's giving.}
<A>__{the rock gives way enough for epps to pry it free. there's just enough space for a man to reach his arm through. for a beat epps and jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid of what mayor may not be in there. with some trepidation epps begins to move his hand towards the opening. slowly it extends closer...closer... just as it moves beyond the opening. vthere is a wild, screeching hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for epps. both epps and jaeger recoil, jaeger going nuts with fear.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{jaeger grabs up his m 16 and takes aim at...whatever it is.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no, don't shoot!}
<A>__{too late. jaeger squeezes off a few rounds. a couple of bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the cave and around epps and jaeger. all the two men can do is duck and cover squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of random death. eventually the bullets lose speed and die off. jaeger and epps raise up off the ground. they walk to the dead thing that jumped from the opening.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's just a mongoose.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{is it dead?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah, bwana, you got it.}
