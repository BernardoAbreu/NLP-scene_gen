<L>__{interior campbell house, master bedroom morning}
<A>__{close in on jacks face, bathed in morning light...he opens his eyes...feels something strange... jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his chest. a look of confusion crosses his face...trying to remember... did he meet a woman last night...? he turns his head to find a large mutt sitting faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail... ...did she have a dog? he looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to get a look at her face. and then he sees her...}
<B>__{...kate reynolds...}
<A>__{...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly... his head darts around the room its cramped and lived in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on the dresser, laura ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed and a charming little bay window. he instinctively reaches for his franck mueller watch on the night stand, but its not there. its a timex indiglo and it reads, 7:57 a.m... jack looks back at kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its a dream...but nothing changes. then, kate stirs...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{mmmm...ten more minutes, jack... its christmas...}
<A>__{jack jumps as he hears kate talk for the first time... suddenly, the door bursts open...a six year old girl, annie, in a little nightgown, walks into the room carrying an 18 month old boy, josh, singing at the top of her lungs...}

<D>__{cmon, dad. get up!}
<A>__{she said dad. thats it. jack moves the baby gingerly over, then gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying next to it. he picks up the bat...the same willie mays autograph bat that was encased in glass in his n.y. apartment. frightened, jack drops the bad, looking down at himself for the first time...hes naked... ...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on the bed... ...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow cardigan off the chair and throws them on... kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{jack...?}
<A>__{jack turns by instinct. kate grabs him, drawing him near. a look of fear on his face as kate opens her eyes... eye contact...jacks certain hes about to hear her scream...}
