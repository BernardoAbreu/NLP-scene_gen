<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror. he wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. he flexes slightly. the valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid section from behind. leopold eyes his reflection seductively. he becomes bored. he turns to his right. the valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. he turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. the valet pats his mouth dry. he affects a pampered strut, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror. finally, as if weighing a great decision, leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{fine linen undervest slides over his head. black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist. the buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar. a cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand. a perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck. an elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso. his hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted. his eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb. his cheeks are pinched. a red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel. leopold stares into the mirror. the effect is dazzling. he raises one eyebrow. then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle:}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you dance like a herd of cattle, miss fairchild. you are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it.}
<A>__{he bows. as he rises, the reflection of leopold's uncle otto, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind leopold in the looking glass.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{tell me leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one sided flash of wit?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i despise affairs of this sort, uncle otto. no one really listens to anyone else. if you attempt it, you will see why.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{you judge everything too severely. i wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you do not wonder at all. you merely ask in order to state your own opinion.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{we are all concerned about you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{ahh, here it comes.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{your life does not seem to have any direction. at the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. at 35 he is too old. now is your time to take action. tell me, what is it you want to do with your life?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{i do not know.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<P>__{(just as weary)}
<D>__{your ignorance cramps my conversation.}
<P>__{(he slaps leopold's}
<D>__{face twice rather}
<P>__{quickly)}
<D>__{wake up! this is your one and only life. every man has the chance to make a difference. do something!}
<A>__{leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. i assure you there is no need for concern. i am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{life is not position, leopold. it is action.}
<P>__{(he straightens leopold's tie)}
<D>__{i will see you downstairs promptly. in the appropriate frame of mind.}
<A>__{he leaves. leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. the valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. leopold shoots him a look. the valet fills the glass higher. leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. he hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. finally...}
<C>__{the valet}
<P>__{(grandly)}
<D>__{go spread joy.}
<A>__{without looking back, leopold leaves the room.}
