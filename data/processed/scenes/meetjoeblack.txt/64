<A>__{joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city, he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows. he stops now at the window of a korean grocery, something has caught his eye, he steps inside. through the window, joe can be seen making a purchase, he hands the korean clerk some money, walks out. joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers. the korean clerk runs out after him.}
