<L>__{interior courtroom. day}
<A>__{hanna is standing being examined by the judge. large photographs and maps of the village, with the lay out of the church, are now on display.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{why did you not unlock the doors?}
<A>__{he waits. hanna doesn't reply.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{why did you not unlock the doors?}
<A>__{the judge turns to the row of defendants.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i've asked all of you and i'm getting no answer. two of the victims are in this court. they deserve an answer.}
<A>__{ilana and rose are not far away from michael and the students. the judge puts down a bound handwritten document.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{here, this is the ss report. you all have copies.}
<A>__{there is a flurry of paperwork among the defendants and lawyers as they turn to their copies.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event. in the written report, you all claim you didn't even know about the fire until after it happened. but that isn't true, is it?}
<A>__{the judge waits.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{well? it isn't true.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i don't know what you're asking.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the first thing i'm asking is, why didn't you unlock the doors?}
<A>__{hanna takes a look to the other defendants. for the first time her poise is crumbling.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{obviously. for the obvious reason. we couldn't.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{why? why couldn't you?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we were guards. our job was to guard the prisoners. we couldn't just let them escape.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i see. and if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you'd be charged, you might even be executed?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{well then?}
<A>__{the judge waits.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{if we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos. how could we have restored order?}
<C>__{hanna }
<D>__{it happened so fast. it was snowing. the bombs there were flames all over the village. then the screaming began. it got worse and worse. and if they'd all come rushing out, we couldn't just let them escape. we couldn't. we were responsible for them.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{so you did know what was happening? you did know? you made a choice. you let them die rather than risk letting them escape.}
<A>__{hanna can't answer she has no answer.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the other defendants have made an allegation against you. have you heard this allegation?}
<A>__{hanna does not reply.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{they say you were in charge.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it isn't true. i was just one of the guards.}
<A>__{the other defendants interrupt to call out `she was in charge'.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{did you write the report?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. no. we all discussed what to say. we all wrote it together.}
<C>__{beckhart}
<D>__{she wrote it! she wrote the report. she was in charge.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. and i didn't write the report. does it matter who did?}
<A>__{rita beckhart has called out from her place. the judge looks at hanna a moment.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i need to see a sample of your handwriting.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{my handwriting?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{yes. i need to establish who wrote the report.}
<A>__{at once hanna's counsel rises.}
<C>__{hanna's counsel}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i really don't see how that's appropriate. nearly twenty years have gone by.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{somebody take her this piece of paper.}
<C>__{hanna's counsel}
<D>__{are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{give her the paper. counsel, approach the bench.}
<A>__{a piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of hanna. her counsel moves to the bench. michael stares, first at her, then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him.}
