<L>__{interior war ministry olbricht's office day}
<A>__{looking out at the shocked faces of olbricht, mertz, beck and stauffenberg. pull back to reveal: olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with german officers all of them standing in silence, looking at the leaders of the resistance with great respect. stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts, solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks. a young officer steps forward. he looks hauntingly like the lieutenant who drove stauffenberg in africa.}
<C>__{young officer}
<D>__{colonel stauffenberg, sir. we're reporting for duty.}
<A>__{stauffenberg is moved beyond words. suddenly, what was once a small clutch of discarded generals and politicians is now a movement of motivated men. stauffenberg nods, collects himself. in the crowd he finds helldorf, the head of the berlin police, whom we met earlier. at first he speaks quietly, humbled.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{helldorf, i'm... glad to see you. we're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. can we count on the police?}
<C>__{helldorf}
<D>__{there's a lot of talk that hitler isn't really dead. is this true?}
<A>__{awkward pause. good question. the men in the room share nervous glances. then all eyes on stauffenberg.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i can't offer you any guarantees. the decision is yours and yours alone. can we count on you?}
<A>__{long pause. pan across the uneasy faces of the men in the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what helldorf does before making their decisions. finally:}
<C>__{helldorf}
<D>__{i'm with you.}
<A>__{stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. there is a palpable shift in the room. one by one, the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{have your men surround the building. no one gets in or out of here without my permission.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{i want every available soldier on task we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. dismissed.}
<A>__{the soldiers move, but beck's voice stops them surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. we represent a different form of government. we represent what is good and just in germany.}
