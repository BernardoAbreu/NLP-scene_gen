<L>__{interior radiator springs museum day}
<A>__{close on the piston cup. it has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of doc. it says "hudson hornet piston cup."}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wow. i can't believe they renamed the piston cup after our very own doc hudson.}
<A>__{mcqueen and mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. mcqueen approaches a "hudson hornet" wall with doc's three piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i know doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, doc would've been real proud of you. that's for sure.}
<A>__{mcqueen takes this in.}
