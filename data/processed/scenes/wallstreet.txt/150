<L>__{exterior gekko office building day}
<A>__{bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside.}
<L>__{exterior bud's condo day}
<A>__{darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.}
<L>__{interior bud's condo day}
<A>__{bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in front of him. outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette. darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room. a broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage...}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{bud?...what's going on?}
<A>__{she puts down the grocery bags, frightened.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i've been played like a grand piano by the master, gekko the great...and today was the big crash. liquidation sale. he's gonna carve bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off...}
<A>__{darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i was afraid something like this could happen.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. i handed it to him on a silver platter. i told my father and those people...}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{i'm not gonna let it happen darien.}
<A>__{she stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{don't cross gordon. he'll crush you. you've worked hard to get where you are. if gordon doesn't buy bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{at least i wouldn't be pulling the trigger.}
<A>__{she sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{are you mad! why are you doing this! we're so close, the town is going to be ours. don't throw away your future bud!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i can stay with the brokerage firm. and you're doing fine. we can survive without gordon gekko.}
<C>__{darien}
<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{i'm not looking to just survive. i've been doing that all my life.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(getting the drift)}
<D>__{what the hell's that supposed to mean?}
<A>__{darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{that if you make an enemy of gordon gekko, i won't be there to stand by you.}
<A>__{bud is stunned...and hurt.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you really mean that?}
<P>__{(lashing out)}
<D>__{what'd he promise you? to take you public? i guess without gordon's money and seal of approval, i'm not such a hot investment anymore. you're just the best money can buy, darien...}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you're not exactly pure bud, you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. look in the mirror before...}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(glaring at her)}
<D>__{i'm looking...and i sure don't like what i see.}
<A>__{she collects her things and walks to the door.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{fair enough...but it's not that simple, bud. when i was down and had nothing, it was gordon who helped me. he got me all my clients you among them...}
<P>__{(snaps her fingers)}
<D>__{and he can take it away like that.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you may find out one day that when you've had money and lost it, it's worse than never having had it at all.}
<A>__{bud steps across to her in a rage.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that's bullshit! step out that door, i'm changing the locks.}
<A>__{she opens the door saddened.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you. i think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{get the hell out!}
<A>__{she does. bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated.... the loss is not just darien, it is total... he looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...}
