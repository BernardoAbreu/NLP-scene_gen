<L>__{interior hallway night (kirsty's p.o.v.)}
<A>__{the thunder fills kirsty's head, as she stares at larry, who has opened his arms to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{come to daddy.}
<A>__{her gaze moves up to julia, who is on the stairs.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no, damn you }
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(mouths)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{everything is slowing down. the bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. larry smiles, as kirsty moves towards him. tears have begun to fill her eyes. she searches for him. his smile decays as he realizes her objective. her nails rake his cheek. the flesh puckers, and tears along the brow. blood flows. the mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and frank's twisted features come into view.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{frank!}
<A>__{kirsty screams, as frank lunges for her. the lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. kirsty avoids frank's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door. she's trapped. his torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood stained) and pulls a knife from the lining. suddenly, julia is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. frank advances on kirsty, but in the last moment before the fatal stab kirsty twists, avoiding the blow. julia shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. kirsty slips from between them. julia collapses into frank's arms. he holds her up. kirsty makes a dive for the front door, but frank lets julia slip and intercepts kirsty. julia falls back against the wall, dying. kirsty retreats to the bottom of the stairs. frank follows.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're not leaving now }
<A>__{as he follows, julia reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve. kirsty flees the only route she can, upstairs. the house is creaking in every board and rafter now. frank turns on julia, trapping her against the wall.,}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{help me, frank. for god's sake.}
<A>__{he puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her. at the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no, frank }
<A>__{from the stairs kirsty glimpses him battering upon her. then she looks away, and runs up the stairs. when we look back julia is withering in frank's arms.}
