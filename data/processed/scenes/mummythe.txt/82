<T>__{we cut wide:}
<A>__{somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased mob, we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream...}
<L>__{interior exterior convertible streets night}
<A>__{the convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. we dolly across the hood of the car from jonathan to evelyn to o'connell. ardeth ray and the curator are still in the back. all of them staring out the front windshield. freaked out. then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls crashes through the windshield! everybody screams. jonathan hits the gas, loses control, the car slams into a wall. o'connell grabs evelyn.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{c'mon! c'mon! let's go! let's go!}
<A>__{they all leap out of the car. but the angry, festering mob quickly surrounds them. o'connell quickly reaches into his gunny sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a match. he looks around for a way to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across ardeth ray's stubbly face. ardeth ray yelps. o'connell holds the lit match near the fuse. the crazed, chanting mob gives o'connell a wide berth, staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes. and then imhotep steps through, having fully regenerated, he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the day he was buried alive. evelyn stares at him.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he's gorgeous.}
<A>__{o'connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. he yelps and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it across ardeth ray's face again. ardeth ray yelps and gives o'connell a look to kill. the curator shakes his head.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{he has consummated the curse, now all he need do is raise anck su namun from the dead, then it will be the end of us, and the beginning for them.}
<A>__{imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. o'connell lights the fuse. imhotep steps up to o'connell and stops, watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. the tension mounts. the lit fuse is about to vanish inside the stick of dynamite, blowing it up, when evelyn leans forward and blows it out. o'connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on imhotep, who extends his hand to evelyn.}
<C>__{imhotep}
<D>__{koontash dai na.}
<A>__{beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{take his hand and he will spare the others.}
<A>__{evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, waiting to pounce, then she looks at imhotep, confident, powerful, invincible. then she looks at o'connell.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{any bright ideas?}
<A>__{o'connell talks through angry, grit teeth.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{sorry, fresh out.}
<A>__{evelyn looks back at imhotep, then starts to reach out to take his hand. both o'connell and jonathan move to stop her, but ardeth ray grabs them both and holds them tight.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{don't do it, evelyn.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i have no choice.}
<A>__{evelyn's trembling hand touches imhotep's: his hand closes around hers. nothing happens. imhotep smiles.}
<C>__{imhotep}
<D>__{keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{come with me my princess. it is time to make you mine, forever.}
<A>__{evelyn gives beni a nasty look, correcting him }
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{all eternity, idiot.}
<A>__{then she looks at o'connell and puts on her best face.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you better think of something, because if he turns me into a mummy, you're the first one i'm coming after.}
<A>__{o'connell almost smiles.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{got guts, lady.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, i know, and i'd like to keep them.}
<A>__{imhotep suddenly notices something. he reaches forward and rips the key box out of jonathan's upper jacket pocket.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hey that's mine !}
<A>__{ardeth ray holds jonathan back. imhotep pulls evelyn away. o'connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of ardeth ray's grip.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{evelyn!}
<A>__{the huge, powerful man holds him tight.}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{be calm. there is still time. we can stop him yet.}
<A>__{the crowd parts for imhotep and evelyn. and then imhotep stops and looks back at o'connell.}
<C>__{imhotep}
<D>__{pared oos.}
<A>__{evelyn screams.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{nooo!!}
<A>__{beni smiles.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{kill them.}
<A>__{imhotep pulls her away. o'connell breaks free of ardeth ray's grip and stumbles forward.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{evelyn!}
<A>__{but the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill. o'connell quickly bends down, pulls open a cistern manhole cover and shoves jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after him. the curator pushes ardeth ray towards the cistern hole.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{go! find a way! kill the creature!}
<A>__{the curator turns and throws himself at the mob as ardeth ray crawls down into the hole. the mob tears the curator apart.}
