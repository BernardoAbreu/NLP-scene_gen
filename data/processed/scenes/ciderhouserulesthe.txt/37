<L>__{interior dining hall morning}
<A>__{the children are eating breakfast as the would be parents walk around the tables, looking over the assembled orphans. curly works on his table manners; he forks and eats a piece of pancake with elegance. angela and edna try to make the couple slow down by the older children, but the couple stop and stare at the adorable hazel.}
<L>__{interior baby room morning}
<A>__{larch and homer are examining the babies. the doctors are checking the babies' grips, their eyes, ears, and throats. angela appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{life is waiting.}
<A>__{angela disappears. larch looks at the next baby's record (attached to the bed).}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{where's the name sheet?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{nobody's named this one yet.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{it's my turn!}
<A>__{homer is tired of this game. larch touches the child's forehead with his index finger.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{henceforth you shall be... little dorrit!}
<A>__{the baby starts to cry.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{he doesn't like it.}
<P>__{(looks at the record)}
<D>__{he's a boy, that's why.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{can't a boy be a dorrit?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{you do it then.}
<A>__{homer points his finger at the child's forehead like a gun.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{henceforth you shall be... little wilbur.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i'm not crazy about the "little..."}
<A>__{homer is writing the name.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{okay, he's just a wilbur then.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{we haven't had a wilbur here in a year or so, have we? we used to have dozens!}
<A>__{they are interrupted by copperfield, who comes running from the corridor.}
<C>__{copperfield}
<D>__{they picked hazel! the idiots chose hazel!}
