<D>__{... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine...}

<L>__{interior william's house day}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{spike!}
<A>__{the house has far too many things in it. definitely two bachelor flat. spike appears. an unusual looking fellow. he has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun. he wears only shorts.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{even he. hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{this is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{that's right i'm at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure i've picked the right t shirt.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what are the choices?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{well... wait for it...}
<P>__{(he pulls on a t shirt)}
<D>__{first there's this one...}
<A>__{the t shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere. it says 'i love blood.'}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{point taken.}
<A>__{he heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{i suspect you'll prefer the next one.}
<A>__{and he re enters in a white t shirt, with a large arrow, pointing down to his flies, saying, 'get it here.'}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{cool, huh?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes she might think you don't have true love on your mind.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{wouldn't want that...}
<P>__{(and back up he goes)}
<D>__{okay just one more.}
<A>__{he comes down wearing it. lots of hearts, saying, 'you're the most beautiful woman in the world.'}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, yes, that's perfect. well done.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{thanks. great. wish me luck.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{spike turns and walks upstairs proudly. revealing that on the back of the t shirt, also printed in big letters, is written 'fancy a fuck?'}
<L>__{exterior portobello road day}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{and so it was just another hopeless wednesday, as i set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever. this is work, by the way, my little travel book shop...}
<A>__{a small unpretentious store... named 'the travel book co.'}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{... which, well, sells travel books and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those.}
<A>__{william enters.}
<L>__{interior the bookshop day}
<A>__{it is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere, with little secret bits round corners with even more books. martin, william's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically. he is very keen, an uncrushable optimist. perhaps without cause. a few seconds later, william stands gloomily behind the desk.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{classic. absolutely classic. profit from major sales push minus $b!r(j347.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{shall i go get a cappuccino? ease the pain.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes, better get me a half. all i can afford.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i get your logic. demi capu coming up.}
<A>__{he salutes and bolts out the door as he does, a woman walks in. we only just glimpse her. cut to william working. he looks up casually. and sees something. his reaction is hard to read. after a pause...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{it is anna scott, the biggest movie star in the world here in his shop. the most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth. when she speaks she is very self assured and self contained.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, thanks. i will just look around.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{she wanders over to a shelf as he watches her and picks out a quite smart coffee table book.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that book's really not good just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. you'd be wasting your money.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. this one though is... very good.}
<A>__{he picks up a book on the counter.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey, which helps. there's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks. i will think about it.}
<A>__{william suddenly spies something odd on the small tv monitor beside him.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{if you could just give me a second.}
<A>__{her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill fitting clothes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bad news.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{we've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so, i saw you put that book down your trousers.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what book?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the one down your trousers.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{i haven't got a book down my trousers.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right well, then we have something of an impasse. i tell you what i will call the police and, what can i say? if i'm wrong about the whole book down the trousers scenario, i really apologize.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{okay what if i did have a book down my trousers?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, ideally, when i went back to the desk, you'd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. see you in a sec.}
<A>__{he returns to his desk. in the monitor we just glimpse, as does william, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves. the thief drifts out towards the door. anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry about that...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, that's fine. i was going to steal one myself but now i've changed my mind. signed by the author, i see.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes, we couldn't stop him. if you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.}
<A>__{she smiles. suddenly the thief is there.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{can i have your autograph?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{rufus.}
<A>__{she signs his scruffy piece of paper. he tries to read it.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, that's the signature and above, it says 'dear rufus you belong in jail.'}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{nice one. would you like my phone number?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tempting but... no, thank you.}
<A>__{thief leaves.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i think i will try this one.}
<A>__{she hands william a $b!r(j20 note and the book he said was rubbish. he talks as he handles the transaction.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh right on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad. actually it's a sort of masterpiece really. none of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days. and i will throw in one of these for free.}
<A>__{he drops in one of the signed books.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things.}
<A>__{she looks at him with a slight smile.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{and leaves. she's out of his life forever. william is a little dazed. seconds later martin comes back in.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{cappuccino as ordered.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thanks. i don't think you'll believe who was just in here.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{who? someone famous?}
<A>__{but william's innate natural english discretion takes over.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no. no one no one.}
<A>__{they set about drinking their coffees.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it? do you know this is pretty incredible actually i once saw ringo starr. or at least i think it was ringo. it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,' toppy.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{topol.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's right topol.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but ringo starr doesn't look anything like topol.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no, well... he was quite a long way away.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so it could have been neither of them?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. it's not a classic anecdotes, is it?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{not classic, no.}
<A>__{martin shakes his head. william drains his cappuccino.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right want another one?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes. no, wait let's go crazy i will have an orange juice.}
<L>__{exterior portobello road day}
<A>__{william sets off.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{william collects his juice in a coffee shop on westbourne park road.}
<L>__{exterior portobello road day}
<A>__{william swings out of the little shop he turns the corner of portobello road and bumps straight into anna. the orange juice, in its foam cup, flies. it soaks anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{here, let me help.}
<A>__{he grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{he jumps back.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nothing, nothing... look, i live just over the street you could get cleaned up.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no thank you. i need to get my car back.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i also have a phone. i'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non prostitute sense obviously.}
<A>__{in his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being genuinely annoyed. she turns and looks at him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{okay. so what does 'just over the street' mean give it to me in yards.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{eighteen yards. that's my house there.}
<A>__{he doesn't lie it is eighteen yards away. she looks down. she looks up at him.}
<L>__{interior william's house corridor day}
<A>__{they enter. she carries a few stylish bags.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{come on in. i will just...}
<A>__{william runs in further it's a mess. he kicks some old shoes under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard. she enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's not that tidy, i fear.}
<A>__{and he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books from her...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there.}
<A>__{she heads upstairs.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{william is tidying up frantically. then he hears anna's feet on the stairs. she walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket. with her trainers still on. he is dazzled by the sight of her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{would you like a cup of tea before you go?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{orange juice probably not.}
<A>__{he moves to his very empty fridge and offers its only contents.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{something else cold coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really, no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{would you like something to nibble apricots, soaked in honey quite why, no one knows because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless there we go yours if you want them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{do you always say 'no' to everything?}
<A>__{pause. she looks at him deep.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i better be going. thanks for your help.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you're welcome and, may i also say... heavenly.}
<A>__{it has taken a lot to get this out loud. he is not a smooth talking man.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{take my one chance to say it. after you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.}
<A>__{she smiles. she's cool.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. well. my pleasure.}
<A>__{he guides her towards the door.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nice to meet you. surreal but nice.}
<A>__{in a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door. he closes the door and shakes his head in wonder. then...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{'surreal but nice.' what was i thinking?}
<A>__{... he shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence. there's a knock on the door. he moves back, casually...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{coming.}
<A>__{he opens the door. it's her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh hi. forget something?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i forgot my bag.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh right.}
<A>__{he shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping bag. then returns and hands it to her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks. well...}
<A>__{they stand in that corridor in that small space. second time saying goodbye. a strange feeling of intimacy. she leans forward and she kisses him. total silence. a real sense of the strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his. they part.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. disaster...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't worry about it. i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpointerior}
<A>__{suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh my god. my flatmate. i'm sorry there's no excuse for him.}
<A>__{spike walks in.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{i'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food and then i'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.}
<A>__{and leaves them in the corridor.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{probably best not tell anyone about this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. no one. i mean, i will tell myself sometimes but... don't worry i won't believe it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{and she leaves, with just a touch of william's hand. spike comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{there's something wrong with this yogurt.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's not yogurt it's mayonnaise.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{well, there you go.}

<A>__{the lights are off. william and spike on the couch, just the light from the tv playing on their faces. cut to the tv full screen. there is anna. she is in a stylish woody allen type modern romantic comedy, 'gramercy park,' in black and white.}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{smile.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i've got nothing to smile about.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay in about 7 seconds, i'm going to ask you to marry me.}
<A>__{and after a couple of seconds wow she smiles.}

<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{oh right. how about that new john grisham thriller?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, that's a novel too.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{oh right. have you got a copy of 'winnie the pooh'?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{martin your customer.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{william looks up. at that moment the entire window is suddenly taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light and entirely covered with a portrait of anna from her new film, 'helix.'}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{there never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{right. vicious circle. and then i was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and i thought cool. kind of spacey.}
<L>__{exterior william's terrace day}
<A>__{the two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day. william is reading 'the bookseller.' the terrace is small and the plants aren't great but it overlooks london in a rather wonderful way. spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.}

<D>__{yeh unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. four o'clock could be good.}

<A>__{he approaches the lifts. at the lift, he pushes the button and the doors open. as he is getting in, william is joined by a young man. his name is tarquin.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{which floor?}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{william pushes the button. they wait for the doors to close.}
<L>__{interior ritz corridor day}
<A>__{the lift lands. william gets out. so does tarquin. rooms}
<L>__{30 35 are to the left. 35 39 to the right. william heads right.}
<A>__{so does tarquin. william is puzzled. he slows down as he approaches room 38. so does tarquin. william spots, so does tarquin. william points at the number.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{are you sure you...?}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh. right.}
<A>__{he knocks. a bright, well tailored american girl opens the door.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{hello, i'm karen. sorry things are running a bit late. here's the thing...}
<A>__{she hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits, with the poster picture of anna, for the film 'helix.'}
<L>__{interior the trafalgar suite ante room day}
<A>__{a few seconds later they enter the main waiting room. there are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what did you think of the film?}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{marvellous. 'close encounters' meets 'jean de florette.' oscar winning stuff.}
<A>__{they both turn to william for his opinion.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't get down what magazines you're from.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{'time out.'}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{great. and you...}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(seeing it on a coffee table)}
<D>__{'horse and hound.' the name's william whacker. i think she might be expecting me.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay take a seat. i will check.}
<A>__{they sit down as karen goes off.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{you've brought her flowers?}
<A>__{william goes for the cover up.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no they're... for my grandmother. she's in a hospital nearby. thought i'd kill two birds with one stone.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{i'm sorry. which hospital?}
<A>__{pause. he's in trouble.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{do you mind me not saying it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{oh sure. of course.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{mr. thacker.}
<A>__{saved by the bell.}
<L>__{interior trafalgar suit corridor day}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i brought these, but clearly...}
<A>__{there are lots of other flowers in the room.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh no, ho these are great.}
<A>__{a fair amount of tension. these two people hardly know each other and the first and last time they met, they kissed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry about not ringing back. the whole two names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea sized intellect.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, it's a stupid privacy thing. i always choose a cartoon character last time out, i was mrs. bambi.}
<A>__{at which moment jeremy, karen's boss, comes in. a fairly grave, authoritative fifty year old pr man consulting a list.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{and you are from 'horse and hound' magazine?}
<A>__{william nods.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is that so?}
<A>__{william shrugs his shoulders. jeremy settles at a little desk in the corner and makes notes. a pause. william feels he has to act the part. they sit in chairs opposite each other.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so i will just fire away, shall i?}
<A>__{anna nods.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. ahm... the film's great... and i just wondered whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ahm well we would have liked to but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{obviously. very difficult.}
<A>__{jeremy leaves. william puts his head in his hands. he was panic.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm sorry i arrived outside they thrust this thing into my hand i didn't know what to do.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, it's my fault, i thought this would all be over by now. i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. i seriously don't know what got in to me. i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{absolutely fine about it.}
<A>__{re enter jeremy.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{do remember that miss scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh yes excellent. ahm any horses in that one? or hounds, of course. our readers are equally intrigued by both species.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it takes place on a submarine.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. right... but if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing?}
<A>__{jeremy exits.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm just a complete moron. sorry. this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams not in real life. good dreams, obviously it's a dream to see you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and what happens next in the dream?}
<A>__{it's a challenge.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, i suppose in the dream dream scenario. i just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen.}
<A>__{pause. then they move towards each other when... jeremy enters.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{time's up, i'm afraid. sorry it was so short. did you get what you wanted?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{very nearly.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{maybe time for one last question?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{jeremy goes out it's their last seconds.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{are you busy tonight?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they look at each other. jeremy enters, with another journalists in tow. anna and william stand and shake hands formally.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, it was nice to meet you. surreal but nice.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thank you. you are 'horse and hound's' favorite actress. you and black beauty. tied.}
<L>__{interior trafalgar suite corridor day}
<A>__{william exits fairly despondent and heads for the door. tarquin is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{how was she?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{fabulous.}
<C>__{tarquin}
<D>__{wait a minute she took your grandmother's flowers?}
<A>__{william can't think his way out of this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. that's right. bitch.}
<A>__{he turns to go, but is accosted by karen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.}

<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{splendid. i'm actually in the stock market, so not really similar fields, though i have done some amateur stuff p.g. wodehouse, you know farce, all that. 'ooh careful there, vicar.' always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. i mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, they can be.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i see friends from university clever chaps been in the business longer than you they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. it's no life. what sort of acting do you do?}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{i will show you.}
<A>__{a moment's silence as they leave then in a split second the others all turn to william.}

<D>__{oh god. oh god. oh goddy god.}
<A>__{the horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds. honey re enters.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{i don't believe it. i walked into the loo with her. i was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans... she had to ask me to leave.}
<L>__{interior max and bella's conservatory night}

<D>__{i'm a vegetarian.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{oh god.}
<L>__{interior max and bella's conservatory night}
<A>__{moving on through the evening they are very relaxed, as they eat dinner. a few seconds watching the evening going well anna is taking this in real friends relaxed easy, teasing. and there's a cake. honey wears bernie's unsuitable hat. anna watches william laughing at something and then putting his head in his hands with mock shame.}
<L>__{interior max and bella's conservatory night}
<A>__{coffee time.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{having you here, anna, firmly establishes what i've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under achievers.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shame!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, i think it's something we should take pride in. i'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.}
<A>__{a little pause. then william turns to bernie.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bernie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{well, obviously it's me, isn't it i work in the city in a job i don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me. i haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{nonsense. i fancy you. or i did before you got so far.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you see and unless i'm much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money, while honey here, she earns nothing flogging her guts out at london's seediest record store.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{yes. and i don't have hair i've got feathers, and i've got funny goggly eyes, and i'm attracted to cruel men and ... no one'll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you see incredibly sad.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{on the other hand, her best friend is anna scott.}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{that's true, i can't deny it. she needs me, what can i say?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{and most of her limbs work. whereas i'm stuck in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. and to add insult to serious injury i've totally given up smoking, my favourite thing, and the truth is... we can't have a baby.}
<A>__{dead silence.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bella.}
<A>__{bella shrugs her shoulders. bernie is totally grief struck.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{no. not true...}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{c'est la vie... we're lucky in lots of ways, but... surely it's worth a brownie.}
<A>__{william reaches for her hand. max breaks the sombre mood.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, i don't know. look at william. very unsuccessful professionally. divorced. used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy around the edges and absolutely certain never to hear from anna again after she's heard that his nickname at school was floppy.}
<A>__{they all laugh. anna smiles across at william.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so i get the brownie?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i think you do, yes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait a minute. what about me?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry? you think you deserve the brownie?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well... a shot at it.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you'll have to prove it. this is a great brownie and i'm going to fight for it. state your claim.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, i've been on a diet since i was nineteen, which means basically i've been hungry for a decade. i've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...}
<C>__{honey}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really and one day, not long from now...}
<A>__{while she says this, quiet settles around the table. the thing is she sort of means it and is opening up to them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{... my looks will go, they'll find out i can't act and i will become a sad middle aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.}
<A>__{silence... they all look at her... then.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{nah!!! nice try, gorgeous but you don't fool anyone.}
<A>__{the mood is instantly broken. they all laugh.}
<C>__{william}

<A>__{anna's twinkle fades.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{you know some girls, they're all 'stay away chum' but anna, she's absolutely gagging for it. do you know that in over fifty percent of languages the word for "actress" is the same as the word for "prostitute."}
<A>__{this is horrible.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{and anna is your definitive actress someone really filthy you can just flip over...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right, that's it.}

<A>__{he's not a very convincing or frightening figure.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{...the person you're talking about is a real person and i think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her...}
