<D>__{he'll be fine, molly. city point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for general grant.}
<A>__{mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the war will take our son! a sniper, or a shrapnel shell! or typhus, same as took willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! he'll die, uselessly, and how will i ever forgive you? most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret!}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{that's not true }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and if the slaughter of cold harbor is on your hands same as grant, god help us! we'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear blood }
<A>__{lincoln rises from the window seat, angry.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{just, just this once, mrs. lincoln, i demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! you imagine robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?!}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(with a mocking smile:)}
<D>__{and if i refuse to take the high road, if i won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when i couldn't stop crying over willie, when i showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me }
<C>__{lincoln mary}
<A>__{that's right. when you i was in the room with refused so much as to comfort willie, i was holding him in tad my arms as he died!}
<C>__{lincoln mary}
<A>__{ the child who was not only how dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief?}
<C>__{lincoln mary}
<A>__{oh but your grief, your how dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief!}
<C>__{lincoln mary}
<A>__{and his mother won't let him i couldn't let tad in! i near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry i was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! i ought to have done it, i ought have done for tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, i should have clapped you in the madhouse!}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{then do it! do it! don't you threaten me, you do it this time! lock me away! you'll have to, i swear, if robert is killed!}
<A>__{silence. then:}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i couldn't tolerate you grieving so for willie because i couldn't permit it in myself, though i wanted to, mary. i wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. i still do. every day i do. don't... talk to me about grief.}
<P>__{(beat:)}
<D>__{i must make my decisions, bob must make his, you yours. and bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. what i carry within me you must allow me to do it, alone as i must. and you alone, mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. as you choose.}
<A>__{she opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room.}
