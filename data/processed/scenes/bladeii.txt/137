<L>__{interior caliban industries elevated corridor night}
<A>__{damaskinos leads them down a corridor.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{jared nomak is your genetic brother. and i suppose if you follow that line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, then these are your offspring.}
<A>__{damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a button. a pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:}
<B>__{the eugenics chamber}
<A>__{we are in a vast, multitiered, temperature controlled chamber equal parts 21st century medical facility and hammer house of horror. a network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber, the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask, which is in turn ringed by a safety railing. the operation looks not unlike a small scale water purification plant, or perhaps a futuristic distillery. only in this instance, the liquid churning within the cask is human blood.}
<B>__{tiny embryos}
<A>__{each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo cases. there are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with stretch from the floor on upwards. as damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see another embryo behind it. that cryo case now slides forward with a whir, taking the place of the one which damaskinos removed. like some kind of perverse vending machine. god knows how deep they're stacked. if thousands are visible, there could be tens of thousands in total. damaskinos holds the translucent cryo case up to the light. the embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.}
<C>__{damaskinos }
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{a new breed, begotten from your own flesh. immune to silver, even sunlight.}
<P>__{(stepping towards blade)}
<D>__{the wolves have lain with the sheep long enough. no more compromises. no more deals. only closure.}
<A>__{boom! we hear the tread of heavy footsteps approaching. all eyes turn towards a side corridor.}
<B>__{reinhardt}
<A>__{enters from the shadows, holding scud's rail gun. much of his face has been burnt away, leaving him with a ghastly death's head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{put it back in park, blade.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{thought you were dead.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.}
<A>__{as reinhardt aims the rail gun at blade, a dozen vampire guards appear on the catwalks above, also taking aim.}
<C>__{reinhardt }
<D>__{six thousand feet per second, isn't that what whistler said? let's see you dodge this one }
<A>__{blade does his level best, pulling his mach, squeezing off a shot even as reinhardt fires. ba bang! blade is hit in the side, spun clear around. his shot goes wild, hitting one of the guards in the head, turning him to ash as blade himself falls to the floor.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{blade!}
<A>__{blade gasps in shock. the rail gun needles have ripped a brutal hole through the side of his chest plate. he clutches at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping between his fingers. as he sits forward, we see more flechettes have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn completely through him. whistler steps forward. one of the vampire sentries lashes out, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle. whistler sinks to his knees, stunned. the guard disarms him.}
<B>__{on blade}
<A>__{gritting his teeth against the pain. he reaches inside his combat harness, pulling out the remote detonator for the explosive flechette in reinhardt's skull.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{kiss your ass goodbye, reinhardt.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{you're wasting your time, blade. the flechette's a dud.}
<A>__{scud crosses over to reinhardt's side. whistler stares at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{it was never supposed to explode. all it was supposed to do was make you feel like you were in control.}
<A>__{blade's eyes darken with hatred. reinhardt laughs.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{thought you had me on a short leash, didn't you, chief? only it turns out, you're the one that's been on the leash.}
<A>__{reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed flechette from his skull. as he does so, blade's remote detonator beeps to indicate it's being tempered with. reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly.}
<C>__{reinhardt }
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{reinhardt tosses the fletchette to scud, who grins, flipping down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{see, i'm one of damaskinos' familiars.}
<A>__{blade looks to nyssa who averts her gaze.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{yeah, your little cootchie knew.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you little shit. when did they get to you?}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{back when blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass. what's up with your hair, anyway? fucking willie nelson look a like?}
<A>__{scud punches whistler in the face.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{man, i so wanted to do that.}
<A>__{scud shakes his hand, which is smarting from the blow. he looks to blade now, angry.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{and you. you never cared about me. i gave you everything. all you cared about was digging up the old fuck! you think they scoped out my security system?}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i let them in. dude, i practically gave 'em the fucking keys. i've been feeding damaskinos information the whole time. providing them with samples of your genetic material helping them with the reaper program. they're close, blade. right up against it. any day now, they're all going to be daywalkers. and when that happens, well, let's just say, i don't want to be on the losing team. you may be strong, you may be fast, but in the end, you're just too human, b.}
<A>__{he pinches blade's cheek. then he stands up.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{so that's down and dirty. got anything to say for yourself?}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(weak, but defiant)}
<D>__{two things. one, i was on to you the moment they turned you. and two }
<P>__{(raising the detonator; smiling)}
<D>__{i switched that dud of yours back with the real one.}
<A>__{scud has a split second of terrified, wide eyed realization before blade pushes the button and boom! the flechette in scud's hand explodes, blowing his body apart, spraying those nearest him with blood. primarily reinhardt.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{as the others react with varying degrees of surprise and horror, reinhardt savagely kicks blade across the face. he hits blade again and again, driving him down to the floor. then he bends and tugs the sword from blade's back scabbard, preparing to cut his throat.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{reinhardt!}
<A>__{reinhardt hesitates. nyssa takes a step towards blade, but damaskinos stops her. damaskinos gestures to his guards. they haul blade up and drag him from the lab. reinhardt gestures to whistler.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{what about him, then?}
<P>__{(crossing to whistler, handcuffing him)}
<D>__{me and hobo kelly here have a little unfinished business.}
<A>__{damaskinos waves dismissively. reinhardt takes whistler away.}
