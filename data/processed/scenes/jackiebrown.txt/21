<L>__{exterior oldsmobile night}
<A>__{the olds is parked out in the middle of some urban nowhere. ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and walks to the back of the olds. he sticks his key in the trunk and says;}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{don't worry. it's just me.}
<A>__{the trunk opens. beaumont is hunched on his side with the shotgun.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{i was wondering. did any federal people come visit you in jail and i should be watching my ass?}
<A>__{beaumont doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{you wouldn't tell me if they did and i wouldn't blame you.}
<A>__{ordell takes the snubby out of his pants. beaumont quick racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger, and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. he racks it again, click then bam. beaumont is shot hard in the chest. he goes back into he trunk. ordell puts one more shot in his head, bam, tosses the weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk. ordell's beaumont problem is solved. he climbs back into the cab, turns on the engine. we hear the old school r&b song come back on, but very low. ordell drives the olds away.}
