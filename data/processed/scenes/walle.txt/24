<A>__{the back door lowers. a rush of wind and sand. wall e pulls eve inside. closes the door. she coughs up dust. wall e hits a switch... strings of christmas lights fill the space. his racks of oddities painted in colored light. an air of enchantment. eve is taken aback.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[come on in.]}
<A>__{she drifts through the sea of knickknacks. becomes spooked by a singing billy bass fish. threatens to shoot it, but wall e calms her down. he is compelled to show her everything. hands her an eggbeater... ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)... ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)... ...the rubik's cube (she solves it immediately)... ...his hello dolly tape. curious, she begins unspooling the tape.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(loud beeps)}
<D>__{[my tape!!]}
<A>__{he grabs it back. protective. inserts it carefully into the vcr. please still work. the movie eventually appears on the tv. plays a clip of poysc. wall e is relieved.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[what do you think?]}
<A>__{mimics the dancing for eve. encourages her to try. she clumsily hops up and down. makes dents in the floor. rattles everything. wall e politely stops her.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[how `bout we try a different move?]}
<A>__{spins in a circle. arms out. eve copies. spins faster, and faster... too fast. accidentally strikes wall e. he flies into the shelves. eve helps him up from the mess. wall e's left binocular eye falls off. dangles from two wires. eve gasps with concern. wall e placates her.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[it's fine.]}
<A>__{feels his way to the rack of shelves. rotates them until... ...spare wall e parts appear. replaces his broken eye with a new one. eve is relieved. she eyes his lighter collection. flicks open a zippo. ignites a flame. wall e freezes. he had no idea it could do that. moves closer to inspect it... on wall e it's the closest he's ever been to eve. she remains focused on the lighter. wall e stares up at her. ...the tiny flame flickering between them... ...the hello dolly video plays iotam in the background... suddenly, he is moved to express his love. musters the courage to open his fingers... ...timidly reaches his hand out to hers... eve turns and looks at him. wall e instantly chokes. pulls his hand back. eve becomes intrigued with the tv. scans the image of the lovers singing iotam... wall e watches her. his infatuation still palpable. then he remembers...}
<D>__{wall e ee vah!}
<A>__{he rushes to his shelves. eve watches him rummage through junk. a drum falls down on his head. she giggles, charmed by it all. something about wall e... she is drawn back to the lovers on tv... ...then the lit zippo lighter in her hand. a tap on her shoulder. she turns to find wall e holding something. the plant. eve immediately locks onto it. drops the lighter. in a flash... ...her chest opens... ...a tractor beam snatches the plant away... ...stores it inside her... then she shuts down completely. only a single green light pulsing on her chest. wall e is stunned. what'd i do? waves his hand in front of her face.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah?}
<A>__{knocks on her chest plate. no response. wall e panics. gently shakes her.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah?}
<A>__{still no response.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah? ...ee vah?!}
<A>__{camera moves in on the blinking green light...}
