<A>__{the green flourescents of the "emerald city" give a deathly cast to the underground street as diana rounds the corner, and collapses against the wall. her heart pounding like a frightened deer, she has run as far as she can. pompas comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around the corner. they spot her crouched against the wall. she starts to scream but angel grabs her by the collar and pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide eyed with terror as he touches her throat with his knife.}

<D>__{come on, chika. we gonna have some fun. you gonna take us to your father.}
<A>__{we hear a loud metallic click. we see the barrel of a huge revolver. they wheel to see eddie crouched, gun drawn, in the alley entrance.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{pompas, you're getting to be a fucking pain in the ass.}
<A>__{the boys put their hands up, but eddie doesn't see the third, samo, coming up behind him. angel grabs diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts backing up the stairs that lead to the street.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{let her go, pooch.}
<A>__{samo jumps eddie, and the gun goes flying. it hits the pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street. in a staggering blur eddie takes out the comachos, kicking the last one end over end. but angel and the girl have disappeared to the street above. eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps.}
