<L>__{exterior u.n. compound monrovia. day.}
<A>__{a pep rally for the mostly male u.n. peacekeepers. a stage has been erected in the rundown embassy grounds. they chant and stamp their feet impatiently. a u.n. officer, acting as m.c., approaches the microphone.}
<C>__{m.c.}
<P>__{(battling the microphone's feedback)}
<D>__{and now, we have a surprise for you. the 83rd west african peacekeeping corp is proud to present, all the way from el salvador, the newly crowned miss world, ava cordova.}
<A>__{from behind a jerry rigged curtain appears the vision that is ava cordova. she wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her. she is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting. the peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval. yuri, near the front of the stage, is hypnotized. standing closer to yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is captain vivian carlisle (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison with the goddess on stage). she catches yuri's reaction.}
<C>__{u.n. peacekeepers}
<P>__{(chanting to ava)}
<D>__{take it off, baby! take it off!}
<A>__{ava steps up to the microphone.}
<C>__{ava}
<P>__{(referring to the sea of u.n. berets)}
<D>__{baby blue. my favorite color!}
<A>__{a roar of approval from the men.}
<C>__{ava }
<D>__{i suppose i could give you the speech about "my hope for world peace" but i have a feeling you don't want to hear that today.}
<C>__{u.n. peacekeeper}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{my hope is for a piece of your ass!}
<A>__{they roar again.}
<C>__{ava}
<P>__{(laughing it off)}
<D>__{i don't know if you'll be taking me to bed tonight, darling, but you can take her.}
<A>__{ava unfurls a life size poster of herself in a swimsuit, flirtatiously holding it up against her body. she tosses other posters to eager hands.}
<C>__{ava }
<D>__{you're all doing a great job keep it up. enjoy the show!}
<A>__{on stage, a generic looking rock group starts to play a cover from the 80's tears for fears' "shout". ava dances enthusiastically, provocatively. ava appears to make eye contact with yuri blowing a kiss in his direction. he is paralyzed.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{backstage, yuri and other peacekeepers observe ava escorted towards a huge, american car. an inebriated u.n. peacekeeper tries to get her attention.}
<C>__{u.n. peacekeeper}
<D>__{ava! ava!}
<A>__{as the young man reaches out to her, a slick, handsome business manager shoves him aside.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{don't touch what you can't afford.}
<A>__{the manager slips into the car beside ava. the u.n. peacekeeper and yuri watch the car roar away.}
<C>__{u.n. peacekeeper}
<P>__{(regretting indulging the fantasy)}
<D>__{let's get drunk.}
