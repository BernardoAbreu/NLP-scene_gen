<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{my first big claims investigation i really check into it. sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories, he can only remember things for a few minutes.}
<A>__{sammy watches a commercial on t.v. memento pink revisions 9 7 99}
<D>__{leonard (v.0.) (cont'd) he'd watch t.v., but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing, he couldn't remember how it began. he liked commercials. they were short.}
<A>__{sammy rolls a small glass bottle between the palms of his hands. mrs. jankis rolls up her sleeve. leonard watches as sammy takes a syringe and pushes the needle through the rubber of the bottle. the label is marked "insulin".}
<D>__{leonard (v.o.)(cont'd) the crazy part was that this guy who couldn't follow the plot of "green acres" could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before the accident...}
<A>__{sammy inverts the bottle and syringe, draws the insulin into the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for bubbles, tapping it delicately.}
<D>__{leonard (v.0.) (cont'd) ... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.}
<A>__{sammy wipes a spot on mrs. jankis' arm with a swab, then gently pinches the skin and confidently inserts the needle. mrs jankis winces.}
<C>__{mrs jankis}

<A>__{sammy looks up, worried. mrs jankis smiles at him. sammy pushes the plunger, withdraws the needle and presses the swab against the skin, lookinq into mrs jankis' eyes and smiling back.}
