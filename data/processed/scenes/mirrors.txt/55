<L>__{interior night mayflower}
<A>__{night has fallen. the department store is calm and silent. we move down each floor to the entrance hall. the basement door is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the flashlight. ben must be down there. all of a sudden, a loud shriek tears through the silence. there is a woman, somewhere in the store. ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. the shrieks resound through the department store again. they seem to come from one of the floors above. without hesitation, ben dashes up the stairs he arrives on the second floor and searches through all the departments. impossible to tell where the cries originate from. he climbs up to the third floor. the beam of the flashlight sweeps past each nook and dark corner somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail to death.}
