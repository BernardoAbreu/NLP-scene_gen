<A>__{todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of the dresser. he yanks on the drawer. it comes half way out and stops.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{goddamn you, come out.}
<A>__{the drawer flies out, knocking todd back. he digs through it, the contents of dussander's fake lives spilling about the room. he finds the box at the bottom. as he expected, it is locked. without a moment's hesitation, he slams the box down on the post of the bed frame. it doesn't open, but bits of the frame fly across the room. on the third attempt the tiny box shatters. todd freezes, cocks his head. outside he hears the distinct roar and sputter of the porsche engine. he grabs two pages of a letter. there is nothing he can do about the mess in the room. he closes the door on his way back to the kitchen.}
