<A>__{pk finishes setting the charge. he scales down the wall. a large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes bouncing down the sides to the funnel, just missing pk, crashing through the bars below. pk freezes. elijah holds his breath. the crew in the safty tunnel quakes. nothing happens. pk comes down the rest of the way. he takes the cordtex rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse. he nods to elijah. elijah lights a cheesa stick. he hands the glowing stick to pk. pk waves towards the tunnel. one of the africans sounds the warning whistle. two blasts followed by two blasts. pk nods for elijah to be off. elijah stands his ground.}

<D>__{i wait for you, baas.}
<A>__{pk lights the fuse. elijah takes off like a scared rabbit for the safety of the shaft. pk is right on his tail. the fuse travels quickly toward the bomb. elijah trips. pk, coming behind him, grabs him by the collar and flings him into the safety tunnel, diving after him a second later, just as the bomb explodes. a few rocks come down, but nothing else. the africans look at each other with real apprehension. pk rises from elijah and peeks out. his pov hangup is still in place. pk studies the hangup, stepping out onto the grizzly, listening, looking. the hangup groans. the africans are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel. pk stops midway on the bars. he studies the hangup intently, then picks up a rock. choosing a target he heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup and runs like hell. the rock hits the hangup. pk springs off the grizzly, right into the africans as the hangup thunders down. dust and small rocks fill the safety tunnel. when the avalanche has stopped pk raises himself off the africans. they are all covered in dust but smiling and babbling, happy to be alive. pk peeks out and up. he signals to elijah who hits the ll clear whistle. three blasts.}

<D>__{the africans think the longer you survive the luckier you are. and the luckier you are the longer you survive. i know there's something inherently wrong with their logic. still, i'm beginning to see their pointerior especially with less than six months to go.}
