<L>__{exterior marie's apartment morning}
<A>__{the two of them come out of the building and into the street.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{which way are you going?}
<C>__{marie}
<P>__{(points left)}
<D>__{that way. you?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(points right)}
<D>__{that way.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{and so it is. i will talk to you later.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i will call you.}
<C>__{marie}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{right.}
<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{empty. dick prices records out on the floor. rob leans against the register. barry sits on a stool next to him. they're top fiving it. rob's heart isn't in it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay. top five side one track ones. number one... "janie jones," the clash, from the clash.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{ehh.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{"thunder road," bruce springsteen, from born to run. "smells like teen spirit," nirvana, nevermind.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh no, rob, that's not obvious enough. not at all. dick, did you hear that?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{shut up. "let's get it on," marvin gaye, from let's get it on. "airbag," radiohead, from ok computer.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{ooh! a kind of recent record! rob's sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old classics! nice! "let's get it on?" couldn't you make it more obvious than that?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{rob. phone.}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{it's laura.}
<A>__{rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord. deep breath.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{laura intercut}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hi. i've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i'm thinking i didn't take them with me. have you seen them around?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i will look for 'em. how you doing?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm sorry to call, but i need that stuff...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{fine, i'm sure it's in the file at home. i will call you when i find it, and then we'll talk.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{we'll talk some other time.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{great... that's great.}
<A>__{rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{rob! what about the beatles? what about the fucking rolling stones? what about fucking... fucking... beethoven? track one side one of the fifth symphony? you shouldn't be allowed to run a record shop. you shouldn't be allowed to }
<A>__{sfx: barry's voice fades out. rob's mouth slacks and he stares off.}
<C>__{rob }
<D>__{there's something different about the sound of her voice... and what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. yet. what does "yet" mean, anyway? "i haven't seen... evil dead ii yet." what does that mean? it means you're going to go, doesn't it?}
<A>__{sfx: back to the room.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{ you're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ barry, if i were to say to you i haven't seen evil dead ii yet, what would that mean?}
<A>__{barry just looks at rob. he pulls out a game boy and begins playing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{just... come on, what would it mean to you? that sentence? "i haven't seen evil dead ii yet?"}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{to me, it would mean that you're a liar. you saw it twice. once with laura oops once with me and dick. we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off screen in the fourteenth century.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, i know. but say i hadn't seen it and i said to you, "i haven't seen evil dead ii yet," what would you think?}
<A>__{barry shuts off the game boy.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i'd think you were a cinematic idiot. and i'd feel sorry for you.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no, but would you think, from that one sentence. that i was going to see it?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i'm sorry, rob, but i'm struggling here. i don't understand any part of this conversation. you're asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. what am i supposed to say?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{just listen to me. if i said to you }
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{" i haven't seen evil dead ii yet," yeah, yeah, i hear you }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{would you... would you get the impression that i wanted to see it?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...}
<A>__{rob brightens. barry finally considers.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{...but the word "yet..." yeah, you know what, i'd get the impression that you wanted to see it. otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but in your opinion, would i definitely go?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{how the fuck am i supposed to know that? you might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.}
<A>__{rob darkens.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{why would they care?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{because it's a brilliant film. it's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a strange moment.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i never thought i would say this, but can i go work now?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{let's pack it up. we haven't had a customer in four hours.}
<A>__{barry stands.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{fine by me. i still want pay to 7 o'clock.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ha.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i can't go to the club tonight, guys.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{dick smiles sheepishly.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{who are you going to see?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{nobody.}
<A>__{barry's eyes widen.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{rob, looky looky. dick! are you getting some?!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{un fucking believable. dick's out on a hot date, rob's boning marie lasalle, and the best looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{how do you know about that?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh come on, rob. what am i, an idiot? i'm more bothered by dick's thing. how did this happen, dick? what rational explanation can there possibly be? what's her name?}
<A>__{barry is going a little hard. dick shrinks back.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{anna.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{anna who? anna green gables? anna conda?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{anna moss.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{anna moss. mossy. the mossy thing. the swamp thing. is she all green and furry?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{shut the fuck up, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? you two have to stick together now. boners united. united in getting some.}
<A>__{barry picks up his bag and heads for the door.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{don't be sad, barry. you'll find true love someday.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{suck my ass.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{terrific.}
<A>__{rob looks to dick, who looks guilty.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{don't worry about it, dick. barry's an asshole.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yeah... well... i will see you tomorrow, rob.}
<A>__{dick exits. rob watches the door close behind him, and looks out over the empty store. he talks to camera as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{why does it bother barry that much that dick is seeing someone? he's worried about how his life is turning out, and he's lonely, and lonely people are the bitterest of them all.}
<A>__{...until all the lights are out. rob's silhouette slips out the door.}
