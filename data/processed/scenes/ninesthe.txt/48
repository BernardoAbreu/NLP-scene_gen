<A>__{sarah tops off gary's wine glass. they're both on the couch. the baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{... so it's kind of hard to prove that i only meant to burn my ex girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah. fire's tricky that way.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{how about you? any history of arson?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{strangely enough...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i knew it! i could see that little spark.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it wasn't arson. probably.}
<A>__{a long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him the story.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{okay. when i was a little girl, our house caught on fire.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{oh shit. music begins, providing backing to her monologue.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i will never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement. on gary, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at the same time.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{i stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. and when it was all over, i said to myself, "is that all there is to a fire?" is that all there is? as she starts to sing, gary realizes the story isn't hers at all. it's peggy lee's "is that all there is."}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{is that all there is, is that all there is? if that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. she leans closer.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{let's break out the booze and have a ball. if that's all there is. standing up, sarah takes gary's hands, pulling him off the couch. she leads him to an open area more space for dancing.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{is that all there is, is that all there is? if that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. let's break out the booze and have a ball, if that's all there is.}
