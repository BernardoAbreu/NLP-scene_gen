<L>__{interior hotel bathroom night}
<A>__{she looks down toward the floor. she is literally standing in a pool of her own blood. she gasps, turns back toward the mirror. blood is pouring from the wound. gasping, almost crying, amy stumbles back into the main room. with shaky hands, she picks up the phone, then realizes that she's still holding the stiletto in her hand. she drops it on the table. her bloody fingers press in the numbers 9 9 9 (emergency). she waits, standing in the middle of her dark hotel room, shaking, bloody. she can hear the phone ring and ring. finally, there's a click as the line picks up. but there's no voice on the other end.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hello, hello? hello? is there anyb...}
<A>__{then she stops dead. there is somebody there, and making a sound we've heard before. the nasty gurgling that amy heard when she tried calling marla's room.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(through phone)}
<D>__{only he can bring you back.}
<A>__{she slams the phone down, tears the cord from the wall. as she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking. she turns at the sound. pinhead is standing across the room from her, reading from one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{" to all of us there comes the closing of the doors the entrances the exits so that one may pass no more out or in..."}
<A>__{he closes the book, turns toward her.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{walt whitman. i like your taste in books.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{came with the room. along with the uncomfortable couch.}
<A>__{amy puts the phone back on the table.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{who are you? why did you do this to me?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i didn't. believe me, when i want to hurt you, it will be more than a scratch.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{then why the hell are you here? why are you in my room?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this isn't your room. it's mine...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this is my room, my building, my street... my world. you still can't believe that you're in the "real" world, can you? i mean... you've just had a a knife run through you. shouldn't it hurt?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's a dream. i'm dreaming...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no. dreams come to an end. nightmares are forever.}
<A>__{he approaches her. she backs away.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you've been recruited as a soldier in another man's war. a war he will never win, that i can assure you.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you will. soon enough. but one shouldn't worship false gods. especially when that false god is themselves.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm not a believer.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{oh you will. tell me, do you believe in hell?}
<A>__{looks down at the blade jutting out from her chest.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{starting to.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you opened a door. he pulled you in. but the only way out is through me.}
<A>__{he steps towards her. she grabs up the phone, flings it. it hits the far wall and falls to the floor. winter's gone. she reaches a hand behind her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood.}
<B>__{a moment later}
<A>__{we see amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky side up. she presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel attached. she slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the wound. she takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away. she yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans. she tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket. she goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back. she turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood. she hurries to the sink, rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then grabs her bag and heads out the door.}
