<D>__{one more minute...}
<A>__{but here's alice. she slips into her seat.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{he unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...wanna savor this.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's gonna get cold.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{right. wait. a toast.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you're just afraid to eat it.}
<A>__{she smiles, picks up her glass.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{to the artist.}
<A>__{they toast. she sips her wine. he sips his. he wants desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. but she's watching him, waiting for him to eat. he picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. she watches keenly. he brings the food to his mouth, passes it between his lips, swallows. he closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact bracing for a paroxysm. she watches him expectantly either for his verdict on the food, or for the first fatal spasm.}

<P>__{(his voice cracks)}
<D>__{it's great. it's great.}
<A>__{she grins. she takes a bite. the moment she looks away, he turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear. the tracks are still flat, there's no redness. he shovels a large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. then another bite, greedy with life.}
