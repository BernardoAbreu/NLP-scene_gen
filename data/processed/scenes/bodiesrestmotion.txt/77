<A>__{a chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow. the camera tilts down to reveal... mr. august, elizabeth and nick, sitting at a large antique dining room table. nick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in front of him. mr. august and elizabeth watch him, expectantly. nick notices this.}

<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(matter or factly)}
<D>__{did you lose them both at the same time?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{is that like a joke?}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then yes. i lost them both at the same time.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm really sorry.}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i should go.}
<A>__{mr. august slowly stands as elizabeth follows nick toward the foyer.}

<A>__{nick edges toward the door followed by elizabeth and mr. august.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{my mother and i were with him in the hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd grab my arms and hold on.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's very sad...}
<P>__{(after a beat, backing toward the door)}
<D>__{i've really gotta be going. i, uh... thank you again for the sandwich. delicious...}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{have you found your real parents?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no. two are enough to lose.}
<A>__{nick stares at her the sad truth of her statement sinking in.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i'm not alone. i have my grandfather.}
<A>__{nick looks down. he is alone. he has no one.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(opening the door)}
<D>__{listen...}
<A>__{he looks into her eyes. elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm. he stares at her, not knowing what to do. she holds his arm tightly for a moment, then lets go.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she steps back from nick, against her grandfather.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(in explanation)}

<A>__{nick stares at elizabeth.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have to go.}
