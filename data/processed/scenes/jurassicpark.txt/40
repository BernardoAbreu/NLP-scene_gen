<L>__{ext nedry's jeep, back roads }
<A>__{nedry speeds along the rain slick road, fish tailing as he goes. close on nedry at the wheel. nedry's pov the dark, wet road running alongside a ten foot chain link fence. suddenly, a beast like visage blur s across the road. nedry swerves. the jeep skids. nedry tries to over steer, can't bring the careening jeep under control. the jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and dives into a raging gully. nedry curses. he spins the wheel. the tires spin and spray. the jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully. from nedry's seat in the jeep, he cranes his head around, examining his situation. nedry's pov on the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment graveyard. by the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around can be seen discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors. nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end. and wades over to an abandoned tractor.}

<A>__{he loops the winch around the tractor's base. suddenly, he stops and looks around as he hears a gentle hooting. he squints, looking at the strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli ghts. hoot! hoot! a distinctive hooting. nedry looks up in fear. silence. nedry starts moving toward his jeep. again, the hoot! nedry stops, looks right, looks left. a rustle in the trees. nedry's head cocks. looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, nedry sees a spitter in the eerie mist. now it's gone. now it's back. it circles nedry warily, hunting him. nedry stares.}

<A>__{nedry scrambles the other way, full tilt. hop, hop, and the spitter drops in front of nedry from the other side. hoot! nedry jumps back, lands on his butt. the spitter zips in from the side hoot! nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree. he splashes down the embankment, trying to get to his jeep. he uses the winch line to steady himself again the raging current. he finally reaches the jeep, swings open the door and, surging out of the water like a demonic apparition, is the spitter! nedry backs away, directly into the glare of the headlights! close on the spitter. it's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out like an umbrella around its neck. something squirts beneath its jaws. a big glob smacks nedry on the arm. he brushes it off.}
