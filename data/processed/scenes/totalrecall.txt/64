<L>__{interior e.i.o. headquarters memory lab night}
<A>__{opening close on a monitor screen slated "hauser quail" followed by a serial number and some dates. the slate vanishes, replaced by a scene of quail undergoing some kind of military training. pan to other monitors, all depicting quail in other action scenes on some kind of mission, driving a car, etc. technicians man the monitors, scrolling through them in fast forward and fast reverse as if searching files. the technicians turn as cohaagen and his aides enter.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<P>__{(demands)}
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{we're running every one of his memory tapes for the past fifteen years. nothing yet, sir.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{there must be something some place he would go, some friend he would run to.}
<A>__{the red haired e.i.o. man joins them.}
<D>__{red headed man}
<P>__{(to cohaagen; quietly)}
<D>__{they lost him.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{again?!}
<A>__{the red headed man nods.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{are you sure the original suppression took?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{absolutely, sir. he thinks he's quail, a computer...}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{then how do you explain what he's doing?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{just his instincts. he was well trained by e.i.o.... maybe the memory cap's fractured. portions of his prior identity could be leaking through.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<P>__{(very anxious)}
<D>__{he'll remember mars? the sphinx project?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{fragments. nothing more. nothing he could piece together. i did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{what do you think i am? a barbarian? we're not living in the twentieth century!}
<A>__{he looks at the video screen again. an image has flashed onto it of an attractive eurasian girl.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hold it there.}
<A>__{he studies the picture, which changes to show the same girl from different angles.}
