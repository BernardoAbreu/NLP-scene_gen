<L>__{interior. guest bedroom katherine's house evening}
<A>__{a floral bedroom. ester lies in bed, wheezing, semi conscious. katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water. lincoln stands watching. katherine ushers him out of the room.}
<L>__{interior. kitchen continuous}
<A>__{the kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with paintings and craftwork. a r t marginally overwhelming science. katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what did you give her?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{j u s t something to help her sleep. i think she has a bronchial infection. but i'm not sure i should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{s o you know about the baby...}
<A>__{katherine pauses, reality sinking its claws. she looks at him }
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{is n ' t that why you came here?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i found your name in the listings. i wasn't sure. you don't look like her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{the y have a plan... for women like me.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{s o you're the one who takes her baby.}
<A>__{katherine winces at him. it's uttered so matter of factly. she pauses, hanging her head, searching within herself.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you know when you're young? how you run around thinking you're immortal?}
<A>__{lincoln ' s look says he has no idea. she seems not to notice.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{the r e was a lodeway accident. i was... damaged. after that, i thought no man would ever want me. i was wrong. his name was john. he said he married me for my eyes. ocean eyes, he called them. he always loved the ocean. up there on the wall, that's john's boat.}
<A>__{o f f her gesture, lincoln glances at the wall. a watercolor of a yacht. meaningless to him but katherine gazes it at, fondly }
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{but i think there was always an unspoken regret between us. when we heard about the technology, it was like... forgive n e s s , like a second chance. a child of our own, part of both of us. sailing trips, fishing trips, so many plans...}
<P>__{( a flat beat)}
<D>__{j o h n got cancer a year ago. he died.}
<A>__{he r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i r o n i c . that the same technology could have saved his life. and now the baby is the only part of him i have left. and the boat. i still have the boat.}
<A>__{lincoln looks discomfited. there's more to this than he thought.}
