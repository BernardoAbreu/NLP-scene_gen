<A>__{fired. his eye closes. on danny his mouth opens to scream but nothing comes out. and with that it is all over. danny tries to get to his feet again. fails, his eyes flutter. all is silent except for a faint liquid spattering. long shot back on the salton sea, placid and silvered with moonlight.}
