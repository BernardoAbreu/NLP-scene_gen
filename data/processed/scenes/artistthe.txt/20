<D>__{they're about to start shooting. the director is showing george what he has to do. the scene is happening in a cabaret restaurant. george has to cross a dance floor, but each time he is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to change dancing partner. george finds himself dancing with peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next, the director finds the gag hysterical. the scene is shot several times from three different angles. each time, george dances with peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes. to begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so. then they become embarrassed, and then things get worse. we start the sequence again and again, to the sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. ultimately, no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing. it's probably love.}
