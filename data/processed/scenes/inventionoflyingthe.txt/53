<L>__{interior lecture films writer's offices day}
<A>__{mark walks the aisles of lecture films. people stop to stare at him. there is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices. mark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the door: "14th century closed." mark grimaces and keeps walking.}
<C>__{shelley }
<D>__{he's gone crazy!}
<A>__{mark turns his head to see shelley, standing down the hall, terrified, staring at mark. mark ignores her and keeps walking. leaning against his door jamb, is rob, smirking as mark passes him.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{come to beg for your old job back? hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the black plague would make for an interesting film. good luck, douche bag. freaking loser.}
<A>__{mark walks right up to the door that reads, "head of development anthony james." mark opens the door. anthony is on the phone, his back to mark.}
<C>__{anthony }
<D>__{they're going to fire me any moment, i just know it. i'm really, really horrible at my job. i don't know anything about movies. i don't even like movies. i like sports. head of development, what does that even mean? i'm not a smart person. okay, talk to you later.}
<A>__{anthony turns around to find mark. his face becomes very, very scared.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that was the head of the studio.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm not mad at all.}
<A>__{anthony is relieved.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{oh good, because i feel really bad about it. i mean, i would be horrible at your job too. i would be horrible at any job in this place.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i love sports.}
<A>__{they both stare at each other for a long beat.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<A>__{mark pulls up a chair.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when you fired me, i was very depressed.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and so i left this building and i just started walking. and i walked all the way out of town. and then i walked into the desert and i fell asleep under a tree.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i don't do well with other people's life changing events.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and when i woke up i found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground. so i started digging. and i unearthed a very old and ancient box. probably, oh... about... seven hundred years old. and inside the box...}
<P>__{(holding up manuscript)}
<D>__{... was this.}
<A>__{mark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on anthony's desk. anthony is scared to touch it.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's a never before heard historical event from the past.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{when does it take place?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the 1300's.}
<A>__{the excitement drains from anthony's face.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i told you we're not interested in black plague movies here, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this one isn't about the black plague. well it isn't just about the black plague. let me read you some of this.}
<A>__{anthony rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{anthony, get excited about this. this is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before. it's a great human discovery.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yeah, but is there a movie there?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the greatest movie lecture films has ever made.}
<A>__{anthony's eyes widen.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{start reading.}
<A>__{mark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{on the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. it began as a day much like any other. the sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry. but all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of babylon.}
<A>__{anthony's mouth drops to the ground.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{mark smiles. anthony picks up his phone and presses "intercom".}
<C>__{anthony }
<D>__{i want everyone in here now! we've got a big one.}
<A>__{anthony hangs up.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{please, mark. continue.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{as the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women.}
