<L>__{exterior street myers house night}
<A>__{kara bolts out of the blankenship house and races across the street, chasing after danny through rain and lightning.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny, no!!!}
<A>__{kara's p.o.v. following danny he glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the myers house. disappearing inside.}
<B>__{kara}
<A>__{shoots across the lawn. up the porch steps. right behind him.}
<L>__{interior myers house foyer}
<A>__{kara dives through the front door. thunder shatters the house. everything is frighteningly dark. shockingly quiet. inch by inch, she makes her way inside. eyes wide. savage. shaking uncontrollably. a crashing sound behind her. she jumps out of her skin. just the door slamming shut in the wind.}
<C>__{kara}
<P>__{(the faintest whisper)}
<D>__{danny?}
<A>__{she advances into the hall. old floorboards creak beneath her feet. sounds up ahead. footsteps. kara looks up. lightning flashes. danny is nearing the top of the stairs! instinct propels her up the stairs after him. then suddenly she stops dead. reason taking over. and she turns back. picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner. then she heads back up the stairs. mind blown with horror.}
<B>__{upstairs hallway}
<A>__{kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway. summoning all of her courage, she moves forward. suddenly danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside his bedroom a fleeting, ghostly image. kara startles. follows him inside. danny's bedroom danny stands in a corner. lightning illuminates his toy dinosaurs. kara goes to him, takes his hand. he resists her.}
<C>__{kara}
<P>__{(intense whisper)}
<D>__{come on ... danny, please.}
<A>__{she picks him up, carries him toward the door. lumbering footsteps. kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the shape stalks down the hall. eyes probing. walking right past them. danny's bedroom kara slips silently back into the room, carrying danny through the bathroom. adjoining on the opposite side into kara's room lightning crackles. the walls are covered with blood. kara stumbles over something on the floor. cranes her neck to look down. beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet. shock waves send kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door. hanging on a hook is tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a horrified rictus of death. kara screams. drops danny. quickly covers her mouth. realizing that she's given them away. suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges. the shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny, run!!!}
<A>__{danny ducks into the hall, evading the shape's lurching hands.}
<B>__{danny}
<A>__{careens down the stairs. thunder rages.}
<B>__{kara}
<A>__{brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer. the shape moves in, backing her through the bathroom ... into danny's room. suddenly she slams the door on the shape. kara tears off into the hallway. turns. waiting for the shape to appear. it doesn't. kara vacillates down the hall. jumping at every sound. training her weapon at things unseen. slamming doors along the way, sealing off every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable dark tunnel. suddenly something crashes down from above. kara's mother, strung up on a bloody sheet, dangling upside down from the trap door in the ceiling! the axe still protruding from her chest.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{kara screams, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through the blackened doorway behind her. an unbearable moment of tension as we think the shape's mask will be there. suddenly the shape shoots up directly in front of her! tearing the dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from debra's chest with a repulsive squish. kara wheels toward the stairs. the shape advances. swings the axe. misses her by inches. kara ducks, lurches behind the shape. swings the fireplace poker with everything she's got. cracking it full force over the back of the shape's head. the shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, slamming hard onto the floor below. terrified, kara chances a look down. the shape doesn't move.}
