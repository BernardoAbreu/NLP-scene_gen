<A>__{brian and jennifer are having the time of their lives, when suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a stretcher to an ambulance and brian sees sweet jesus it's tim. jennifer turns away in horror. they load tim into the van as adcox and grindle jump in to ride along. to hold his hand. stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat and slams it to the ground. he kicks it, kicks it till his strength's gone. he turns, his wounded eyes finding brian.}
