<L>__{interior jail day}
<A>__{kabuo sits in jailhouse overalls on the edge of his cot. motion less. on a private journey of the mind. the door clangs open...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{this here is nels gudmundsson, he's your attorney.}
<A>__{kabuo looks over. that flat, unsmiling gaze. the old man has a folded chessboard and a havana cigar box under his arm. their eyes lock, as if the sheriff weren't even here. and moran leaves, closing the door with respectful quiet. nels doesn't smile, doesn't speak. opens the chessboard on the cot. opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces, two cigars, a snickers and a baby ruth. he puts the candy bars by kabuo's pillow, a silent gift. begins to set up the chessboard.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{what makes you think i play?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your daddy played. i asked, down at the japanese community center. you smoke cigars?}
<A>__{and offers one up, rough and black.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i'm not sure. i better check down at the center.}
<A>__{kabuo smiles only with his eyes. nels nods, maybe you better. lights his own cigar. puts the matches and the other cigar at kabuo's side.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{white or black?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you mean, do i like to take the offensive? or hang back and wait.}
<A>__{that seems answer enough for nels. he turns the board around to where he has white, and makes the first move.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{nice. when two fellas understand each other.}
<A>__{kabuo picks up the cigar. strikes a match.}
<B>__{...........................................................}
<A>__{white. kabuo moves a black bishop. nels' eyes shoot around the table. he reaches and knocks over kabuo's black king. kabuo blinks, studies the board silently. then smiles. he unwraps the snickers bar. breaks it in half. hands one piece across to his lawyer.}
<B>__{series of angles...}
<A>__{rapid cuts, different days, nels in different suits, chess pieces in different positions, each time nels reaching to topple kabuo's king. the last time... kabuo has to study the board for a beat. shakes his head.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you must think i like losing.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i think you like learning.}
<A>__{and leans his old bones back against the hard wall.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{me, too. that's why i come.}
<A>__{pulls out two cigars. kabuo looks at them.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{bet there's a few things you could teach me. kendo, for one.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{sure. i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. right above your left ear.}
<A>__{no smile. steady gaze.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you wouldn't even see it move.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you're wonderin'...how come i never ask. if you did it.}
<A>__{hands one cigar. across the chessboard.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now, you've told me you killed four men. in germany. so i know you are the kind of man who can kill. when there's a reason.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{guess i am.}
<A>__{takes the cigar. rolls it between his thumb and forefinger.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you feel guilty. that you took their lives. that's in your eyes.}
<A>__{strikes a match.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{jury sees what i see. more often than not.}
<A>__{reaches stiffly. kabuo bends toward him. accepts the flame. takes a puff.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{prosecutor thinks. what was your reason? to kill carl heine.}
<A>__{kabuo says not a word.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, there is the land itself. raise your children where you were raised. sleep with your wife at night, 'stead of bein' alone on the sea.}
<A>__{brings the match to his own cigar. careful. expert.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{there's fairness and honor. you were cheated by that old bitch. boy, she is something.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{she's not alone.}
<A>__{worlds within those words.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{none of us are.}
<A>__{and in those.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and prejudice, like you say. your people locked in a concentration camp. you go off to fight for our country's freedom. come back to this.}
<A>__{shakes his head.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but mr. hooks has missed the one reason. one reason. you coulda done it.}
<A>__{a flicker. behind the defendant's eyes.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i read you etta heine's deposition. so i could watch your mind. like i do when you move your rook, or when i move mine.}
<A>__{a smile now. very kind. very sad.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and you weren't thinking about her. or about land. or about you.}
<A>__{no, you weren't. and in the gentlest voice...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no, someone cheats you, you can rise above that. you're a family man. you put them ahead of you, hmmn?}
<A>__{he sighs. but...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{wasn't you she dishonored.}
<A>__{and the old watering eyes are rock steady now.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your father was a strong and tireless man. honest to a fault. kind, and humble as well...}
<A>__{there is a silence. and then...}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{nice. when two fellas. understand each other.}
<A>__{they let that sit.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. and at you with the oth...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{mr. gudmundsson, we know what that jury is looking at.}
<A>__{he won't let hs eyes lie to this man.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your father needs you. to return to your family.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so every time you think about showing that jury strength. or honor or composure. or dignity.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i should show them an american?}
<A>__{nels sees the rage. it breaks his heart. it makes him feel old and helpless.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{show them an innocent man.}
<A>__{what he stares at now. is a neutral mask. as powerful and opaque as the voice is quiet.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{shame you couldn't play chess with my dad, sir. he'd kick your ass.}
