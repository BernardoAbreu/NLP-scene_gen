<L>__{exterior residential street day}
<A>__{robby and sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with a sign marked "pogue construction." sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job. this is her brother, larry pogue, 29. they are not comfortable with each other an old wound. he gives her a wary nod. she's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly. we can sense the strain.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i didn't see his truck, so...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's not here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<A>__{she touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly gesture, a reaching out. he doesn't respond, only shrugs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{kathy and the boy? bet he's big now.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{growin' fast.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is he looking more like you now or did he get lucky?}
<A>__{she has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief, wry smile.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's got kathy's looks and brains and my strong back. you should feel his grip.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you just passing by?}
<A>__{she looks about.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{place is coming along nice. the octagon window. dad's signature.}
<A>__{but larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her mind.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{look, larry, i shouldn't have to hear it from mrs. vander about what's happening.}
<A>__{he turns back to his work now as they speak, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{so you really weren't going to tell me? nobody was going to tell me? mom and dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. mrs. vander is all excited. she bought a new dress. it's blue.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{we're workin' on dad. we think you should be there. we told him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{mom told him?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{we mentioned it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he's holding out, hah?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you want to come?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's my family. jesus, lar. it's over ten years, and he won't let go of it.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you two were always head to head.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{for good reason. remember?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{let's just leave it.}
<A>__{she stares, then...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you're still scared of him.}
<A>__{pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. people see it, they think we're in trouble here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{nice seeing you, too.}
<A>__{she walks away. he frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work.}
<B>__{on street}
<A>__{as sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to robby and calls out...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{two more minutes.}
<A>__{and she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now.}
