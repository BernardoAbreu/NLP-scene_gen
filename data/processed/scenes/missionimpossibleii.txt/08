<L>__{int master bedroom (eve)}
<A>__{nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.}
<L>__{int bath (eve)}
<A>__{a decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored walls. the tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice. nyah can't resist. she spoons a dollop of the caviar and downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to its back. there, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, revealing an electronic density meter. she turns it on and holds it at the rear of the tub. its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(her fondest hopes confirmed)}
<D>__{mmmm.}
<A>__{she now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the tiles just above the sop dish. her knee eyes search for any cracks in the grout and she spots one. using a tweezers she pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles. she slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish. there's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble casing out from the rear of the tub. nyah breathes a sigh of relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself looking down at an open safe, revealing some half dozen locked compartments. as she studies them:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{decisions, decisions.}
<A>__{nyah looks up to see ethan's reflection in the bathroom mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{think you're the only one who can pick a lock?}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(not altogether pleased)}
<D>__{i see. you're not just another pretty face..}
<A>__{before ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the bedroom warbling granada in spanish, and with considerable gusto.}
<C>__{nyah }
<D>__{oh god. a bloody baritone.}
<A>__{nyah catches a reflection behind ethan's in the bathroom mirror. she reaches up and grabs ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the tub, pulling him down on top of her. once again they're nose to nose.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i take it you prefer tenors.}
<A>__{she glances up at the mirror. in it is the reflection of senor augusto de l'arena, a big amiable castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it. he breaks into a heavily accented version of 'now or never', and disappears from the dressing room mirror.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{would you mind if i'm on top?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh, either way works for me.}
<A>__{with a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of ethan and begins working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara brush. she glances down and is rather disconcerted. continues working with the pick and wrench.}
<C>__{ethan's voice}
<D>__{you're never gonna find it there.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)}
<D>__{damn it! find what?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{his ex wife's bulgari necklace that goes up for auction tuesday.}
<A>__{looking down to ethan, a touch of indignation:}
<B>__{looking up}
<A>__{more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from nyah's lower pelvic region as she straddles him. not exactly in the mood to move: she stiffens he knows too damn much.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{ right..where is it?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{far right.}
<A>__{she immediately switches her efforts from top left to the bottom right compartment. she's utterly nonplussed:}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{where's the bloody }
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(plucking it off his chest,}
<D>__{offering it up like a mechanic}
<P>__{under the chassis)}
<D>__{ torque wrench.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{ this is very disconerting..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{hey, you put me here. i just do what i'm told.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{ right..}
<A>__{she unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque wrench and carbide pick and it's open. she withdraws a velvet pouch and opens the pouch. out spills the spectacular necklace.}
<C>__{nyah }
<D>__{lovely.}
<P>__{(starting to close the safe)}
<D>__{who are you and what's it going to cost me?}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(having sat up)}
<D>__{i wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{the alarm goes off.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that.}
<A>__{the bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn senor de l'arena, looking highly upset, pops in.}
<C>__{senor de l'arena}
<D>__{oh, senor keyes, thank god it is you!}
<P>__{(in spanish to security guards, annoyed)}
<D>__{it's senor keyes, the security engineer.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well, senor de l'arena the goods news is that the heat sensors were activated. but miss nordoff hall, my associate }
<A>__{senor de l'arena kisses nyah's hand.}
<C>__{senor de l'arena}
<D>__{mucho gusto, senorita.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{ did feel that she had rather too long to work on the safe before they triggered the alarm, isn't that right miss hall?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{oh yes. absolutely. much too long i should yes.}
<A>__{nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary, intensified curiosity about ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{under the circumstances i think we would recommend re setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. how do you feel about forty kilos, miss hall?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{indeed.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well, senor de l'arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. shall we?}
<A>__{he offers nyah his arm. they start out. ethan immediately stops.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{miss hall. haven't you forgotten something?}
<A>__{nyah looking genuinely puzzled.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{the necklace?}
<A>__{nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.}
<C>__{senor de l'arena}
<P>__{(a great kidder)}
<D>__{what are you trying to do, senorita? rob me.}
<A>__{they all laugh, and ethan's got her out the door.}
