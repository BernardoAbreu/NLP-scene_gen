<A>__{pitch black. an overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man frank carter. he is lying in a coffin. his eyes are closed, his skin made up, like porcelain. carter stands over the coffin. he gently touches his brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. he exits, turning out the light and closing the door. darkness returns.}
