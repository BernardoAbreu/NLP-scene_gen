<L>__{interior dining room continuous}
<A>__{a party in progress, dinner already served. seated around a large square table are: ellen (58, robert's wife), brooke (28, robert's daughter), peter (31, robert's son), tom (brooke's boyfriend), anne (peter's wife), and}
<B>__{three grandchildren.}

<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(lighting up)}
<D>__{look, your grandfather's here!}
<A>__{the kids clamor for robert's attention. he moves around the table, hugging them all.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{hi, guys! goldenrod 4.17.11 5.}
<C>__{grandchild}
<D>__{hi grampi! what did you bring us?}
<A>__{robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a frenzy. he continues making the rounds until he finally gets to brooke and peter, seated next to each other. they embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast to his behavior towards their kids.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{it's your birthday, dad, not theirs. you're spoiling them rotten.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{it's my job! it's my job. you guys turned out fine!}
<C>__{brooke}
<P>__{(half smile)}
<D>__{debatable.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(to peter, as they hug and smile)}
<D>__{how you doin', son? good?}
<A>__{robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to ellen as she discreetly waves to the servants.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{we had to eat. the kids were starving...}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(hugging her, happy)}
<D>__{no, no that's okay. where's my drink, is this mine, here?}
<A>__{another servant enters with a cake flickering birthday candles. everyone notices and starts clapping.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{hey! happy birthday! yay!}
<A>__{robert smiles. they finish cheering, then clink glasses for a toast.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, i didn't even know it was my birthday!}
<A>__{everyone laughs a little.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 6.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{what did mark twain say about? he said old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. if you don't mind, it doesn't matter.}
<P>__{(more laughter)}
<D>__{i've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around at all these shining, radiant faces, i know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... i'm deeply proud of all of you. that's the best gift your mother and i could have hoped for,}
<P>__{(kisses ellen)}
<D>__{so, thank you...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{...and to have sold the company to standard this morning!}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that, too, peter, but no business tonight no business!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{oh, here we go!}
<A>__{more group laughter.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{although your one track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too!}
<A>__{more laughter. robert laughs, too. he sees ellen hug peter across the room.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{now, i'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important and it's you guys so thank you all very much.}
<C>__{all}
<P>__{(as they applaud)}
<D>__{hear, hear! goldenrod 4.17.11 7.}
