<L>__{exterior alley behind cobo hall night}
<A>__{lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff of his neck. the security officers laugh and pat themselves on the back as they hurry back in. lex peeks out the lid. the alley is dark and spooky. he jumps out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest german shepherd that has ever lived. its teeth are bared and its black, wolf like body is coiled, ready to spring. grrrrrrr! lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. a growling pitbull walks out from the shadows and joins the shepherd.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(petrified)}
<D>__{dogs! why did it have to be dogs!}
<A>__{then, a growling doberman with a spiked collar emerges from the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, muscular form making the brick building nearby look like jello. lex starts slapping himself on the face.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{wake up, lex! wake up, man! this part's gotta be a nightmare!}
<A>__{no luck. he stops, when several other dogs emerge from the shadows and gather behind the first three. these new mutts immediately join in the growling chorale. the shepherd snaps at lex.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(to the heavens)}
<D>__{god, if you ever get me outta this, i swear i will never masturbate again!}
<A>__{the pack barks even louder.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(to heaven again)}
<D>__{i really mean it this time!}
