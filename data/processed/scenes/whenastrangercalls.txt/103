<L>__{exterior alleyway night the present}
<A>__{at first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black screen. the previous sound of a boy crying increases. then the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire screen image moves toward normal definition. finally, we know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that the white blur is actually a little boy lost, sobbing uncontrollably. closeup duncan awakening to the scene, coming back to reality. he is confused.}
<B>__{wider angle on duncan and boy}
<A>__{the boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles. duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child, staring at it with a strange look on his face. suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at duncan quizzically, hesitantly. they are less than a foot apart, almost face to face. together they form a kind of frozen tableau. something close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition. then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway. duncan watches him disappear. then he slowly pulls himself to his feet.}
