<L>__{interior restroom night}
<A>__{harry is pulling yusif to his feet when the door bangs open behind him. he turns, thinking it is gib. it's not. malik raises a full auto beretta 92 f and opens fire. harry spins yusif between him and the machine pistol. yusif's beer keg body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting harry long enough for him to dive into a stall. malik hoses the room with the beretta. the metal stalls are riddled with hits. harry is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting there. the walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on the far side. harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his glock. malik goes empty. harry hears that and pops out, cranking off rounds malik is a blur going out the door, as harry's shots shatter tiles on the doorframe. then silence.}
