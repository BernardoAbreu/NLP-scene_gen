<L>__{interior brody house night}
<A>__{ellen is working at her desk in the den. she is looking towards the door, expectantly it's been an unusually long pause between car arrival and husband arrival. brody enters.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{hi. i closed a sale today, without len. that's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{sean's asleep.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's great too. gorgeous.}
<A>__{he takes a long look at her.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you look about 22 years old sitting there. like you were doing homework...}
<A>__{he goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly lit room. ellen has a beer and sandwich half finished on her desk; brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(sensitive)}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{ooohh, nothing. i just got fired, that's all.}
<A>__{he tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what'd i say?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{that you were fired.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{then that's what i meant. fired. canned. out on my fanny. the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police. just like that.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{because of today? the beach?}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(expansively)}
<D>__{no sweat. a blessing in disguise. back to the city, you can go to bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? me, surrounded by water... ridiculous.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{stop that! we're not going any place. you love it here. tell me what the hell happened!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn shark, big as life. they didn't see it. not like me. not like the poor son of a bitch who snapped this li'l picture... he's out there, somewhere... i shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(studying the photo)}
<D>__{honey, this is nothing... i don't know what it is. what did they...}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(going on)}
<D>__{...everybody wants the job. no one wants the authority. except hendricks. fine. he can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. call me in new york... tell him to kiss my ass...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(seeing his pain)}
<D>__{they have no right to treat you like that. you've given them everything. for four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{fired me!}
<P>__{(at ellen)}
<D>__{i'm not a hysterical man. i'm responsible. i know what i saw...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i know you did...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i try. goddamnit, i tried... now, i'm tired... i can't keep fighting it... i'm too tired... i'm... i'm...}
<A>__{brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally overcome him. he slumps in ellen's arms.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you're drunk is what you are...}
<A>__{she eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his inert shape.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{take it easy... easy...}
<B>__{angle on the stairwell}
<A>__{sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{is dad home? i heard something...}
<A>__{he comes into the darkened den.}
<B>__{ellen and sean}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{shhhh. go back upstairs. daddy's sleeping.}
<A>__{sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{nothing, sweetheart. seaweed.}
<A>__{she takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room, leaving brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.}
