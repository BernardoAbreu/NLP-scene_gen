<L>__{interior police station afternoon}
<A>__{corey signs her statement on officer o'dell's desk, the expression of shock still glued to her face. o'dell sits facing her.}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{you're sure you didn't see a driver?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{he takes the statement from her.}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{well, you're one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did. front passenger side was wiped right out. coulda' been two dead girls today instead of one.}
<A>__{corey nods, taking this in.}
<C>__{officer o'dell }
<D>__{i talked to randy and sent him home a little while ago. he's pretty shook up.}
<A>__{corey doesn't respond. o'dell leans in to speak to her in confidence.}
<C>__{officer o'dell }
<D>__{both of us know he'd been doin' some drinkin' today. but we also know he's not at fault here. that old beater cut right in front him.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{can't you just look up the license plates?}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{no plates on the vehicle. we're investigating the vin, but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership. we'll find him.}
<A>__{corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{what about the missing boy?}
<A>__{o'dell shifts in his chair.}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{you really think it was him, huh?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{he was on the side of the road right before the accident.}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{i'm no psychiatrist, but i do know sometimes shock does funny things...}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{you think i was hallucinating?}
<C>__{officer o'dell}
<D>__{we were on the scene five minutes after the accident. i think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around.}
<A>__{he sees how troubled corey is.}
<C>__{officer o'dell }
<D>__{why don't you stop in and see dr. peters on your way out... right down the hall there. she'll give you somethin' to make you feel better.}
<A>__{corey nods and gets up to leave. as she's on her way out, o'dell's voice stops her.}
<C>__{officer o'dell }
<D>__{oh, uh... is there anything you wanted to say to samantha's parents?}
<A>__{corey's expression is blank.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{like what?}
