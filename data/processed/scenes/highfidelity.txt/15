<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{in almost darkness. more light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record release posters taped to them. a dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug. on the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of jah wobble and glen glenn and other people you've never heard of. but as rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.}

<D>__{the fetish properties are not unlike porn. i would feel guilty taking their money if i wasn't, kind of, well, one of them.}
<A>__{as he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a cd from the sea and replaces it almost the same position, but not quite meticulousness and pride in this gesture... after a moment the door creaks open behind rob, admitting dick, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a sonic youth t shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.}
