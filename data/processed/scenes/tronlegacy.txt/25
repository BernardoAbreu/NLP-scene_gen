<L>__{interior encom corporation conference room day}
<A>__{crisis management team assembles. nervous x net senior staff. rush arrives late, out of breath, determined. joins phlegman and kelter.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{system is stable again, keep you fingers crossed.}
<C>__{phlegman}
<D>__{any luck finding the intruder?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{rush notices across the room: brilliant, beautiful megan randall, his age. her security id: "level black".}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{what's she doing here? this is an operations meeting.}
<C>__{kelter}
<D>__{you and meg still, eh... at it?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{there was never anything between us.}
<A>__{kelter and phlegman trade a look. sure.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{she's advanced projects. this has nothing to do with her.}
<A>__{sinclair storms in. room falls silent.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{this company's existence depends on the flawless launch of x net in twenty two hours, fifty one minutes. now somebody some hacker, some competitor, somebody just proved they're smarter than us. breaking into x net is theoretically impossible.}
<A>__{everybody looks at rush.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{this creep's the best i've ever seen. he crosses platforms, cracks 128 bit encryption, cloaks every move, never leaves a trace.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{when you find him, i will be sure to hire him.}
<A>__{chuckles around the room. mood chills: sinclair's not laughing.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{boys and girls, we cannot sell a secure network that is not secure.}
<C>__{pr vp}
<D>__{we delay the launch.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{and the world assumes we've got a faulty product. and they'd be right.}
<C>__{kelter}
<D>__{we ramp up our encryption schemes }
<C>__{phlegman}
<D>__{thicken all firewalls }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we can't win playing defense. and it's a bigger job than just swatting an intruder program. somewhere, there's a human mind behind this thing. we have to get to that user and shut him or her down, or the game never ends.}
<A>__{meg listens quietly. studies rush.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{what do you need, rush?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{20 guys for 20 days }
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{we don't have 20 hours. this problem needs to be gone before tomorrow 9am. come on people, this company's future is at stake! it's time to think without a box!}
<A>__{minds ponder grimly. finally, a lone vp rises. it's rudy, the company archivist.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{at a time like this, let's seek inspiration in the past. we should ask ourselves: what solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader, flynn.}
<A>__{he's got an obituary photo of flynn, encom's legendary previous and deceased ceo. groans around the table. execs rolls their eyes, disses rudy's idea. flynn has become a stale company joke. rudy sheepishly sits. but sinclair stops behind rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of flynn. an idea takes hold. he looks to meg.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{is the qf 401 is operational?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{um... midway into phase one testing.}
<A>__{confusion among execs. nobody knows what a "qf 401" is. not even rush.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{if we can't fight this intruder from the outside, then maybe we need to fight him from the inside.}
<A>__{meg's mind races.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i'm ready to do my part.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{this company needs a hero. who among you is the smartest, most resourceful and courageous?}

<D>__{who else could it be?}
<A>__{she's singled out rush.}
