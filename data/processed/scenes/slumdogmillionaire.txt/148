<C>__{latika}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{jamal, jamal, look at you...!}
<A>__{their heads are close, they might kiss. then latika turns away, stares out of the window.}
<C>__{latika }
<D>__{are wa, jamal....}
<A>__{jamal smiles hopefully at her. but there is sadness in her now. she takes her sunglasses off, rubs her eyes. there is a bruise there.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you've hurt your eye.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{to see you.}

<D>__{well. you see me.}
<A>__{she stands there, challenging. on the tv, somebody is winning money.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{why does everyone love this programme?}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{it's the chance to escape, isn't it? walk into another life. doesn't everyone want that?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you have another life. a rich one.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{who'd have thought it possible? a slum dog, with all this.}

<D>__{are you happy?}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{i have five star food, five star clothes. i sleep in a bed, not on the street. from where we come from, jamal, that is happiness.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you don't look so happy with a black eye.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{you turn up here out of nowhere, telling me i'm not happy: how dare you?}
<A>__{voices at the gate house.}
<C>__{latika }
<D>__{god, javed will kill you. here.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{javed? you are with him?}

<C>__{javed}
<D>__{first you want a dishwasher, now a bloody cook }
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{ i just thought }
<C>__{javed}
<D>__{ chup. the cricket's on.}
<A>__{javed changes channel and dials on his mobile.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{why do you always watch that shit? huh? i'm already a millionaire.}
<A>__{he laughs at his own joke. turns to jamal.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{well, come on then, cook. i'm hungry. get me a sandwich.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{immediately, sir.}
<A>__{javed stares at jamal a moment, trying to place a face he vaguely recognises. then the bookie comes on the line and he turns back to the television.}
<C>__{javed}
<D>__{atcha...}
<A>__{latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and condiments, whispering while javed talks on the phone.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{come away with me.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{chutiye. away where? and live on what? what can you provide? what have you got, jamal?}

<P>__{(on the mobile)}
<D>__{..yeah. he's on eighty five. i want four lakh on him making a century. what are you giving?...okay, make it five lakh.}
<A>__{javed pours himself a glass of whisky, never taking his eyes from the television.}
<C>__{tv commentator}
<D>__{we are watching history unfold today at the wankhede stadium as sachin tendulkar carves his way towards another magnificent century and the record books. his thirty eighth century the most by any indian cricketer ever...}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{love. that will feed us, will it?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{it won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{where have you been? get in the real world, jamal.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you and me. that is the real world. come away with me.}
<A>__{latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to javed. goes back to jamal, whispers under cover of putting condiments away.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{salim will help us.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{salim? you still believe in salim? jamal...i will be gone soon, anyway. bombay's got too dangerous for }
<A>__{she indicates javed.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{you think he'd tell me?}
<C>__{javed}
<D>__{straight bat, straight bat, dammit.}
<A>__{then the batsman at the other end calls to take a second run.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{no! a single!}
<A>__{tendulkar seems to agree, tries to halt the other batsman with a shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down the wicket. a fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. the bails fly off.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{no, no, no! stupid ben chod idiot...}
<A>__{he flings his glass of whisky at the television. suddenly tastes what he has been eating.}
<C>__{javed }
<D>__{and what is this shit supposed to be, mader chod? get out. get out!}
<A>__{javed throws the sandwich at him and slams out of the room. his footsteps can be heard stomping into another room.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{now go, before he kills us both.}
<A>__{she leads jamal to the door.}
<C>__{javed}
<D>__{latika, where's my bloody shirt? the armani.}
<A>__{latika shouts over her shoulder.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{coming!}
<A>__{back to jamal.}
<C>__{latika }
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{you want to do something for me?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{then forget me.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i will wait at vt station. five o'clock every day until you come.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{so what, jamal? so what?}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{now, get out and tell your no good agency not to send anybody else until they've learnt to cook. you hear?}
<A>__{she slams the door. hurries back into the kitchen, throws javed's plate into the sink. the door keeper comes in.}
<D>__{door keeper madam, your dishwasher has arrived.}
<A>__{leaning over the sink, latika weeps silently.}
