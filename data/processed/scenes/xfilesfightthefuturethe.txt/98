<A>__{overhead angle over the technicians as the creature slams into bronschweig, knocking him out of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole. there are screams of pain from bronschweig, then they abate.}
<B>__{resume interior ice cave}
<A>__{bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. he is in the shadows himself now. trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do this, teetering back into the light we see that he is bloodied. he is hurt, injured. making his way back toward the patch of light that comes from the hole above. hoping to see that help is on its way, while keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows, for another attack by the creature.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{hey i need help.}
<A>__{but the technicians looking down on him offer him nothing of the sort. all they do is quickly close the clear hatch that seals bronschweig inside the cave.}
<C>__{dr. bronschweig}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{but he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. a moment later the first bobcat shovel full of dirt falls onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light. they are burying bronschweig alive.}
