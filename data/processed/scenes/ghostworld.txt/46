<L>__{interior the coffee experience late afternoon}
<A>__{rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of yuppies. we can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "answer today's trivia question and get a free small coffee".}

<A>__{enid is in the way. she reads it to him.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{"where on the human body is the 'douglas pouch' located?"}
<A>__{feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. a digital graphic of the female form on his computer screen. with a few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the reproductive system. an area behind the cervix blinks.}
<C>__{feldman}
<D>__{slightly below the uterus on a female.}
<A>__{he takes his coffee and putters towards the door.}
<C>__{enid}

<D>__{i don't know... some people are okay, but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...}
