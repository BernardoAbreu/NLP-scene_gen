<L>__{75. interior a palace tunnel night}
<A>__{indy and short round enter the secret passage and move forward slowly into the inky darkness.}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{i don't think we suppose to be in here, indy...}
<A>__{they creep slowly down the dark tunnel. it grows smaller and indy ducks his head.}
<C>__{short round }
<D>__{i step on something.}
<A>__{their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you're right, there's something all over the floor...}
<A>__{even short round has to duck and indy finally kneels to his hands and knees.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{we'll have to crawl.}
<A>__{as they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what ever it is littering the ground.}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{indy, the floor there is some thing alive!}
<A>__{indiana gets a match out of his pocket. he snaps it with his thumb and the match flares a hideous insectarium: a living collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch nids.}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{holy smoke i'm scared, indy!}
<A>__{indiana turns and sees something else }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{there's a chamber here. come on }
<A>__{indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it. short round happily scampers into the chamber and indy follows him. suddenly the door slides shut trapping them inside!}
