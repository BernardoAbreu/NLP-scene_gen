<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{momma?}
<A>__{skeeter's mother, charlotte boudreau cantelle phelan, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn colored, `pixie' cut.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{is this a little too young?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{it's a little too everything.}
<A>__{charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up face. charlotte puts on a classic bouffant flip in dark brown.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{much better.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{your daddy bought me this dress in `58.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{mom, i want to ask you about constantine }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ right after ole miss won the sugar bowl.}
<A>__{charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{come on, you try it on.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{what really happened?}
<A>__{charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i told you...she went to live with her people in chicago...now, skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress.}
<A>__{charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress. skeeter begins taking off her clothes.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{how could she just take off without telling me?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i told her not to write you. i didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. honey, we were just a job to her. with them it's all about money...did i tell you fanny peatrow got engaged? after she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{good for "fat fanny peatrow."}
<A>__{she lowers the dress over skeeter's head and zips it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{this looks precious on you! four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with?}
<C>__{skeeter charlotte}
<A>__{a diploma. a pretty piece of paper.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{hilly and elizabeth have such lovely children.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{they dropped out of college to become housewives, mother.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{if only you'd show a little gumption, eugenia...}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{well, i did get a job today.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{writing...for the jackson journal.}
<A>__{charlotte plumps up the dress around skeeter's behind.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{great. you can write my obituary. "charlotte phelan dead. her daughter still single."}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{momma, would it really be so terrible if i never met a husband?}
<A>__{with that, charlotte grabs skeeter's hand and takes her to a love seat. they sit. this is serious.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i need to...ask you something, skeeter. i read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts.}
<A>__{charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{are you...do you...find men attractive? are you having unnatural thoughts about...}
<A>__{charlotte shuts her eyes tight.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{girls or...or women?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea.}
<A>__{skeeter jumps up.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{mother, i want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with jameso.}
<C>__{charlotte}
