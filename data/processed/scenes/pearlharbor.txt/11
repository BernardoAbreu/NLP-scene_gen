<L>__{interior a moving train day}
<A>__{the trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats, shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy section. but the glow of the train is outshone by evelyn stewart. she's one of ten young women, army nurses, gathered at one end of the car as it rattles along the track. the other nurses are pretty and ripe maybe a bit too ripe. their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered, their spirits high. evelyn listens in amusement to betty, a cute blonde with unmissable boobs, and barbara, a burnette equally endowed.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you mean hiding them?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hide them? on a date with pilots? i'm talking about how you make them show!}
<A>__{sandra, another nurse, speaks up.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{loan 'em to me, i will make 'em show.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the boobs or the pilots?}
<A>__{the girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party wherever they go. but evelyn can't keep her mind on the frivolity. she looks out the window and her thoughts drift away.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we'll ask evelyn. evelyn? evelyn!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ooo, she's thinking of her date! come on, you've been dating a pilot. we want to know what we can expect.}
<A>__{suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at evelyn.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i've been dating one pilot. and only for a few weeks. but i know he's different from all the others.}
<A>__{sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{true love!...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{morphine, give her morphine!}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{give her an enema.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{but i do have a warning for you. there's one line you all need to know, and you're likely to hear it from any man in a uniform. it goes like this: "honey, baby... we never know what's gonna happen, and i may die tomorrow...so, let's live all we can tonight."}
<A>__{a silence among the nurses.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i tell you. any one of those arrogant, leather jacketed, slick lookin' flyboys tries that line on me...he's gonna get anything he wants.}
<A>__{as the nurses laugh }
