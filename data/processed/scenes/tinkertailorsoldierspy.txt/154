<C>__{percy alleline}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what's that shrug for?}
<A>__{he slams a hand on the desk, tea cups rattling, a sudden roar.}
<C>__{percy alleline }
<D>__{i'm talking to you about a murderer. i'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section! i'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back! don't damn well shrug at me! how'd you like a term in prison?}
<A>__{guillam's own temper comes to his rescue.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{but i haven't been seeing him! so get your facts straight and get off my back!}
<A>__{a moment, while the room digests this. a relaxation of the tension, as if he's passed some kind of test.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{so if i told you that tarr had recently arrived in paris would you be surprised?}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{nothing would surprise me about tarr.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{and if i told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?}
<A>__{this does shock guillam, but he manages to hold on to his sullen expression.}
<C>__{percy alleline }
<D>__{your man's a defector, guillam. got turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us!}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{never mind what for! to muddy the water, that's what for! spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! the point is this he's heading for home. the first peep from him you come to the grown ups, understood? anyone you see at this table. but not another damn soul!}
