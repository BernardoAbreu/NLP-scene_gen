<L>__{interior phelan plantation (flashback) dining room day}
<A>__{charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch. as the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to charlotte.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{then, she burned the coffee. she had gotten so old, skeeter.}
<A>__{charlotte shoots constantine a look. constantine nods sorrowfully. she picks up a woman's plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly. constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman. her hands tremble.}
<D>__{charlotte (v.o.) (cont'd) her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and i had had it.}
<A>__{the plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{watch out!}
<A>__{with that, charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{get a hold of yourself, constantine!}
<A>__{constantine slowly looks to charlotte. totally exhausted, she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself.}
<D>__{charlotte (v.o.) (cont'd) and that's when it happened.}
<A>__{constantine wets herself. slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. the two women closest to constantine gasp and quickly move away from her. another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room. just now realizing what has happened, constantine looks down at her soiled dress. no one says a word. no one comes to constantine's aid. constantine looks to charlotte.}
