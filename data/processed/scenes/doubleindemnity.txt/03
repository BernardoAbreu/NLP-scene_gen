<A>__{a 38 dietrichson home entrance hall (day) the camera pans with phyllis dietrichson's feet and ankles as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the tiles. the anklet glistens on her leg as she moves. the camera pans on. phyllis has reached the entrance hall, and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. she wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips. she opens the door. outside is neff, wearing a sport coat, flannel slacks. he takes his hat off.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{hello, mr. neff.}
<A>__{he stands there with a little smile.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{aren't you coming in?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm considering it.}
<A>__{he comes in.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment. last night wasn't so convenient.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's okay. i was working on my stamp collection.}
<A>__{she leads him toward living room. a 39 dietrichson living room phyllis and neff come through archway. she heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i was just fixing some iced tea. would you like a glass?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{unless you have a bottle of beer that's not working.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{there might be some. i never know what's in the ice box.}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{nettie!...}
<A>__{she pours herself a glass of tea.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{about those renewals, mr. neff. i talked to my husband about it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes. he'll renew with you he told me. in fact, i thought he'd be here this afternoon.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{but he's not?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's terrible.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(calls again, impatiently)}
<D>__{nettie!... nettie!... oh, i forgot, it's the maid's day off.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{don't bother, mrs. dietrichson. i'd like some iced tea very much.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{lemon? sugar?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{fix it your way.}
<A>__{she fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around. he slowly sits down.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{seeing it's the maid's day off maybe there's something i can do for you.}
<A>__{she hands him the tea.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{like running the vacuum cleaner.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{fresh.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i used to peddle vacuum cleaners. not much money but you learn a lot about life.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{where did you pick up this tea drinking? you're not english, are you?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no. californian. born right here in los angeles.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{they say native californians all come from iowa.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i wanted to ask you something, mr. neff.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{make it walter.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{tell me, walter, on this insurance how much commission do you make?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{twenty percent. why?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i thought maybe i could throw a little more business your way.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i can always use it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i was thinking about my husband. i worry a lot about him, down in those oil fields. it's very dangerous.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not for an executive, is it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he doesn't just sit behind a desk. he's right down there with the drilling crews. it's got me worried sick.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you mean a crown block might fall on him some rainy night?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{please don't talk like that.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{but that's the idea.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{the other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman. he's in the hospital with a broken back.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{bad.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's got me jittery just thinking about it. suppose something like that happened to my husband?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it could.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{don't you think he ought to have accident insurance?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what kind of insurance could he have?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills. say a hundred and twenty five a week cash benefit. and he'd rate around fifty thousand capital sum.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{capital sum? what's that?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's if he got killed. maybe i shouldn't have said that.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i suppose you have to think of everything in your business.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{mr. dietrichson would understand. i'm sure i could sell him on the idea of some accident protection. why don't i talk to him about it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{you could try. but he's pretty tough going.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{they're all tough at first.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he's got a lot on his mind. he doesn't want to listen to anything except maybe a baseball game on the radio. sometimes we sit all evening without saying a word to each other.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sounds pretty dull.}
<A>__{phyllis shrugs.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{so i just sit and knit.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{is that what you married him for?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{maybe i like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{anytime his thumbs get tired }
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i want to ask you something, mr. neff. could i get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how's that again.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that would make it easier for you, too. you wouldn't even have to talk to him. i have a little allowance of my own. i could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wait a minute. why shouldn't he know?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{because i know he doesn't want accident insurance. he's superstitious about it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{a lot of people are. funny, isn't it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{if there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over. you see what i mean, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. i've got good eyesight. you want him to have the policy without him knowing it. and that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know. that's the set up, isn't it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{is there anything wrong with it?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i think it's lovely. and then, some dark wet night, if that crown block fell on him }
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what crown block?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only sometimes they have to have a little help. they can't quite make it on their own.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. it can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not that crazy. goodbye, mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{he picks up his hat.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, baby, you can't get away with it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{get away with what?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you want to knock him off, don't you, baby.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that's a horrible thing to say!}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{who'd you think i was, anyway? a guy that walks into a good looking dame's front parlor and says "good afternoon, i sell accident insurance on husbands. you got one that's been around too long? somebody you'd like to turn into a little hard cash? just give me a smile and i will help you collect." boy, what a dope i must look to you!}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i think you're rotten.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i think you're swell. so long as i'm not your husband.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you bet i will. you bet i will get out of here, baby. but quick.}
<A>__{he goes out. she looks after him. a 40 exterior dietrichson home (day) neff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car and drives away.}
