<A>__{reed and sue enter. reed is looking for something. sue slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam packed with gear, gadgets, blueprints, inventions. awe inspiring, overflowing.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you really need to get a janitor.}
<A>__{she stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{this must be what it looks like inside your head.}
<A>__{reed finds his electron microscope. he turns to sue, defensive:}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{there's a system to it.}
<A>__{she starts to pull out a model of the fantasticar.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{wait! sue, don't touch tha }
<A>__{the little car sets the whole shelf off balance. a wave of inventions come clattering down! reed moves fast: he lunges toward sue, streetching his arms around the shelf, pushing sue away, just as the inventions smash to the ground! reed and sue hit the floor. a close call. now more closeness: sue and reed lay face to face, with reed's wrapped around her. a heated beat. their first real intimate moment.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{sorry. my fault. i won't...touch anything.}
<A>__{as if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, sue and reed stand, backing off. as they part, we see: ben watching from the doorway. melancholy. he disappears. we slowly move to...a surveillance camera in a vent grate.}
