<A>__{the three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{why do i have to wear a helmet?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{safety first.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but you guys don't wear them.}
<A>__{she looks around.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i only see little kids wearing them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{cause they're still learning, too. come on, i'm not gonna argue about this.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{even extreme boarders wear helmets. nobody makes fun of them.}
<A>__{she begrudgingly puts on her helmet. she's not happy about it. dan and lynch smile.}
<D>__{dan lynch awww.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're just doing this to make fun of me.}
<A>__{dan's laughing.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i swear. you look hot in a helmet.}
<A>__{off to the side, lynch spots shannon (cute, brunette, 20's) struggling with her boot strap. she falls down on her ass. lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{need some help?}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{do you think?}
<A>__{lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost directly into his face. parker and dan watch from afar as lynch helps her with her boot strap. he has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is fastening the strap with his other.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{aww, check out lynch.}
<A>__{from their point of view, they watch lynch helping the girl.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{see? chick magnet.}
<A>__{almost as if on cue, ryan (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps over and shoves lynch down into the snow.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{lynch tries to get up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{woah! shit, man! i was just trying to help!}
<A>__{instantly, dan moves over to lynch's aid. parker follows slowly behind him. she's clearly not too good on her board.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{ryan, what the hell?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{he had his hands all over you!}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{no he didn't. i can take care of myself!}
<A>__{she shoves him back. ryan just shakes his head at her and shoves off, away from the group. he waits for her down the hill a few feet. dan and shannon help lynch to his feet.}
<C>__{shannon }
<D>__{i am so sorry about that. he can be such an asshole sometimes.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i was seriously just trying to help. i mean, how could i even compete with a catch like that?}
<A>__{he waves to ryan. ryan just looks away.}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, i'm fine.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{well, thank you for your help. i am so, so sorry about that.}

<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{well it was nice to meet you.}
<A>__{she takes off after ryan.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to his friends)}
<D>__{i was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i know you were, man. come on. don't sweat it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{seriously, that guy was such a dick.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{come on boys. we can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.}
<A>__{lynch starts down the hill.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm tough.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i know you are.}
<A>__{they push off out of frame.}
