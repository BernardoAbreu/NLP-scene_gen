<A>__{the mugger heads toward 321 prospect place. the streets are lined with old apartment buildings. many windows are boarded up. two men, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of heavy machinery onto the pavement. sam hears gospel music coming from a storefront church and notices a sign, "sister oda mae brown, medium, spirit reader, advisor." he looks up to a third story window and sees a similar sign with day glo arrows pointing to the entrance on the street. he seems curious, but then realizes that the mugger is nearly halfway down the block. he turns and rushes after him.}
