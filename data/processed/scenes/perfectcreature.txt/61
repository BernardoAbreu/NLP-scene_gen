<L>__{ext: brotherhood building, foyer day establisher}
<A>__{we tilt down a grand building.}
<L>__{int: brotherhood building, foyer day}
<A>__{a huge foyer, shinning marble floors. all done in perfect taste. we see silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator. the elevator doors close.}
<L>__{int: brotherhood building, security control room day}
<A>__{silus enters the room. there are several technicians at work at a console; again the organic nouveaux stylings of the brothers. augustus is also there. next to him, someone who is obviously human. his lack of perfection stands out; the balding hair, dark rings under his eyes. silus joins them.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{silus. you know professor liepsky.}
<A>__{silus shakes the professor's hand. we see the hands touching, then slide apart with a wisping sound that makes the professor wince a little.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{how is he?}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{see for yourself.}
<A>__{he taps one of the men at the console on the shoulder. the man hits a button and we see that in front of the console there is a huge glass window and beyond it a room which is now lit. edgar is in there. and edgar is not pleased. even from here his glowering stare penetrates everyone in the room. from this distance we can't make out much, beyond the fact that edgar is seated in a chair, in an otherwise plain white room. around his chair is a strange "brace" of sorts, that seems to be holding edgar in place.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{is the brace necessary?}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{he decapitated a guard as they brought him in. even though he was sedated. he said he will drink us all dry.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{insane then.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{not quite.}
<A>__{silus now turns to the professor.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's become infected.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{with what?}
<A>__{the professor looks to augustus, as if worried he's said to much.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{go on, brother silus will soon be part of the inner circle of the brotherhood. he should know this.}
<A>__{cut to}
