<L>__{interior lex's basement bedroom night}
<A>__{an inner sanctum of kiss devotion. faux wood paneling is plastered with countless kiss posters, pictures, fold outs. the ceiling is wallpapered with more kiss posters. kiss dolls, magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag carpeted floor. fast food wrappers heap over the kiss garbage pail. the four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off key.}
<C>__{boys singing}
<D>__{"i wanna rock 'n' roll all night and party every day!"}
<A>__{they stink, but they sure are trying hard. meet the band "mystery." concert tee shirts, holey jeans, total burn outs. hawk, a scraggily haired, disenchanted youth, strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he scratches at his rhythm guitar. hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but knowing the others, that doesn't say much. lex pounds a bass with earnest determination. lanky with bad posture, lex is already sporting worry lines. he takes everything way too seriously. trip strums lead guitar like he's hammering nails. all id, trip is slightly out of his mind. but, is it the chemicals or just his chemistry. he always wears a knit cap. jam, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), bashes on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. the big drum bears the word "mystery" painted on its skin with a lightning "s" just like the kiss logo. they bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the kiss symbol. hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thank you, cleveland! you're a great crowd. but after three and a half hours of kick ass rock and seven encores on top of that, i'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies.}
<A>__{behind him, trip grabs lex's bass and swings it by the neck at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. lex quickly yanks it away from him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{what the fuck, trip? that's my bass!}
<A>__{jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{that was curly!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{just one more day of school to get through, girls, before tomorrow night... live!}
<P>__{(getting excited)}
<D>__{cobo hall! detroit, michigan!}
<P>__{(like an announcer)}
<D>__{you wanted the best!}
<C>__{all four boys}
<D>__{you got the best! the hottest band in the world... kiss!!}
<A>__{they all make that breath sound that mimics a screaming crowd. suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like a spotlight. lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the cellar window. lex's pov a baby shit green, ford station wagon with fake wood sides screeches into the driveway. mrs. bruce gets out and stomps toward the house. lex gasps at the sight.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{shit! it's jam's mom!}
<A>__{jam gulps as if he's just shat out an whole can of lincoln logs.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{my mom? oh, no! what's she doing here?}
<A>__{lex quickly throws a kiss towel over a tv tray hiding a bong, cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. trip kicks half empty beer bottles under the bed. hawk sprays lysol frantically around the room as jam shovels gum into his mouth. knock, knock, knock! mrs. bruce pounds on the cellar window crouching to see in. she looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<P>__{(muffled through glass)}
<D>__{jeremiah! jeremiah bruce! you get out here this instant!}
<A>__{the boys looks up like innocent, wide eyed angels. jam waves.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{oh, hi, mom.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn, denim jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor, then runs upstairs. the others follow.}
