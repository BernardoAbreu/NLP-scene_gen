<ACTION>__{CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.}

<DIAL>__{They say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in their room.  But of course the stations in Izu are different from the ones in Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty channel, so he shouldve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says--}
<ACTION>__{Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko actually jumps in her seat.}

<DIAL>__{You watched it, didnt you?  That same time, exactly one week later... hes dead!}
<ACTION>__{Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance. Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.}

<CHAR>__{MASAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Man, you had me freaked me out. I--}
<ACTION>__{Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, following her friends gaze. Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40. The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend, looking panicked.}
<CHAR>__{MASAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(softly)}
<DIAL>__{Was it true?}
<ACTION>__{Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko calls out to her from behind.}

<ACTION>__{Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin.}
<CHAR>__{MASAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ill put her on.}
<ACTION>__{Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it quickly.}
<CHAR>__{TOMOKO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{TOMOKO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, man!}

<ACTION>__{Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator door to check for the source of the sound. She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM adjacent the kitchen.}
<LOC>__{INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up quite high. A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.}
<LOC>__{INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink. Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING. Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream. The screen goes white, and fades into:}

Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in shadows, looking down from above. What is this? The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve- wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns towards where that figure stood, and smiles. The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out only two things recognizable: local     volcanic eruption Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies them. - A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The insect-like screeching sounds louder. -- Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity." The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains. --- A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL. ---- Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends. Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, spins around. The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket-- --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie- like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly. From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK. Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.}

Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.

No. Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, falling to his knees on the tatami. The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; the shot of the well. The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with terrible foreboding. There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly pulling herself out.

The joints of her body twist unnaturally, more insect-like than human. Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls to the floor, panting heavily. Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, unbridled hatred.
