<D>__{the truth about me is, willy...i'm really not very nice.}
<A>__{willy nods. concealing the ace up his sleeve.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you sure do know a lot, though. got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. must be kind of...boring. at that pointerior}
<C>__{crawford}
