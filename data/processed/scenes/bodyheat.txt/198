<L>__{exterior gazebo walker house night}
<A>__{close on racine's watch ten o five. the wind chimes on the gazebo tinkle. racine sits smoking in the shadows. he takes another drink from a glass of liquor. all the lights on the lawn, gazebo and boathouse are off. racine hears something and peers toward the driveway. headlights move very slowly up the drive toward the house. it is edmund's cadillac, glowing in the moonlight. the cadillac stops in front of the house and for several moments nothing happens. then matty gets out of the car waterway. she is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight. racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo. silently. matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when she can make out the boathouse in the gloom. she stares at it a moment then turns back toward the house. racine steps to the edge of the gazebo. matty seems startled for only a split second.}
