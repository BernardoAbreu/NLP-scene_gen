<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior the strip night}
<A>__{ben and sera walk and talk.}
<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{ben and sera are eating. he plays with his food, eating very little of it. finally he pushes it away and orders another drink.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i'm from the east. i went to college, did an arts course. i now live in vegas. i think of it as home. i came here deliberately to carve out a life. i was in la before, but i will come back to that later.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the tough times are behind me now. i can deal with the bad things that happen. there will always be dark characters. but my life is good. it is as i would want it to be. so, why are you a drunk?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{is that really what you want to ask me?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{well, then i guess this is our first date... or our last. until now, i wasn't sure it was either.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{very clever. sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on}
<A>__{this.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{first. it's our first. i'm just concerned. so... why are you killing yourself?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{interesting choice of words. i don't remember. i just know that i want to.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{want to kill yourself? are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?}
<A>__{and she leans across the table to be close to him, listening intently. ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{or killing myself as a way to drink.}
<A>__{sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real answer. he takes a slug from his drink. she sits back.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we'll talk about it some other time maybe. ok?}
<A>__{sera relaxes and continues with her food. we hear her thoughts for a moment.}
<C>__{sera }
<D>__{it wasn't so important to me. i mean, he never asked me why i was a hooker, sand that was impressive. i really liked him. so i decided to just play my part. i mean... it's good to help someone once in a while., it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. i suddenly came to a decision.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what are you thinking? are you angry with me?}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(decides something)}
<D>__{ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? i mean... look, you're so drunk. i like you. i trust you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's astonishing. sera, look...}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{i hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. i mean...}
<A>__{and she folds her arms and grins at him.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in las vegas?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(overwhelmed by her)}
<D>__{i'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{let's talk about tomorrow. wanna do something?}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{sure... tonight. then please stay at my place.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sera... you know i'm not much good in the sack.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{it's not about sex, ben. i will make you up a bed on the sofa. do it for me. we can talk till late and then sleep till late. as you know, i am my own boss.}
<A>__{ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his laugh as infectious, and sera join in. other diners turn to stare at them. they seem like a couple.}
