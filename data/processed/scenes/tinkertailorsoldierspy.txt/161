<A>__{the two men are finishing off a bottle of scotch. unusually, smiley is drunk a result of the alcohol and the lack of sleep. guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the photographs of the four suspects smiley has pinned on his chessmen.}

<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{i wanted to believe tarr was lying. (beat) all this time, thinking i'm fighting a war. it's a sham. karla won years ago and we didn't even know it.}
<A>__{smiley watches guillam, estimating how badly all of this is affecting him.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i met him once. karla.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{in fifty five. moscow centre was in pieces. purge after purge. half their agents were jumping ship and i travelled around signing them up. hundreds of them.}
<A>__{guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{one of them was calling himself gerstmann. he was on his way back to russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. plane had a twenty four lay over at delhi, and that's how long i had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.}
<A>__{smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of the delhi cell onto their present surroundings.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{little room...i'm sitting here...he's sitting there...}
<A>__{he points to an empty chair in front of him.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{the americans have had him tortured.}
<A>__{he holds up his right hand.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{no fingernails. it's incredibly hot. i'm very tired and all i want to do is get this over with and get back home. things weren't going well with ann.}
<A>__{guillam flinches a little, but smiley doesn't notice, lost now in the past.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{i give him the usual pitch... come to the west and we can give you a comfortable life. after questioning. or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like bykov, shur, muranov...}
<A>__{he stares at the chair as if expecting an answer, and slightly drunkenly guillam finds himself turning to the chair for a response.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<A>__{smiley doesn't answer stares at the chair the silence stretching it's all becoming a little surreal.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(to the chair)}
<D>__{think of your wife. you have a wife, don't you? i brought you some cigarettes, by the way.}
<A>__{he mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between him and the chair.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{use my lighter.}
<A>__{he mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{"we could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. if you go back, she'll be ostracised. think of her. think about how much she..."}
<A>__{he breaks off in sudden impatience with himself.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{kept harping on about the damn wife! telling him more about me, than... should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one. (beat) so i go on. "know you're a chain smoker, help yourself," "we're not so very different you and i.."}
<A>__{he makes a vague "etcetera" gesture, stares at...}
<B>__{the empty chair}
<A>__{... something unsettling about it, as if somehow it is acquiring the ghostly presence of karla.}
<C>__{smiley }
<P>__{(to the chair)}
<D>__{look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems. don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?}
<A>__{silence. smiley sits back, dropping the game.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{never said a word. not one word. next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched this was a chain smoker, mind and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. he kept my lighter. it was a gift "to george, from ann. all my love."}
<A>__{guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe struck.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{that was karla? and he flew back to die rather than give in?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{yes. (beat) and that's how i know he can be beaten. because he's a fanatic. and the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{what did he look like?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{that's the thing. (beat) i can't remember.}
<A>__{he stands up, crosses to the window, embarrassed by what he has to say nexterior}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{after today, peter you have to assume they're watching you. if there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time.}
<A>__{guillam stares at him, realising what he's talking about.}
