<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{close on the lower half of the front doors as they fly open. out come two men in long dark raincoats.}
<B>__{wellman}
<A>__{runs up, stopping in the open door.}
<C>__{wellman}
<D>__{hey, wait!}
<B>__{very close on the two men}
<A>__{as they slowly turn to face wellman. we just see their faces, shielded from the rain by hat brims. meet...}
<B>__{tom and charlie}
<A>__{tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. charlie, 50, with a tough, red face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<B>__{wellman}
<A>__{looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.}
<C>__{wellman}
<D>__{you forgot to sign.}
<B>__{tom and charlie}
<A>__{we see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that they are armored car drivers. there's an armored car parked at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags. charlie sighs, goes back to wellman and perfunctorily signs the form. then he and tom go to the sandbag wall. tom holds both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. charlie doesn't want to get wet. he steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the truck, then keys open the doors.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{charlie reaches out for the money bags. tom jumps off the sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{for christsakes!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's a flood, charlie. you're gonna get wet.}
<A>__{charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back. he moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the water. tom splashes him some more.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey! do you know what kind of crap is in that water?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(of course he knows)}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<A>__{tom kicks some more water at charlie. charlie gives tom a withering look and climbs in the truck.}
