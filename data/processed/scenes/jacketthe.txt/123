<A>__{mackenzie sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the hallway is clear of the staff. then he scuttles quickly all the time close to the wall to starks' room.}
<L>__{interior starks' room, alpine grove, day, 1992}
<A>__{mackenzie gets inside, ducks as a nurse passes and then taps lightly on the wall, announcing himself gladly.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{hey, i brought you some smokes.}
<A>__{starks doesn't waste any time.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{lorenson said your wife left you for another man and that's when you lost it.}
<A>__{mackenzie almost imperceptibly winces confirming the truth for starks before he has to sit down.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{is it true?}
<A>__{mackenzie tosses him the cigarettes and lights himself one.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{she left me, i tried to kill her, i tried to kill myself. she was mean, i was weak, i was cruel so she left, i didn't plan it, didn't see it...fine!}
<A>__{mackenzie suddenly stops, distraught. when he resumes, it's in an oddly more normal tone than he's ever used before.}
<D>__{mackenzie [softly] i didn't want to see it. i'm in here because they say i have a nervous condition. [beat] well, here's my question, who wouldn't be nervous if they really looked at their life? [beat] whose life is that good?}
<A>__{starks doesn't have an answer.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{not this luckless little mammal's. what difference is it to them? [beat, slows down] you believe what you want to believe. one version is easier than another so you make it your own.}
<A>__{as mackenzie runs his hand over his forehead, he looks hurt, and sad, but strangely not a bit crazy.}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i will tell you this though. however nuts i am, i wasn't nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human being in something like that.}
<A>__{mackenzie's twitching continues as he recollects it.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{mackenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{[shrugging] what if we are? there're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [beat] everyone does it, don't they? even becker. that roller coaster car pops more pills than all of ward 3.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{becker does? are you sure?}
<C>__{mackenzie}
<D>__{i've been here for 11 years. it's my neighborhood. 'course i'm sure. he's as drugged up as the rest of us...i guess he has to be to put up with all this.}
<A>__{starks nods and mackenzie puts his head down, suddenly vulnerable and embarrassed. starks lights two cigarettes.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{thanks for the cigarettes. you still got a lot of problems, mackenzie, but you're ok.}
<A>__{mackenzie and starks smoke together quietly.}
