<L>__{exterior desert rock outcrop day}
<A>__{big slabs jutting this way and that a rock iceberg in a sand ocean. the people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy and relief. melvin charges up to burt:}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you asshole! there's no bullets in this gun!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{got you moving, didn't it?}
<A>__{burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling. the effect is instantly sobering. burt swiftly grabs out his remaining bombs six of them and holds one ready. but they're in no immediate danger.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{so...now what?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{could we make it to the mountains?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(gestures to burt's bombs)}
<D>__{no way. we'd need fifty of those things.}
<A>__{the hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits val, earl, and rhonda. after a moment:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well...that's it. we're not getting off this rock...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{not going to pole vault anywhere. that's for sure.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? what are you talking about?!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{they'll just wait out there till we're dead. that's what they do.}
<A>__{as this sinks in, burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{what? well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place! we had food, water...}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you can't fight'em that way...}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{back off, burt...!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{well, who put you two in charge?}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{burt! those animals would have killed you!}
<A>__{everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet nancy.}
<C>__{nancy }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you haven't seen what they can do.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(calmer)}
<D>__{they'd have dug your place out from under you in half an hour!}
<A>__{there's a long, grim silence. everyone sits glumly. finally, burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:}
<C>__{burt}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{if it comes to starvation, i know what i'm doing. take one of these. walk right out there with the fuse lit. stuff it down my pants and let 'em take me down. boooom!}
<A>__{heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{jesus, honey!}
<A>__{but now earl brightens a little.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you know, that's not a bad idea!}
<A>__{the others react. is earl nuts?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no, i mean, it gives me an idea... going fishing like...}
