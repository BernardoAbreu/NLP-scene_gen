<L>__{interior laurel canyon house day}
<A>__{andy is doing laundry. he empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug. then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns. focused, impassive, andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it. lynne enters, emotionally wrecked. she stares in frustration at andy's behavior.}
<C>__{lynne}
<D>__{how can you be so casual??!}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{even if i'm dying i still need clean socks.}
<C>__{lynne}
<D>__{you're not dying!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{okay. you're probably right.}
<A>__{he keeps working. lynne loses it.}
<C>__{lynne}
<D>__{god, you're so detached!!}
<A>__{lynne storms out. andy finishes his socks. satisfied... he turns on the tv. on the tv: it's "lassie." little timmy is laid up in bed, with a broken leg. suddenly lassie runs in, holding a book. lassie places the book on his lap. the boy smiles gratefully.}
<C>__{timmy }
<D>__{thank you, girl. you're my best friend.}
<A>__{timmy warmly embraces the dog. andy is terribly touched. tears start rolling down his face. genuine sobbing. terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks. andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone. he dials a long number.}

<D>__{dad...?}
