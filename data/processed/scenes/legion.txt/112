<A>__{jeep and charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below. on their faces, reacting to what they see. charlie takes jeep's hand in hers.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{we made it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yep, we sure did.}
<A>__{and now we see it too: the mojave desert dawn vast. barren. no signs of life. no resistance force. no nothing.}
<B>__{on jeep and charlie}
<A>__{taking it in. breathing hard.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i'm sure they're just over the next ridge.}
<A>__{he glances at charlie. worry in her eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what if we're on our own now?}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{don't be afraid. we'll be okay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{believe me.}
<A>__{at those words, charlie looks deep into jeep's eyes. sees a confidence in them she's never seen before. and she leans in and kisses him. tender. when they part, jeep stares back at her with surprise. then the surprise melts into a smile. and they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a view once again of the mojave desert dawn a blood red sun rises behind the distant mountains. the unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat. and we're back where we started. a young woman's voice. solemn. weary. determined. it's charlie's voice.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
