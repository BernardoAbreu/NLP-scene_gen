<A>__{she points to kat walkman blaring who comes downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered levis. her relaxing at home look is about 400 times sexier than her at school look. she wanders toward the kitchen. walter directs his attention toward kat.}

<D>__{bogey lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's a bogey lowenstein?}
<A>__{kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{at least i'm not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig.}
<A>__{bianca tosses her hair.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{like i'm supposed to know what that even means.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{it's shakespeare. maybe you've heard of him?}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{yeah, he's your freak friend mandella's boyfriend. i guess since i'm not allowed to go out, i should obsess over a dead guy, too.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{girls}
<A>__{kat stares bianca down}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i know about the goddamn party. i'm going.}

<D>__{it's just a party. daddy.}

<D>__{just for a minute}
<A>__{he rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux pregnancy belly.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i want you to realize the weight of your decisions.}
<A>__{he hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{you are so completely unbalanced.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{can we go now?}
<C>__{walter}

<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{because she'll scare them away.}
<A>__{kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall table and a sweater from the coat rack. she flings open the door and... there stands patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{nine thirty right?}
<A>__{kat's in shock}
