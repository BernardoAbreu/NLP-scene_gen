<A>__{in the b.g. comes drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his head. he is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk. drew walks up to ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that for a moment. she then turns to him, and starts to say something. drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.}

<D>__{ashema, beautiful ashema, i can't see you anymore. i will... miss you and remember you... always.}
<A>__{ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head against drew's shoulder.}

<D>__{are they making you do this?}
<A>__{she wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. she needs to hear it. drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. it would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no. it is my choice, and my responsibility. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{he embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. he holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last long look at ashema, walks away.}
