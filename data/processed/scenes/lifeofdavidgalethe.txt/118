<L>__{interior law office of benjamin belyeu day}
<A>__{the office has a view of the rain soaked capital. expensively decorated. dark woods and deep carpets belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. a sharp looking clerk sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase. bitsey sits on a huge sofa. belyeu stands just outside his door.}
<C>__{belyeu }
<D>__{fine. oh, and bring in miss bloom's original when that's done.}
<P>__{(entering, to bitsey)}
<D>__{don't blame you for not watching that twice.}
<A>__{he goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep afterwards.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{i understand. i generally tell folks i'm no more afraid of the grim reaper than i am of a presbyterian on mother's day. but watching your tape... well. i had to keep tellin' myself 'that's not constance' just to get through.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{unfortunately, others may argue the same.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{currently home to weirdos incorporated. arguably, that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{but it will at least get us a postponement?}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{i hope so, miss bloom, i certainly hope so. but you've got to remember that there's a machine a runnin'. and come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' that machine wants to be fed.}
<A>__{the clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{all here, mr. belyeu.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(to the clerk)}
<D>__{thank you, joshua.}
<P>__{(to bitsey)}
<D>__{to add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question.}
<A>__{the clerk exits.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{you've been fraternizin' with the condemned. in the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. he's a persuasive man, you're a out of state woman it don't look good on paper.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{but someone put it in my hotel room.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{a fact for which we have no evidence.}
<A>__{a very professional looking assistant enters, hands bitsey her video.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{thank you, bobbi.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{well, let's not start readin' kafka just yet. could we find a sympathetic judge. i will file within the hour. you headin' back over to ellis?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{belyeu}
<D>__{fine. i will call over at the motel later and give you an update.}
