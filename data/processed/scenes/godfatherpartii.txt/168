<L>__{interior 'superman show' med. view night}
<A>__{a large room with a succession of platforms arranged step like around a circular area which becomes a stage. there are a hundred or so people, practically all men, tourists and business men, standing on the different levels, forming the audience. in the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole, to which is tied a young cuban girl, in a flimsy white sacrificial slip. a small band, mostly drummers, play some latin music.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the spectacle. they're a little woozy from the drinks and late hour. michael is with them, but now we sense he is using this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some important conclusions.}
<C>__{questadt}
<D>__{why do we have to stand?}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{everyone stands. but it's worth it, watch!}
<B>__{view on the arena}
<A>__{now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and muscular cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though he were a captured slave. this is superman}
<B>__{view across the men to the stage}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{that's him; that's superman!}
<A>__{some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post. the music is percussive and wild.}
<B>__{med. view on the men}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{ohmygod. i don't believe it.}
<C>__{questadt}
<D>__{it's got to be fake.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{that's why they call him superman. johnny ola told me about this; i didn't believe it.}
<A>__{close on michael turning away. not because of the spectacle which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.}
<C>__{fredo }
<D>__{... but seeing is believing. ole johnny knows all the places. i tol' you... can you believe it?}
<A>__{if michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.}
<C>__{fredo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the old man roth, would never come; but johnny knows these places like the back of his hand...}
