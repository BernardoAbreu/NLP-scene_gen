<L>__{interior elevator, fusion reactor continuous}
<A>__{they descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{this is it, isn't it?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{the reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{is bruce wayne really that paranoid?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{i'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.}
<A>__{miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. she spots a figure deep within: bruce wayne.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i thought you might like to see what your investment built.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{no radiation, no fossil fuels. free, clean energy for an entire city.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{if it worked. it doesn't.}
<A>__{wayne leads miranda to the core. two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling ball sized mass of metal. wayne hits buttons the ball glows, then dies to cold.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{ignition, yes. but no chain reaction.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you've built a lot of security around a damp squib.}
<A>__{nothing.}
<D>__{about three years ago a russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. one week later your reactor started developing problems... (looks at wayne.) i think this machine works.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{miranda, if it were operational, the danger to gotham would be too great.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{would it make you feel better to know that the russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{someone else will work out what dr. pavel did. someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. i need you to take control of wayne enterprises and this reactor.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and to do what with it?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{nothing. until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and if we can't?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{decommission it. flood it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{if the world's not ready. yes.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i'm trusting you.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{doesn't count. you have no choice.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. i'm choosing to trust you, miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. please.}
<A>__{his eyes are genuine. pleading. miranda nods.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{we have a board meeting to get to.}
