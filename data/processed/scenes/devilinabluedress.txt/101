<L>__{exterior albright's cabin night}
<A>__{the cabin draws nearer as easy scrambles up the hill. he can hear daphne crying out something, but he can't make out the words. it quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a window with the shade pulled down. he moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through the crack between the shade and the windowsill. he can make out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low ceiling. smack! and daphne screams again.}
<C>__{albright's voice}
<D>__{come on, talk to me. talk to me while you still can.}
<C>__{daphne's voice}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{please! i don't have them! easy has them!}
<A>__{easy can barely make out shariff passing the window. he strains to see more.}
<C>__{albright's voice}
<D>__{you said he didn't know anything.}
<C>__{daphne's voice}
<D>__{i was lying!!}
<C>__{albright's voice}
<D>__{okay. grab that for me, shariff. it's ready.}
<A>__{and then scre e eam!! the kind that drops the bottom out of your stomach. the kind more akin to fear than the word itself... the kind that fries your skin with the cold chill of horror. s c r e eams again!!}
<C>__{daphne's voice}
<D>__{no o o o! please. no o o!}
<C>__{albright's voice}
<D>__{now talk to me, goddammit!}
<C>__{daphne's voice}
<D>__{no o o!}
<A>__{easy's gotta make a move. kablangalangle! he smashes the window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up. manny looks right up at his face as daphne arches and flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning her down on a battered old sofa. albright is holding a glowing red poker that shariff, standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him. easy starts blasting. kablaam! manny takes one to the throat. kablaam! albright and shariff lunge for cover, and daphne ducks down behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming. manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the side door just ahead of another kablaam! that digs out a chunk of the wall. easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting ready for manny who should be coming his way from the side door. he hears more steps stumble out and then... silence. and then, kablaam! blaam! two huge blasts rip right through the wall next to easy's head, and he scrambles to the side of the house, underneath another window with the shade pulled down.}
<C>__{albright }
<P>__{(to shariff)}
<D>__{who the hell's out there?}
<C>__{shariff}
<P>__{(getting frantic)}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<C>__{albright }
<D>__{that you, easy?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{tell us what you want, buddy. see what we can work out.}
<A>__{easy hears footsteps coming alongside the house where he had been moments ago. kablaam! blaam! albright has fired from the inside again, thinking it's him.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{mouse?}
<A>__{but it's manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air, stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. a walking dead man... easy hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a moment the gurgling stops.}
<C>__{albright }
<D>__{easy... hey, buddy}
<P>__{(then to shariff)}
<D>__{come on, goddammit!}
<A>__{daphne cries out and klablangle! easy breaks the window with the gun but kablaam! blaam! blaam! the windowsill tears out above his head and daphne screams again. easy looks up to see shariff, holding her in front of him as a shield. he's headed straight for easy, drawing a bead on him for the kill. and then kablaam! the back of shariff's skull flies off and mouse is in the side door, blasting. blaam! albright breaks for the window. blaam! the slug spins him halfway around but he hurls himself through the window backwards. easy scurries to the front of the house and blaam! the bullet goes wide and albright manages to get into his car and returns fire. blaam! blaam!... easy hits the deck. albright's engine roars to life and he squeals out on the gravel. mouse appears on the other side of the house and click! click! he's out of ammo. he pulls out the other pistol, but it's too late.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{damn, damn, damn! i hit him! i hit him!}
<A>__{easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front door.}
