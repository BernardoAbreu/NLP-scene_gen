<A>__{this is a fairly large single room. the walls are bare and uninsulated. there are a few easels, but for the most part, the room is dominated by long tables and rough hewn benches. the light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey wood interior appear silver colored. alice, her hair in a bandana, has just finished sweeping up. the camera picks up on alice's sketch of the central camp area on one easel. on a second easel she has done the preliminary sketch of the lake itself. it is also a moody picture. alice cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a little, then goes on to her next task. there is a row of newly arrived cardboard boxes. she opens the first in cu with a matte knife. she take out the invoice and checks it against the first items: gimp, the plastic string from which all the campers will make lanyards.}
