<L>__{interior calitri's workshop}
<A>__{memphis can see this from one of the monitors. he looks at atley...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{car jacker. neglected to clean up after himself ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{jesus ...}
<C>__{atley jackson}
<D>__{the business has changed...}
<A>__{calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i don't want him hurt...}
<A>__{calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{i'm proud of this work. the bird feeder. the wagon wheel planter. the dollhouse. the drop leaf movable server...}
<A>__{he gestures to each item exquisitely rendered woodwork. then gestures to the yard...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{metal. steel. it's cold. ugly. wood is warm. clean. provided by nature. to see a piece of furniture take shape. it's like watching a child grow ...}
<A>__{memphis glances to atley... atley shrugs ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i'm sure you're working your way to the pointerior i will wait right here ...}
<A>__{calitri blinks. smiles. nods...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{my pointerior yes. simple, really. i require the best. i insist on the best. i only engage the best. your brother. his friends. they came to me. they wanted my paper. he was your brother. you were the best. now. they've brought so much goddamn heat down, i may not be able to fill this order. which would be very bad for me. which in turn, is very bad for them...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i could kill you. that occurred to me. when i first heard about this. that i would kill you ...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{grow up. you don't kill people like me. people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why? because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...}
<A>__{memphis nods, notes a pistol, resting on a shelf nearby.}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{no, no. you don't kill me, because you can't. you don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. you don't go to the police, because we have friends there, too. you do nothing: except deal with me.}
<A>__{memphis eyes him...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i can come up with the front money. pay you back...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{were it only that easy. i have obligations. the order needs to be filled...}
<A>__{calitri takes a manila envelope from his desk... hands it to memphis, who takes out the single sheet of paper inside.}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{on that list, you'll find fifty cars. fifty. five zero. they range in age from the 1956 ford thunderbird to the 1999 toyota camry; and in expense from the 1993 volkswagen jetta to the 1988 lamborghini countach. fifty cars. five zero.}
<A>__{memphis scans the list ... looks up at calitri ...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{there is a container ship in long beach harbor. pier 14. ready to be loaded with 4 car per shipping containers, false walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated. the ship leaves in four days for south america and the men who've tendered me this contract ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{they gave you only four days?}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{they gave me two weeks. i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...}
<A>__{memphis scans the list ...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{four days. 50 cars. i'm paying 200 thousand dollars ...}
<A>__{now memphis looks up...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i'm not interested }
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{i knew you'd say that.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i'm just here about my brother.}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{i knew you'd say that, too }
<A>__{calitri smiles ... memphis 'looks at him... at atley realizing the trap ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{sound it out for me.}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{your brother has four days. fifty cars. five zero. for that he gets 200 large ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{and if he doesn't make it ?}
<A>__{calitri goes to one corner of the shop... takes a tarp off of a full couch mahogany casket...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{i made this, too. my first one. brass extension handles, not plated. the coverings are silk, not rayon. expensive hardwood. and lined with spray green lorraine crepe ...}
<A>__{memphis waits, knowing where this is going }
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{yes, yes. i made it for young kip. in case he fails. at 8:00 friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... kip will take up permanent residence in this box ...}
<A>__{calitri wall switch and the a corrugated steel sliding door is raised, revealing a loading dock facing the back of the yard... two men are working out there... digger and butz scuzzy dudes, mid 30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{come here for a second, boys }
<A>__{and they come over }
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{evenin', mr. c. }
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{digger, butz: let me introduce you to randall raines. used to head up the dandiest ring in southern cal. left us for parts unknown. randall, this is digger. and that's butz }
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{hi, randall }
<A>__{memphis says nothing. calitri grins ... nods to digger an butz, who go back to work...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{digger and butz will be in charge of burial. they're good boys ...}
<A>__{memphis' look is cold and furious ... plaintive:}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i don't want them hurt. any of 'em...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{"don't want" the dodgers to lose or the summer to end. but we don't get to choose these things...}
<A>__{atley hits the wall switch and the steel door slides shut. calitri turns to memphis...}
<C>__{calitri }
<D>__{"nothing that's forced can ever be right." old woodworking expression. i really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... i just care that they do. you decide.}
<A>__{with that, he puts his protective glasses back on and fires up an abrasive disc finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the outside curve of an angled chamfer.}
