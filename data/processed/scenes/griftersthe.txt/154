<A>__{cu, lilly asleep. very dim light. the shadows shift on her face as myra out of frame approaches. myra's hands enter frame, abruptly clamp on lilly's throat. lilly's eyes pop open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. myra's arms are locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands squeezing lilly's throat. lilly clutches at myra's fingers, tries to reach myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun upward, straight arm, the gun moving up out of frame. sound of shot. blood sprays lilly's face. myra's body drops down onto her, at an angle, so we can still see lilly's horrified face over myra's shoulder as lilly gasps for breath.}
