<A>__{nick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking up speed like mad... he's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled employees. and here comes a man with a mail cart... whoosh! nick zips by him. and now an alarm is ringing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit...}
<L>__{interior another hallway day}
<A>__{nick comes screeching around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with two security guards.}
<D>__{guard #1 that's him!}
<A>__{but nick's already past them. he puts his foot down again, pushing for more momentum...}
<B>__{the guards}
<A>__{are after him now, charging down the hallway. up ahead, a set of double doors labeled "emergency exit" blocks his way. nick spins out, sweeping the back of the board forward and screams to a stop just before the doors. he kicks the board up into his free hand and... wham! he hits the doors running. now the fire alarm is blaring in addition to the other alarm. a voice is squawking over the p.a. and it's a hell of a racket.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(on p.a.)}
<D>__{security breach in r&d. subject heading towards eastern exit...}
