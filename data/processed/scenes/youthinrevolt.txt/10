<A>__{from the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle. then the ding dong of the front doorbell. the jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted. nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers. i e. estelle's home moments later the door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed sailors standing on the stoop. their eyes drift to nick's mid section. nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste. he returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt.}
