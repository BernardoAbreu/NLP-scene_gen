<L>__{interior bowling alley night}
<A>__{the place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. it's an old alley with overhead projection score sheets. kirk, stainer and devon sit and talk while jack throws a strike.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{atta boy jackers!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{it doesn't add up, kirk. if molly's so into you, why bring her friend and give you two tickets?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{she was hoping to set patty up with you.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh, great.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's okay, she wasn't interested.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{so you're saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isn't into me. will you listen to yourself? fuck you.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{what did molly have to say about all this?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i don't know, stainer, somebody got thrown out of the game and i had to drive him home, remember?}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{pretty impressive catch, kirky.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{there's no way. don't get him all worked up. her friend was fuckin' with him. molly said herself that patty loves to mess with people.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{kirk, you deserve a gal like her. and stainer, why don't you try to be a little more supportive.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{why don't you try a little shut the fuck up, devon. this week, we're not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are we still bowling?}
<A>__{stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{all i'm saying is she's just too hot. no judgement on kirky, the guy's just outgunned here.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i can't argue with him.}
<A>__{stainer goes to the line. the bowler (a pro type with a custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing about to roll. stainer starts to step up.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{yo, house ball! i was up first.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh for fucks... what is it with you people?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{just wait your turn.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{all this noise and bullshit in this place and i'm such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision!?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{okay stains, take it easy.}
<A>__{the bowler stands glaring back.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well!? fuckin' roll then!}
<A>__{the bowler takes another minute to set. stainer lets out a long sigh. the bowler steps to the line and stainer rushes into his own delivery. both men throw gutters. the bowler comes at stainer but their friends separate them.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{you're lucky motherfucker!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh yeah!? bring it, brunswick!}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{stainer! cool your jets, buster.}
<A>__{the bowler's friends drag him away. stainer takes a deep breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{okay. anyway... i love kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{stainer, that's just dirty pool. he's at least a four.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're outta your fuckin' mind four! you go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass. i'm just being honest.}
<A>__{stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass. it projects onto the overhead scoreboard.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i can live with three.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{he's a nice guy and he's funny. those are a half a point each.}
<A>__{stainer continues the equation on the projector.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{but he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{kirk said she likes his taurus.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{that's so fucked, i won't even dignify it with a response. so we're back to three. meanwhile, this molly is a hard ten.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{a hard ten?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind. that's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare. a seven point disparity that's a chasm. the most you can jump is two points. i can't even get a ten.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, not even you, huh?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{i'm a five, okay?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bullshit. then what am i?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're a seven and a half.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fine, you're a five then.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{okay, so i get a two point bump for being in a band. that puts me at seven. on a good day, most i can bag is a niner.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what about your shitty car?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{artist exemption. i'm expected to have a shitty car.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{is there an artist exemption for being a jag off?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fuckin' a there is.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer's right. patty was probably just messing around. it's not a big deal. let's just bowl.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{what about rick ocasek? billy joel, donald trump...}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{yeah, dumbass. those are the wild cards. money and fame.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so, if he were a millionaire?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{a mil ain't what it once was, jackie. devon's practically a millionaire for christ sake. a mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days two million minimum.}
<A>__{stainer finishes the equation by writing, "kirk = fucked." kirk's phone rings. he checks the id and his eyes go wide.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hey, molly... um, yeah, sure... no, that sounds good. yeah, i know where that is. um, okay, yeah... see you then.}
<A>__{kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{holy crap. (dazed pause) she just asked me out for tomorrow night!}
<A>__{kirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with devon and jack. stainer shakes his head, still not buying it.}
