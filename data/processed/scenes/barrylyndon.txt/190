<L>__{interior london club night}
<A>__{action as per voice over. roderick is shunned.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{if i had murdered my lord, i could scarcely have been received with more shameful obloquy and slander than now followed me in town and country. my friends fell away from me, and a legend arose of my cruelty to my stepson.}
<L>__{interior st. james day}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{my reception at court was scarcely more cordial. on paying my respects to my sovereign at st. james, his majesty pointedly asked me when i had news of lord brookside. on which i replied, with no ordinary presence of mind:}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{sire, my lord brookside has set sail to fight the rebels against your majesty's crown in america. does your majesty desire that i should send another company to aid him?}
<A>__{the king stares at roderick, turns on his heel and quickly leaves the presence chamber. roderick is approached by the duke of rutland, who takes him aside into an alcove.}
<C>__{duke of rutland}
<P>__{(speaking very quietly)}
<D>__{let me tell you, sir, that your conduct has been very odiously represented to the king, and has formed the subject of royal comment. the king has said, influenced by these representations, that you are the most disreputable man in the three kingdoms, and a dishonor to your name and country.}
<A>__{roderick begins to sputter.}
<C>__{duke of rutland}
<D>__{hear me out, please. it has been intimated to his majesty that you had raised the american company for the sole purpose of getting the young viscount to command it, and so get rid of him. and, further, that you had paid the very man in the company, who was ordered to dispatch him in the first general action.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{thus it is that my loyalty is rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor of my country viewed!}
<C>__{duke of rutland}
<D>__{as for your ambitious hopes regarding the irish peerages, his majesty has also let it be known that you have been led astray by that lord crabs, who likes to take money, but who has no more influence to get a coronet than to procure a pope's tiara. and, if you have it in mind to call upon lord crabs, you will be disappointed. he left for the continent on tuesday, and may be away for several months.}
