<LOC>__{INT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS}
<ACTION>__{We don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black. And maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely perceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed. BREATHING, slow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A feeling of utter loneliness. And now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it was...it's gone now.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MAIN CREDITS ROLL.}
<ACTION>__{We hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody. And now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally intricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers opening up in time lapse photography.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FRACTALS...}
<ACTION>__{is what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas. The Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of progressively smaller forms and on into infinity. Glorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and regenerating. This is creation we're witnessing. This is life in the making.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{AN EYE}
<ACTION>__{For a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue one.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye.}

<LOC>__{INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{This is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear Alex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is very bright and dreamlike. Right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway is an open door. We stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in.}
<CHAR>__{ALEX } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{It's strange.  When the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean, you never really get there.  It's always one step ahead of you.  It's like there's no present. There's no "now".  As soon as you think, "I'm here", the moment's already gone.  Either everything's in the future, or it's in the past.}

<LOC>__{INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Everything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases. Everything looks perfect. Then we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the floor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway out. It's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We can't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And all around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom and the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD. A shrill BELL shatters the moment.}

<LOC>__{INT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{The bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON ALEX}
<ACTION>__{as we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty, though in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense. If Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's reflected in her eyes. Across from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that was his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged, incapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office we're in. Typical "SAY NO TO DRUGS" teen propaganda decorate the room. Fun. As the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling in the halls. Alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.}

<LOC>__{INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Fun-time.  Total chaos.  If you've been to high-school you know the riff. Bad food, teen-age melodrama, and a squadron of SUPERVISORS trying to keep a lid on things.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ALEX}
<ACTION>__{makes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids lounge around a table.  These are Alex's FRIENDS.  And while none of them are your garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, these kids aren't exactly part of the "in-crowd".  They're a little off.  Quirky.  All of them come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them.  They are: GREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend.  Hopeful artist (not bad, either) and kind of punk looking.  Greg and the others are big fans of thrift-shop clothing.  Because they don't have the money, they improvise. NICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend and future computer pioneer.  He's attractive and he's got an edge.  A bit of a hot-shot.  Genius in the making. BENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable.  Benz is flunking out of school and would like nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic books.  He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous.  Stilts, contrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard. Stilts is constantly hitting on... LAURIE -- The sixth member of the group.  A teen Theda Bara and as cynical as you can get.  She's what's affectionately known as an "art chick". The boys in the group, particularly Nick and Stilts, are avid skateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards.  Stilts is always leafing through an issue of THRASHER magazine. Right now the group is in the midst of an argument.  Nick has a pocket video game in his hands which he casually plays.  He can get through these games in his sleep.  It BEEPS and WHIRS.}

<ACTION>__{Alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.}
<CHAR>__{GREG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{Alex shrugs, trying to make light of it.}
<CHAR>__{ALEX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{STILTS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.}
<ACTION>__{Greg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into exaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making "smooching faces" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS. Things are okay now.}
<CHAR>__{GREG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Alex)}
<DIAL>__{Hey...watch this...}
<ACTION>__{Greg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH! And the moment's captured forever. Greg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the emulsion.}

<DIAL>__{Lemme see...}
<ACTION>__{Greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz. The papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and Laurie lean in.}

<CHAR>__{NICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{GREG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.}

<ACTION>__{The Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because the games it sports are generally defective and out of date.  Nevertheless, it's become our group's hang-out.  It has its charms. A huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the arcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo. The yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.}

<ACTION>__{pull up across the street, caravan style.  Greg and Alex are in one car...an ancient Buick Skylark.  No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for this group.

Second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actual sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired directly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that he/she has actually entered the video game universe. Difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.}
