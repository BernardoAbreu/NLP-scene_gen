<C>__{golf channel announcer}
<D>__{from two fifty from a snarly lie, over water, on national tv, with no warmup... i'd give ten to one to a tour pro.}
<B>__{back to course}
<A>__{stadler, mccord, and mickelson are smiling at the bet. this is golf. but simms snarls at being challenged. stadler drops a ball in the rough for tin cup to hit.}
<C>__{stadler}
<D>__{here ya go. take a hack at it.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{balls versus brains, roy. you hit that shot, just keep walking, 'cuz your ass is fired.}
<A>__{tin cup mulls over the warning, as:}
<D>__{stadler, mccord, mickelson come on, roy! your fans are calling!}
<A>__{stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery. tin cup puts down simms's golf bag.}
<C>__{tin cup}

<A>__{gary mccord moves toward the camera and takes the microphone.}
<D>__{mccord peter, i've done a little background here this unfolding disaster's a driving range pro named roy mcavoy, who everyone calls tin cup. locals claim he he was a pretty good college lick and knocked around the mini tours...}
<A>__{tin cup steps up to hit the shot. mccord lowers his voice.}
<D>__{mccord ... but i guarantee you, he's about to suffer brain arrest. he's thinking about the cameras and the gallery and the water, and all that gray matter between his ears is turning to goo... and incidentally, stadler's got it booked at ten to one...}
<A>__{tin cup swings, and: the camera picks up the ball arching high and true off the club. it lands on the green. the crowd roars... and the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet from the pin.}

<P>__{definitely not that good... (etc.)}
<A>__{back to the course a scuffle's breaking out. david simms helping some guy over the gallery rope. simms walks the guy back to his golf bag... and now tin cup understands what's happening, and:}

<D>__{you can't fire me. how can you fire me? i just knocked it stiff from two fifty. gimme that bag.}

<C>__{simms}
<D>__{security!}
<A>__{tin cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals approaching. he turns his anger on simms.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what about my money?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{you just hit the shot that took you out of the money. welcome to life on the tour.}
<A>__{tin cup goes after the bag again. the guy still hangs on. the marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with tin cup. he goes berserk... a wwf battle royal.}
