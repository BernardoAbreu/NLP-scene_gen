<L>__{exterior arthur shaw n.y. campaign office late afternoon}
<A>__{through the windows see a crowded clutter of desks, phone volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. a giant secure tomorrow logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of robert arthur and raymond shaw. anderson comes out and opens the limo door for raymond. marco struggles out behind him:}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{am i in your dreams?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(evasive)}
<D>__{ you know.}
<A>__{raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{saving everybody?}
<A>__{pedestrians pass between them on the crowded sidewalk.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{it's more complicated than that.}
<A>__{marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of melvin's notebooks }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{people just don't have the same dreams accidentally }
<P>__{(holds out the notebook)}
<D>__{ melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed, this is one of his notebooks it's all in here.}
<A>__{ and raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it, the way marco once did with melvin. anderson and mirella the staffers in the office are all staring at marco the same way the boy scouts once stared at melvin.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i don't have dreams, captain.}
<P>__{(then, gently:)}
<D>__{maybe you should ... see somebody talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i've been to doctors.}
<A>__{... which is exactly what melvin said to him.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{okay. okay, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i'm not crazy, shaw.}
<A>__{he jams the notebook back into his folder, starts to walk away.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(calls after)}
<D>__{captain }
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{ major.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{ben.}
<A>__{marco stops, turns.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
