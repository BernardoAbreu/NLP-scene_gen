<L>__{exterior pond bluff road day}
<A>__{a dirt road runs along the edge of the santee swamps, stretching toward green, rolling hills beyond. beautiful country. peaceful. then, the ground begins to shake. a thunderous sound rises, louder and louder. horses hooves. from around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops: british green dragoons. the finest light calvary in the world. hard, strong men. excellent horsemen. their mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for. the dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with the blood and dirt of a recent battle. tired and vigorous. they're armed to the teeth. each carries a flintlock carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword. some carry lances as well. regimental flags flutter. they are forty of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable. and at their head, the most imposing man of all, lt. colonel banastre tarleton. "the butcher." aristocratic. strong. dark. a powerful horseman on the best mount of the entire troop. decorated. imperious. no temper, just hard, cold authority. his men struggle to keep up with him. behind them, two dozen loyalist militia calvary (american civilians loyal to the crown). nasty, local men. civilian clothes. riding at their head is amos gaskins, grizzled, lower class, wearing ill fitting patrician's clothing.}
<B>__{around a bend}
<A>__{the three wounded patriots who just left marion's farm hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road, raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender. the green dragoons rein in. tarleton stops in front of the three men. he motions for one of his men to lower his weapon. then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded men.}
