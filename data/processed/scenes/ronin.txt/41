<L>__{exterior the hills of nice morning}
<A>__{a private estate in the hills a caravan of black armor plated cars, all idling, ready to pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under their jackets, all of them waiting for the target. except we've seem him before and he wasn't called the target: he was the killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in the cathedral who made off with the briefcase. which the briefcase is still handcuffed to his side. now the target gets into his car, a black mercedes, and as soon as he's in the caravan pulls out and the target takes out his cell phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does we pull back, into the air, leaving the caravan behind as we move towards the water and the promenade des anglais, the long roadway that runs the length of the town adjacent to the beach. it's a special place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for tourists. here we come upon an outdoor cafe where we find deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a headset. and, lest we think she looks out of place, we get a look at the rest of the cafe where many of the other patrons are typing away on laptops, or chattering like crazy on their cell phone. she types a sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out loud.}
