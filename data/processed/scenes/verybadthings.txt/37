<T>__{music over series of shots:}
<A>__{moore and fisher scrub blood from the carpet. fisher keeps forgetting to breath. michael and boyd put tina and ralph in the bath tub. adam sits in shock on the floor. fisher and moore try to fix a broken chair. boyd starts to dismember ralph with the pruning shears, like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken. adam stares at the wall. michael wraps one of ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a suitcase. boyd saws. michael wraps. fisher and moore clean. adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help. until the last of the body parts, tina's head, is wrapped in plastic, packed in a suitcase. the bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. just a bit of blood left in the tub. boyd looks pleased.}
