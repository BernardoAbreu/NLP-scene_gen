<L>__{interior subaru (moving) day}
<A>__{kate cries as she drives. she glances in the backseat at all the baby shower gifts and sobs even harder.}
<L>__{interior dive bar day}
<A>__{kate walks into a near empty, depressing dive. she nervously sits at the bar. the bartender a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled up approaches.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{whiskey. double.}
<A>__{the bartender gives kate her drink. kate immediately downs it.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{can i have another one?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{sure you gotta pay for the first one, though. eight bucks.}
<A>__{kate puts a twenty dollar bill down. the bartender pours her another shot.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{kate has clearly been drinking for awhile she's curled up at the bar, nursing her beer.}
<C>__{bartender }
<D>__{look, miss i don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause i take it you've had a bad day, but um... i think you need to go home.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{cause you're pretty drunk and it's four p.m.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what about him?}
<A>__{kate points to an old crusty man at the other end of the bar.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{you're not kicking him out.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{i'm just trying to be a pal.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{stop it you aren't my pal. i just got fired, and i just quit aa.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it didn't work.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{oh, boy...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you know what? i was fine had a husband that loved me and maybe i sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i go to aa and sober my husband and i start fighting and stop fucking and sober i get fired! isn't that what's supposed to not happen?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{wow, okay, well...i'm real sorry. but this place gets a little nuts after sundown and i don't think a pretty girl who just left aa should be here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm gonna call you a cab.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no! i don't want a cab. i want }
<P>__{(glances around)}
<D>__{ drugs. can you hook me up?}
<A>__{the bartender rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{c'mon...let's go out back and smoke some crack.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{lady, you're done.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you think i'm above smoking crack? `cause i'm not. and are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?}
<A>__{kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" but she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{just a teensy bit...?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{not in the slightest.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `cause i'm a...a stone cold fox. and i'm smart. and i'm...}
<A>__{kate begins to cry.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{...a good person.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{i think it's time for you to go home. now are you gonna let me call a cab?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(suddenly angry)}
<D>__{no! i'm not. i've got friends. they'll pick me up.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you do that.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i will call mr. davies. he has dreams about me.}
<A>__{the bartender takes a long look at kate as though he's trying to size up if she's insane.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hope that works out for you.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{can't believe my luck. i just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{life is stupid.}
<A>__{kate stands up almost falling over and glares at the bartender.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{you hear me? life is fucking stupid!}
<A>__{kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at him, then picks up his drink and chugs it.}
