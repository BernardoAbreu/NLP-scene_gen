<A>__{szpilman watches from the doorway. then, dropping down, he crawls across the road on his stomach, threading his way through the dead bodies, now besieged by flies, and makes for the hospital opposite. german soldiers appear from around a corner. szpilman immediately lies still, pretending to be just another corpse. flies alight on him. when the germans pass, he sets off again.}
<L>__{interior ruined hospital, operating theatre night}
<A>__{dark. szpilman crawls into a corner, rests. he's exhausted. he tries to take stock of his surroundings. he can make out the operating table. he manages to drag himself on to it. he lies there, his eyes grow heavy. he sleeps.}
