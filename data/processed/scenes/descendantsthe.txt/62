<L>__{exterior brian speer's block kahala day}
<A>__{the car creeps down a street of lovely homes.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{do you know anything about him? like what he does or if he's married?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just his name. brian speer.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{why didn't you ask kai and mark?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i just didn't.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i didn't want to get into it.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{we'll google him later. okay, there it is. stop.}
<A>__{matt pulls over opposite a supremely average looking house.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{there? he lives there?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{well, i can't say for sure he lives there. that's just where i saw them.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and you just happened to be driving by.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{sadie was driving. we both saw it.}
<A>__{they all observe closely, very focused. nothing happens. it's just a house.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{that house is a piece of shit. at least go after a guy who's got a mansion. and do you think he's married? that'd be pretty cold blooded to do it in a house where you're married.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{sid, please be quiet.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm just showing you the house.}
<A>__{they all think a moment.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{should i go ring the bell?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(tempted, then )}
<D>__{no, wait, this is stupid this stalking, or whatever the hell we're doing. we came, we saw. whatever. let's go.}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{it's not like we're stalking him exactly.}
<A>__{a plumbing truck drives up the road. the three of them reflexively crouch down before catching themselves.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{what would you do if you saw him, anyway? talk to him or punch him or what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i guess i just want to see him.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{all i know is, someone messed with my girl, all hell would break loose.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{whatever, sid.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i mean, you'd never do that to me, would you? you know, if we ever got married. fuck around on me.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{depends on how you treated me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's enough now.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{and we're not getting married. jesus.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(starting the car)}
<D>__{okay, that's enough. we're getting out of here.}
