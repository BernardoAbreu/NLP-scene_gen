<L>__{exterior balcony, goeth's villa plaszow day}
<A>__{schindler and goeth on the balcony of the villa, drinking.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you want these people.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{these people, my people, i want my people.}
<A>__{goeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled. below them lies the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the shipments can be arranged.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{what are you, moses? what is this? where's the money in this? what's the scam?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{it's good business.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. you've got to move them, the equipment, everything to czechoslovakia it doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{look }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you're not telling me something.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{it's good for me i know them, i'm familiar with them. it's good for you you'll be compensated. it's good for the army. you know what i'm going to make?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{artillery shells. tank shells. they need that. everybody's happy.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<A>__{goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe. he's sure schindler's got something else going on here he's not telling him.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you're probably scamming me somehow. if i'm making a hundred, you got to be making three.}
<A>__{schindler admits it with a shrug.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{if you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. but how?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i just told you.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you did, but you didn't.}
<A>__{goeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face. he can't find it.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{yeah, all right, don't tell me, i will go along with it, it's just irritating to me i can't figure it out.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. what's a person worth to you.}
<A>__{goeth thinks about it in the silence. then a slow nod to himself. he's going to make some money out of this even if he can't figure it out. he smiles.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{what's one worth to you? that's the question.}
