<L>__{interior creasy's room night}
<A>__{as the song repeats, creasy chambers yet another round. feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into the chamber. pinta sings along oblivious. suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled. no gun shot. a click. hammer against shell. creasy is confused. he ejects the shell and catches it in the palm of his hand. macro photograph a small dimple on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his actions. pinta still dances.}
