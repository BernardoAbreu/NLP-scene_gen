<A>__{lisa walks into ward x. she looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment. overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping. as she edges through the hallway lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. she walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch. sliding it open lisa peers inside. in the centre of the floor she sees a needle, a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by six lit candles. she looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell. suddenly sadie jumps up right in front of the hatch! lisa falls backwards, letting out an involuntary scream! she stumbles to her feet as sadie laughs. lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit.}
