<A>__{jerry and tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level above the bright white lobby. maguire looks down at the scene. he breathes in the commotion. in another twelve hours, he will be at the very epicenter with cushman.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{i came all the way here for that? to walk the lobby?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah. and it might have even worked too.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{let's do it again.}
<A>__{jerry doesn't respond. down in the lobby, jerry catches a glimpse of a familiar looking agent. it's sugar. jerry is consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but tidwell continues talking.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you believe they're shooting a nike ad down there? did i ever tell you my nike story?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i gotta get back to cushman.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{okay, i understand. i will boil it down for ya. fuck nike. all they do is ignore me...}
<A>__{jerry turns to tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you know what was great about you down there? for about five minutes, you unloaded that rather expansive, let me just say "large" chip that resides right there on your shoulder, and you know what? you were brilliant. take care.}
<A>__{jerry starts to exit.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{you're loving me now, aren't ya?}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(mock serious)}
<D>__{i'm not about love i'm about "showing you the money."}
<A>__{tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{good. i was just testing ya.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but just you saying that? makes me love ya.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{get some sleep. see you tomorrow.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? i'm a very good singer, man }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{call me tomorrow.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{i might call you later!}
<A>__{tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk. a small pack of diehard jets fans pass, looking for autographs.}
