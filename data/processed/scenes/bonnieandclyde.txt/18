<L>__{exterior car. another angle. day.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back and above the car. the car starts to go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience just what is happening to the driver controlling it. the car swerves all over the road. the car comes to a sudden halt. the car starts again. it swerves this time almost right off the road before it straightens out. it jumps and jerks. another car comes down the road the other way and clyde's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive right off the road into the dirt. it is almost mack sennett stuff, but not quite that much.}
