<A>__{she careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man thundering after her. angle at the far end of the cellar. nancy brakes at the wall. nowhere left to hide. the scrapping of the blades against brick turns her to see the huge killer holding his knife laden fingers up for her.}
<C>__{krueger}
<D>__{ready for these?}
<A>__{on nancy she ducks behind the furnace comes out the other side with the big jug of gasoline and lets krueger have it straight over the head. the heavy container shatters, showering its contents over every square inch of the man. he staggers backwards with a roar of fury, nancy screaming after him with a box of kitchen matches. before the man can realize what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in krueger's face. there's a blinding whoosh and krueger goes up in a terrific ball of fire. faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling maniac and makes for the stairs, krueger after her in full pyrrhic rage.}
