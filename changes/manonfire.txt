<ACTION_ALT>__{OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE}
<LOC>__{EXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a Mass being sung.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A CATHOLIC CHURCH}
<ACTION>__{The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin. They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes}
<LOC>__{500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A GRAND MARQUIS}
<ACTION>__{Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff- arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins... The Grand Marquis pulls away.}
<LOC>__{INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. These guys are not the police. A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf. Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over from one group to the other.}
<LOC>__{INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers. REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin.}
<LOC>__{INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf. A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear scratched. At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO T:}
<ACTION>__{.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last two years."}
<LOC>__{EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)}
<ACTION>__{Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway. Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi- derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.}
<LOC>__{EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT}
<ACTION>__{RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median. HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median. The car pulls away. He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING for help. More horns, shouts, no help. END MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black.}

<LOC>__{INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40, already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations. They discuss the kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.}
<CHAR>__{JORDAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.}

<ACTION>__{Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:}
<CHAR>__{LISA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.}
<CHAR>__{SAMUEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{LISA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.}
<CHAR>__{SAMUEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Our daughter.}
<ACTION>__{She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese Checkers.}

<CHAR>__{LISA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.}
<ACTION>__{She just stares at him.    He melts.}
<TRANS>__{RETURN TO:}

<DIAL>__{For a year?}
<CHAR>__{JORDAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.}
<ACTION>__{Samuel finally follows the logic.}
<CHAR>__{SAMUEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening. The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a gunslinger. Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light). Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card. Light flashes RED.}

<DIAL>__{I cannot see your eyes, Senor.}
<ACTION>__{Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted. Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment. He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button. The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine. Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.}

JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels, glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of suitcase. The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.}

Quick and lithe.   Trying to reach her bodyguard. The cops drawing Uzi's.. Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest. Pinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN. COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten bullet line. Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high in the chest and throat. Precise. Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs. A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the Corolla. Creasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM! MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit in the shoulder. And Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone. MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again. Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He falls to his knees. The dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece by piece. Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans for Pinta who's nowhere in sight. She got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side.}
