<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i walked five steps today!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{congratulations. listen, franklin, i got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i'm hardly newsworthy these days.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how did he find out i'm here?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{small town word gets out. it probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the inn.}
<A>__{franklin looks at tom knowing full well he's arranged this.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{all right, i know the gentleman. i'm doing him a favor. you know, i used to be a journalist.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{do you mean all this time i've been talking to a newspaper man?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{not anymore. i got in a bit of trouble in atlanta. seems some of the editorial pieces i wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group. so i needed to lay low for a while.}
