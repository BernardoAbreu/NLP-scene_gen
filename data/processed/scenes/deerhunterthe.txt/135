<L>__{interior sal's house front parlor night}
<A>__{the room is very dark. angela sits at a lace covered table by the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie glow. angela holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to another. there is a sound from the hallway, then sal's mother comes in with nick.}
<C>__{sal's mother}
<D>__{i know i know you. so familiar. such a familiar face. oh, i know now! the toaster man! i will go and get it for you.}
<A>__{sal's mother goes out. angela lights up a cigarette.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you're back.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm glad. seriously... i'm very glad.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{angela, i just heard sal was alive.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{sure. why not.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{where? where is he?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{nick, he's fine. he's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you talk to him?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{oh, sure... twice a day.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what hospital is he in? where?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{nick... sal is very weak. he suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, angela, sal and i go back a long way.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{he doesn't want people bugging him, nick!}
<A>__{angela begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands up. she stares at nick for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. nick comes up behind her. angela finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall. nick tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{angela...?}
<A>__{angela laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding nick's eyes.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{did you ever think life would turn out like this?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you know what sal's got now?... sal's got... one arm, nick, and... that's it.}
<A>__{the door to the kitchen bangs open and sal's mother comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.}
<C>__{sal's mother}
<D>__{here. this is it. what you do, you stick this in here.}
<A>__{pushes the toaster in nick's arms.}
<C>__{sal's mother }
<D>__{then you jab it, see. jab it good. something's in it. hear? listen. something's in it. what? what's there?}
