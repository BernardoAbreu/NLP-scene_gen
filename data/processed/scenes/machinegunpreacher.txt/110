<A>__{what we're looking at is the modest beginning of the angels of east africa children's orphanage. a cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3 rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt sam first let trickle between his fingers. and we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo walls. acholi workers laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel. and we find sam with two or three small children who are crying for no apparent reason. he's on his knees, trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here. and now we see deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built ugandan woman in her late 40's.}
