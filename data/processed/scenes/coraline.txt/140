<L>__{exterior well same}
<A>__{coraline jams the same dead branch wybie used under the well's cover, lining it up over the same fulcrum rock.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{... but i never give you sandwiches with grease and worms and mung beans.}
<A>__{circling around behind the big stump, the hand scampers behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer. coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the whole well open. huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck. the hand, seeing what is about to happen, races towards her! coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head. the hand jumps onto the big stump and springs through the air to grab the key and pull coraline to the ground! coraline makes a choked scream, her fingers caught between the key string and her neck! the hand wants to drag her back to the house and the little locked door that is breathing with anticipation! a blinding headlight hits hand and coraline; an air horn sounds; and wybie lovat hollering a battle cry all his own comes speeding down the bluff on his whining electric bike!}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{yahhhhh!!!!}
<A>__{wybie guns the throttle, and, leaning out, grabs the confused hand with his slug tongs! he circles around and heads towards the well, readying to throw the hand in. but the hand gets free, and grabs his handlebars. out of control, wybie's bike hits a rock, and wybie and hand are thrown right down the well. hollering, he just manages to hang on with one hand! the beldam's hand, caught on wybie's coattail, scrambles up his body and face and onto the well's edge where it stabs at his fingers to make him fall!}
<C>__{wybie }
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{get off!!}
<A>__{coraline, choking, rises to her feet. she grabs her blanket and in the still blazing headlight of the crashed bike she runs up and throws it over the hand. it fights like crazy as coraline wrestles to control it. the hand stabs through the blanket and shakes it off. it crouches to attack her! and then wybie is back, pumped with adrenaline, a big rock raised over his head! he hurls it down on the leaping hand! and it breaks into twenty lifeless needles. wybie struggles to catch his breath. coraline breathing hard removes the key and string from around her sore neck. she pulls up the corners of her blanket with the needles on it around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. the key is left attached. the two friends carry the heavy package to the well and drop it down the hole. by the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom. they slide the well cover in place. still catching his breath, wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the beldam's claw. he looks over at coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{i i'm really sorry i didn't believe you about all this ... evil stuff, coraline.}
<A>__{coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath, stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the first time.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{why did you change your mind?}
<A>__{he walks over, and takes out an old b&w photo from his jacket.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{w well, gramma showed me this picture, after i called you crazy?}
<A>__{he hands it to her. angle on photo: two light skinned black girls dressed in old fashioned clothing stand in front of the pink palace, before it was divided into apartments. one looks just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the doll with button eyes, which looks just like her.}
<D>__{wybie (o.c.) (cont'd) it's her and her sister, before she disappeared.}
<A>__{angle on wybie and coraline. behind them, blossoms fall like snow in the orchard.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{the sweet ghost girl.}
<A>__{wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the distance.}
<C>__{wybie's grandmother }
<D>__{wyborne! come home!!}
<C>__{wybie}
<P>__{(re: his grandmother)}
<D>__{oh, man...what am i going to tell her?}
<A>__{she looks up from the photo and smiles.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{just bring her by the house tomorrow. we can tell her together.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{we...we can??}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{you know, i'm glad you decided to stalk me.}
<A>__{she gives wybie a playful punch on the arm and laughs.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{wasn't my idea.}
<A>__{the black cat jumps up on the tree stump and merowws. coraline smiles. we tilt up to the sky and see the last ropey clouds like two clawed hands clear away from the bright gibbous moon.}
