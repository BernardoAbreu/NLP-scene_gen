<L>__{interior northup house bedroom morning}
<A>__{it is a saturday morning. clad in her finest attire is anne; solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. we see also the northup children: margaret who is eight, and alonzo who is five. they are handsome, and well groomed kids. anne straightens up the children. she finishes, she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait. they all wait a moment, then solomon enters the foyer. he stands and looks admiringly at his family. admiringly stressed. it isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. but in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for. he goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to anne. gives her a kiss on the cheek. the children giggle at the sight.}
