<A>__{smash!!!! their car is smashed into a tailspin, by handsome bob's truck. the range rover eventually lands on it's side, steam, spinning wheels, smoke, and glass is everywhere.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway car waiting. we see one two and mumbles get out of their car and run over to the range rover on its side, they are carrying an axe and bolt cutters. inside, chechnyan 2 slowly opens his dazed eyes, to see an axe chopping through the window. two chops and the window gives in. one two leans in and grabs the case, but it's chained to chechnyan 2's wrist. one two pulls the arm out of the window and mumbles uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{there's another case, grab it.}
<A>__{one two leans in and grabs the second case from chechnyan 1. as he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the car by chechnyan 2.}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{the bastard's still kicking. mace him, mace him!}
<A>__{mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays mace everywhere, including into one two's eyes.}
<C>__{one two }
<D>__{yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot, the guerrilla!}
<A>__{chechnyan 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength and is still pulling one two into the car with him. we can see bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car looking concerned.}
<C>__{one two }
<D>__{shoot him, shoot him, the bastards going to eat me!}
<A>__{mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and fires it into chechnyan 2's leg. this just aggravates the}

<C>__{one two }
<D>__{in his arms!}
<A>__{bang.}
<C>__{one two }
<D>__{arhhhhhhhhhhh. that's my fuckin arm!}
<A>__{one two manages to head butt chechnyan 2 and goes back to reclaiming the case from chechnyan 1. he pulls it out and mumbles cuts the chain. one two can't see a thing.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{let's go, we've got it.}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{give me a hand, you've blinded me!}
<A>__{major confusion is setting in. they run back to their car, which is still running, mumbles shoves one two into the back and jumps in the drivers seat.}
<C>__{one two }
<D>__{go, go, go, go!!!!!!}
<A>__{with his window open, mumbles wheel spins out of the situation and turns to check on one two. from out of nowhere a very large chechnyan arm shoots through the window and puts mumbles in a neck lock. the chechnyan 2 is holding on and not letting go. the car tears across the road and enters a shop window that has a mezzanine. the car comes to a halt on a precarious ledge, it's dangling with the chechnyan 2 still not letting go.}
