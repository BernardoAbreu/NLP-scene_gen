<L>__{interior dining hall sarah siddons society night}
<A>__{it is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight. a long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. diner is over. demi tasses, cigars and brandy. the overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. it is june. the camera, as it has been throughout the credit titles, is on the sarah siddons award. it is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of sarah siddons as the tragic muse. exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor. over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise voice of addison dewitt:}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement is perhaps unknown to you. it has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable "honors" as the pulitzer prize and those awards presented annually by the film society...}
<A>__{the camera has eased back to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow white hair who is speaking. we do not hear what he says.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor. being an actor he will go on speaking for some time. it is not important what you hear what he says.}
<A>__{the camera eases back some more, and continues until it discloses a fairly comprehensive shot of the room}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{however it is important that you know where you are, and why you are here. this is the dining room of the sarah siddons society. the occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our theater knows the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement.}
<A>__{a group of waiters are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen. the screens are papered with old theatrical programs. the waiters are all aged and venerable. they look respectfully toward the speaker.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{these hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon modjeska, ada rehan and minnie fiske; mansfield's voice filled the room, booth breathed this air. it is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death.}
<A>__{close the award on its altar, it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented. minor awards are for such as the writer and director since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than eve harrington. eve... but more of eve, later. all about eve, in fact.}
<A>__{the camera moves to: close addison dewitt, not young, not unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and merciless of tongue. an omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of d'artagnan. he sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. his narration covers the move of the camera to him:}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{to those of you who do not read, attend the theater, listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of the world in which we live it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself. my name is addison dewitt. my native habitat is the theater in it i toil not, neither do i spin. i am a critic and commentator. i am essential to the theater as ants are to a picnic, as the ball weevil to a cotton field...}
<A>__{he looks to his left. karen richards is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way. she is scraping bread crumbs, spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. addison takes one of her bread crumbs. she smiles absently. addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{this is karen richards. she is the wife of a playwright, therefore of the theater by marriage. nothing in her background or breeding should have brought her any closer the stage than row e, center...}
<A>__{karen continues her doodling.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{... however, during her senior year in radcliffe, lloyd richards lectured on drama. the following year karen became mrs. lloyd richards. lloyd is the author of 'footsteps on the ceiling' the play which has won for eve harrington the sarah siddons award...}
<A>__{karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. a hand reaches in to take the spoon away. karen looks as the camera pans with it to max fabian. he sits at her left. he's a sad faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension. he smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps. he pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping. karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. addison mashes a cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. he eyes max.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{there are two types of theatrical producers. one has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss. this type is interested in art.}
<A>__{max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps delicately and close his eyes.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{the other is one to whom each production mean potential ruin or fortune. this type is out to make a buck. meet max fabian. he is the producer of the play which has won eve harrington the sarah siddons award...}
<A>__{max rests fitfully. he twitches. a hand reaches into the scene, removes a bottle of scotch from before him. the camera follows the bottle to margo channing. she sits at max's left, at dewitt's right. an attractive, strong face. she is childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable usually one when she should be the other, but always positive. she pours a stiff drink. addison hold out the soda bottle to her. she looks at it, and at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. he smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{margo channing is the star of the theater. she made her first stage appearance, at the age of four, in 'midsummer night's dream'. she played a fairy and entered quite unexpectedly stark naked. she has been a star ever since.}
<A>__{margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{margo is a great star. a true star. she never was or will be anything less or anything less...}
<P>__{(slight pause)}
<D>__{... the part for which eve harrington is receiving the sarah siddons award was intended originally for margo channing...}
<A>__{addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor. as he speaks the camera moves in the direction of his glance...}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the sarah siddons society, but also the history of acting since thespis first stepped out of the chorus line our distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here...}
<A>__{at this point addison's voice fades out and the voice of the aged actor fades in. camera is in medium close shot of him and the podium.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{i have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the theater "a poor player ... that struts and frets his hour upon the stage" and i have been honored to be, for forty years, chief promoter of the sarah siddons society...}
<P>__{(he lifts the sarah}
<D>__{siddons award from its}
<P>__{altar)}
<D>__{thirty nine times have i placed in deserving hands this highest honor the theater knows...}
<P>__{(he grows a bit arch, he uses his eyebrows)}
<D>__{surely no actor is older than i i have earned my place out of the sun...}
<P>__{(indulgent laughter)}
<D>__{... and never before has this award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight. how fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers...}
<A>__{eve hands: lovely, beautifully groomed. in serene repose, they rest between a demi tasse cup and an exquisite small evening cup.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{such young hands. such a young lady. young in years, but whose heart is as old as the theater...}
<A>__{addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. then, slowly, he turns to look at karen...}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{some of us a privileged to know her. we have seen beyond the beauty and artistry }
<A>__{karen never ceases her thoughtful pat a cake with the crumbs.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{ that have made her name resound through the nation. we know her humility. her devotion, her loyalty to her art.}
<A>__{addison's glance moves from karen to margo.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{her love, her deep and abiding love for us }
<A>__{margo's face is a mask. she looks down at the drink which she cradles with both hands.}
<C>__{aged actor}
<D>__{ for what we are and what we do. the theater. she has had one wish, one prayer, one dream. to belong to us.}
<P>__{(he's nearing his curtain line)}
<D>__{tonight her dream has come true. and henceforth we shall dream the same of her.}
<P>__{(a slight pause)}
<D>__{honored members, ladies and gentlemen for distinguished achievement in the theater the sarah siddons award to miss eve harrington.}
<A>__{the entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause. some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet... flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the aged actor's left... eve rises beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned. she stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. a dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water bugs. flash bulbs pop and pop and pop... the waiters applaud enthusiastically... aged actor, award in hand, he beams at her... eve smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right... max has come to. he applauds lustily. addison's applauding too, more discreetly. margo, not applauding. but you sense no deliberate slight, merely an impression that as she looks at eve her mind is on something else... karen, nor is she applauding. but her gaze is similarly fixed on eve in a strange, faraway fashion. addison, still applauding, his eyes flash first at margo and then at karen. then he directs them back to eve. he smiles ever so slightly. the applause has continued unabated. eve turns now, and moves gracefully toward the aged actor. she moves through applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs keep popping... as she nears her goal, the ages actor turns to her. he holds out the award. her hand reaches out for it. at that precise moment with the award just beyond her fingertips the picture holds, the action stops. the sound stops.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{eve. eve, the golden girl. the cover girl, the girl next door, the girl on the moon... time has been good to eve, life goes where she goes she's been profiled, covered, revealed, reported, what she eats and when and where, whom she knows and where she was and when and where she's going...}
<A>__{addison has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring intently at eve... his narration continues unbroken.}
<C>__{addison's voice}
<D>__{... eve. you all know all about eve... what can there be to know that you don't know...?}
<A>__{as he leans back, the applause fades in as tumultuous as before. addison's look moves slowly from eve to karen. karen, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on eve. her lovely face fills the screen as the applause fades once more as she thinks back:}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{when was it? how long? it seems a lifetime ago. lloyd always said that in the theater a lifetime was a season, and a season a lifetime. it's june now. that was early october... only last october. it was a drizzly night, i remember i asked the taxi to wait...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior new york theater street night}
<A>__{traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half hour before. the rain is just a drizzle. there are other theaters on the street; display lights are being extinguished. going out just as karen's taxi pulls up is: margo channing in 'aged in wood'. the marquis display below includes "max fabian presents" and "by lloyd richards." the taxi comes to a stop at the alley. karen can be seen through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. then she gets out. she takes a step, hesitates, then looks about curiously:}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{where was she? strange... i had become so accustomed to seeing her there night after night i found myself looking for a girl i'd never spoken to, wondering where she was...}
<A>__{she smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head down and makes her way into the alley.}
<L>__{exterior alley curran theater night}
<A>__{karen moves toward the stage door. she passes a recess in the wall perhaps an exit about halfway.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{mrs. richards...}
<A>__{karen hesitates, looks. eve is barely distinguishable in the shadow of the recess. karen smiles, waits. eve comes out. a gooseneck light above them reveals her... she wears a cheap trench coat, low heeled shoes, a rain hat stuck on the back of her head... her large, luminous eyes seem to glow up at karen in the strange half light.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so there you are. it seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{why should you think i wouldn't be?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why should you be? after all, six nights a week for weeks of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater }

<D>__{not at all.}

<A>__{the same night as the previous sequence, but before the party has started. margo is all dressed except for jewelry. she stands before her dressing table putting it on. she sips at an enormous martini...}

<A>__{birdie comes in.}

<C>__{eve}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...}

<D>__{it's a pretty rare quality these days.}
<C>__{margo}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so she seems.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(the steel begins to flash)}
<D>__{so you've pointed out, so often. so many qualities, so often. her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection and so young. so young and so fair...}
<A>__{bill catches the drift. incredulously.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i can't believe you're making this up it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{clyde fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't think that's funny!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{of course it's funny this is all too laughable to be anything else. you know what i think about this this age obsession of yours and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stage struck kid }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{twenty minutes!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{thirty minutes, forty minutes! what of it?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{stage struck kid... she's a young lady of qualities. and i will have you know i'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! studying me as if as if i were a play or a set of blueprints! how i walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{stop calling her a kid! it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{for instance what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{for instance you!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you but i'm not going to. i'm too mad }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{ guilty.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mad! darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous on stage and off. i love you for some of them and in spite of others. i haven't let those become too important to me. they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment you've got to keep your teeth sharp. all right. but you will not sharpen them on me or on eve...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what about her teeth? what about her fangs?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy eyed kid by the barroom, benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society i won't have it! eve harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{cut! print it! what happens in the next reel? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{miss channing?}
<A>__{bill and margo look off. eve is in the room. they have no way of knowing how long she's been there.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the hors d'oeuvres are here. is there anything else i can do?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{thank you, eve. i'd like a martini very dry.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<P>__{(he crosses to eve)}
<D>__{what'll you have?}
<A>__{eve, involuntarily, looks to margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a milkshake?}
<A>__{eve smiles, turns to bill.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{a martini. very dry, please...}
<A>__{bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry. as he crosses the stairs, karen, lloyd and max come up from the street level below. general greetings. bill continues up to pantry. eve and then margo come up to add their welcome...}

<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{may i have your coat?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't bother, i can take it up myself...}
<C>__{eve}

<D>__{i like that girl. that quality of quiet graciousness...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... among so many quiet qualities.}
<A>__{they start for the living room.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm so happy you're happy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{look, you haven't been running a settlement house exactly the kid's earned her way. you had a pretty mixed up inventory when she took over merchandise laying all over the shop...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you've got margo mixed up with a five and ten cent store...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{make it bergdorf goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, max? done up in little ribbons. i could die right now and nobody'd be confused. how about you, max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how about me what?}
<A>__{they've come to a halt near the fireplace.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{supposed you dropped dead. what about your inventory?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i ain't gonna die. not with a hit.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is the most ghoulish conversation...}
<A>__{bill brings two martinis. he hands one to margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(it drips ice)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nothing, really...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{the kid junior, that is will be right down. unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...}

<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i can always get a fresh one. karen you're a gibson girl...}
<A>__{he hands eve's drink to karen. max has wandered off. other guests are arriving. margo gulps her drink, hands bill the empty glass. he puts it on a passing tray. margo takes a fresh one at the same time.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{the general atmosphere is very macbethish. what has or is about to happen?}

<A>__{margo surveys them all.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{fasten your seat belts. it's going to be a bumpy night.}
<A>__{she downs the drink, hands the empty glass to bill, and leaves them. she passes two women, gabbing by the piano. as they see her:}
<D>__{woman #1 margo, darling! woman #2 darling!}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(passing)}
<D>__{darlings...}
<A>__{she arrives at the landing just as addison comes up with miss caswell. margo takes a drink from a passing tray.}

<C>__{addison}
<D>__{dear margo. you were an unforgettable peter pan you must play it again, soon. you remember miss caswell?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i do not. how do you do?}

<D>__{we never met. that's why.}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you've heard of her great interest in the theater }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we have that in common.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{then you two must have a long talk }
<C>__{eve}

<A>__{it's many martinis later. most of the guests have gone. the party has reached that static state everyone's assumed more or less permanent places. birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. camera follows her to the piano where margo sits on the bench beside the pianist. he is just finishing "liebestraum" and she stares moodily into a martini. birdie halts beside her with the coffee. margo looks up. birdie holds out the coffee. margo takes the onion out of the martini, drops it into the coffee and waves birdie away. birdie goes. "liebestraum" comes to an end. the pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated rhythm. margo stops him.}

<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{it seemed to me i had known always that it would happen and here it was. it felt helpless, that helplessness you feel when you have no talent to offer outside of loving your husband. how could i compete? everything lloyd loved about me, he had gotten used to long ago...}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what would you do if, instead of eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical?}

<D>__{lloyd, i don't want you to go!}

<P>__{(increasingly tense)}
<D>__{was the setting properly romantic the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?}
<C>__{eve}

<C>__{addison}
<D>__{very well, plainly and distinctly. although i consider it unnecessary because you know as well as i, what i am about to say.}
<P>__{(they are now facing each other)}
<D>__{lloyd may leave karen, but he will not leave karen for you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{more plainly and more distinctly? i have not come to new haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale! i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd or anyone else because i will not permit it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what have you got to do with it?}

<D>__{everything. because after tonight, you will belong to me.}

<C>__{addison}
<D>__{a matter of opinion. granted. it is also true that you worked in a brewery. but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. as a matter of fact, it got less and less dull until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!}

<D>__{i'm giving her a very high class party. it ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{as soon as the peasants stop pawing her.}
<A>__{max hurries out. margo and bill step into the shot. eve turns from a well wisher to face her.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... nice speech, eve. but i wouldn't worry too much about your heart. you can always put that award where your heart ought to be.}
<A>__{eve looks at her wordlessly. margo and bill leave. addison and eve are alone. the tables about them are empty. suddenly, her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances at the table.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't suppose there's a drink left...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you can have one at max's.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{i don't think i'm going.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{because i don't want to.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<P>__{(she holds up the award)}
<D>__{it's for this.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it's the same thing, isn't it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(she gives him the award)}
<D>__{here. take it to the party instead of me.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you're being childish.}
<A>__{a well wisher rushes up to eve with an "eve, darling, i'm so happy!" eve rises, thanks her graciously. then she pulls her wrap over her shoulder.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm tired. i want to go home.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{very well. i shall drop you and go on to the party. i have no intention of missing it...}
<A>__{they exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables, waiters, and the usual banquet debris.}
<L>__{exterior park avenue night}
<A>__{eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment hotel. she doesn't say good night to addison, she enters the hotel as the cab drives off. she hasn't the award with her.}
<L>__{interior corridor outside eve's apartment night}
<A>__{smart, but not gaudy. eve crosses from the elevator to her apartment. she lets herself in.}
<L>__{interior eve's hotel apartment night}
<A>__{a small foyer, from which one door leads to the leaving room, another to the bedroom. the bedroom and living room do not connect except through the foyer. all the lights are out. eve turns them on in the foyer, the same as she enters the bedroom. there are some new trunks, in various stages of being packed. eve tosses her wrap on the bed, goes through the foyer to the living room. she turns on the light in the living room. camera follows her to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink. as she turns from the bar, she stares starts in fright and drops the drink. a young girl, asleep in a chair, wakes with a jump. she stares at eve, horror stricken.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{miss harrington...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i i guess i fell asleep.}
<A>__{eve starts for the phone. the girl rises in panic.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{please don't have me arrested, please! i didn't steal anything you can search me!}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{how did you get in here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. she must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. i sneaked in and hid till she finished. then i just looked around and pretty soon i was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off and then i guess, i fell asleep.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you were just looking around...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's all.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you probably won't believe me.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{probably not.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it was for my report.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what report? to whom?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{about how you live, what kind of clothes you wear what kind of perfume and books things like that. you know the eve harrington clubs that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've heard of them.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{ours was one of the first. erasmus hall. i'm the president.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{erasmus hall. that's in brooklyn, isn't it?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{lots of actresses come from brooklyn. barbara stanwyck, susan hayward of course, they're just movie stars.}
<A>__{eve makes no comment. she lies wearily on the couch.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you're going to hollywood aren't you?}
<P>__{(eve murmurs "uh huh")}
<D>__{from the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i might.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.}
<A>__{she crosses to it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the maid'll fix it in the morning.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i will just pick up the broken glass.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{don't bother.}
<A>__{the girl puts the broken glass on the bar. she starts to mix eve a fresh drink.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{how'd you get all the way up here from brooklyn?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{subway.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{how long does it take?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{with changing and everything, a little over an hour.}
<A>__{she carries the drink over to eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it's after one now. you won't get home till all hours.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't care if i never get home.}
<A>__{the door buzzer sounds.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's the door.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you rest. i will get it...}
<A>__{she goes to the door, opens it. addison stands there, the sarah siddons award in his hands.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{hello, there. who are you?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(shyly)}
<D>__{miss harrington's resting, mr. dewitt. she asked me to see who it is...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we won't disturb her rest. it seems she left her award in the taxicab. will you give it to her?}
<A>__{she holds it as if it were the promised land. addison smiles faintly. he knows the look.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{how do you know my name?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's a very famous name, mr. dewitt.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{and what is your name?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{phoebe.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{phoebe?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(stubbornly)}
<D>__{i call myself phoebe.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{why not? tell me, phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?}
<A>__{phoebe lifts her eyes to him.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{more than anything else in the world.}
<A>__{addison pats her shoulder lightly.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{then you must miss harrington how to get one. miss harrington knows all about it...}
<A>__{phoebe smiles shyly. addison closes the door. phoebe stares down at the award for an instant.}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<P>__{(sleepy; from the living room)}
<D>__{who was it?}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{just a taxi driver, miss harrington. you left the award in his cab and he brought it back...}
<C>__{eve's voice}
<D>__{oh. put it on one of the trunks, will you? i want to pack it...}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{sure, miss harrington...}
<A>__{she takes the award into the bedroom, sets it on a trunk. as she starts out, she sees eve's fabulous wrap on the bed. she listens. then, quietly, she puts on the wrap and picks up the award. slowly, she walks to a large three mirrored cheval. with grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her, and bows again and again... as if to the applause of a multitude.}
