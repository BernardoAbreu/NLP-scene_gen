<A>__{a giggling rose stumbles in. she stops. the bathroom door is open slightly. she walks over peeks through the opening. there's a dress crumpled on the floor. a woman slumps motionless in the tub. her delicate hand hangs over the edge. scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain. norah enters the front door. she smiles, unburdened by the knowledge. she runs towards rose. rose quickly pushes her back and closes the door. norah senses something's wrong. she struggles to see what's behind the door but rose won't let go.}
