<L>__{exterior stream through woods evening}
<A>__{she steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream below. she stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed clutching the toolbox. the water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds like glass breaking. the ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered for all time. she's talking to herself in a whisper.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{all she knows is that she just killed a boy. it may have been in self defense but she killed him.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{i'm so sorry!}
<A>__{the grief overcomes her silently. her face crumples. her stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body. a grief so deep tears would be a relief.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{where are you, god?}
<A>__{she falls to her knees in the stream. holding herself and rocking. the freezing water seeps up into her clothes, her hair.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{please, i just want to see my babies again.}
<A>__{her rocking slows until it stops. there's a loud crunch close by. she rises reflexively from the stream. raises the toolbox. she looks around. a branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her. this seems to bring her back to herself. she realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. she needs to get moving. she sets off downstream. she trudges through the shallow water. her wet coat drags heavily. the stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods. she trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. forging ahead. she now needs to pee. great. her temper surges up. she looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed. a leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. she makes her way toward it. she lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. we see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. we hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream. more glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat. she hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox. she plows down stream once more. longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home. she swallows another wave of grief. the stream loops around ahead then splits into two. she follows it, picks the left fork. and then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her. she doesn't even turn to see them. just runs. runs for her life. the glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. freezing water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. her feet slip and slide over wet rocks. but she keeps running. vinh's behind her. she can feel his breath, the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses. she runs even faster. she leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. they leap behind her. she pushes through the hanging branches of several trees. pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes, right into vinh's face. he tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. he cries out, covers his eyes.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{aaaarrhh.}
<A>__{this buys her a moment or two to get ahead. the stream bends right ahead. she opts to stay in it. chuckie leaps out, runs along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her. but the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. he leaps back across the stream to the other side. but she's outrunning him. he charges back into the stream behind her. della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction. vinh catches up with chuckie. the boys are maybe twenty five feet behind her. a shot rings out. then a bullet races past her ear. lodges in a tree just ahead of her. she almost loses her footing. she'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun. another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. she flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever. the stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. for just a moment she's invisible to them. she uses it. when she reaches the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.}
