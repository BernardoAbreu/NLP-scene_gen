<L>__{exterior highway, rural vermont, winter, day}
<A>__{as starks works on their engine, jackie anxiously watches her mother throw up in the distance. starks sees her watching and tries to distract her.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what do you think of all this snow?}
<A>__{jackie looks at him curiously.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{[beat] nothing.}
<A>__{starks looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; jackie turns her head back towards her mother.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but i like it i guess.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{hey, can you reach the gas pedal?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jackie gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just enough so her foot reaches the pedal.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{go ahead, turn it on. keep pushing it.}
<A>__{jackie revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters later, the car settles into a nice, working hum.}
<D>__{jackie [smiling] it works!}
<A>__{jackie steps down. she looks like she could hug starks and, unexpectedly, decides to. as starks awkwardly returns it, he sees jean lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{get your fucking hands off my daughter!}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mom, he just fixed our car.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{jackie, get in the car. now!}
<A>__{jean reaches for a rifle in the back of the truck but stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{look, i don't want any trouble, so...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{neither do i, ma'am. i will be on my way.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mom, you've got it wrong...}
<A>__{starks motions for jackie to stop as he collects his bags.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're just gonna walk?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, i will hitch a ride or something. [beat] let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.}
<A>__{starks' dog tags are tied to the zipper of one of his bags.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what're those?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{dog tags. [off her blank look] they've got your name and date of birth for identification.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] in case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. jackie [still looking at them] hm.}
<A>__{starks unties them and gives them to her. she reads them.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i think i can remember what's on them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{william starks. [beat] thanks.}
