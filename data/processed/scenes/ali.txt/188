<A>__{bundini's in ali's corner. ali's sparring partner is larry holmes. ali's hands are at his side. he dances, bicycles, shuffles, dances, dodges, doesn't throw anything, his elbows at his side. ali is training to dance from foreman. he's fast, but not seemingly suspended in air as he was 10 long years ago against liston.}
