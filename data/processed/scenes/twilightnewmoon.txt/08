<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(holds up her own camera)}

<A>__{jessica scoffs, angela points her camera at bella; mike and eric joust bella aims full frame the camera's digital screen it freezes on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they see someone behind bella. she turns to see edward climbing out of his silver volvo.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{oh good. cullen's here.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(drier)}
<D>__{yay.}
<A>__{the friends, uncomfortable, move off }
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{check ya later.}
<A>__{ but bella doesn't register their tone. she's transfixed by edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. he reaches her, washing away all her concerns }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{happy birthday.}
<A>__{ except that one. her face falls.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{don't remind me.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{your birth is definitely a day to celebrate.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{not for me.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it's one year older than you.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{bella, i'm ninety.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{true. maybe i should be creeped out that i'm dating such an old guy.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(smiles, amused)}
<D>__{yes, it's the age that's creepy, not the fact that you're dating a vampire.}
<A>__{then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. she kisses him back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until he pulls away. as always, both are left wanting more. edward nods toward the school building }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{class.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{right. class.}
<A>__{catching their breath, they start toward school... but edward stops, hearing something in his mind. irritated.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{someone wants you.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{bella!}
<A>__{jacob black, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging. he looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt. he nods to edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{god, jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? you're huge.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i will, soon. but isn't your school, like, ten miles that way?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(re: car part)}
<D>__{just here buying this for the rabbit. i'm almost done with the rebuild. gotta come take a ride when it's done.}
<P>__{(as if remembering)}
<D>__{oh, and hey, happy birthday. your dad told my dad. so...}
<A>__{he pulls from his coat a small woven dreamcatcher, feathers dangling from it. he hands it to her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i saw it the other day and thought of you it catches bad dreams.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{this, i need. it's great.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the bell's about to ring.}
<A>__{the bell rings. jacob gives edward an amiable smile, with just a hint of snark.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{ooh, look at you, all psychic.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i don't have that particular gift. but i can read a watch. i'm clever that way.}
<A>__{they share a tight smile. bella intercedes, squeezing jacob's arm.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{bye, jake, and thank you.}
<A>__{edward guides her away. as they walk off }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how come jacob black gets to give you a gift and i don't?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{he's just a friend.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{"friends" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{little hard to tune out.}
<A>__{she just laughs, but edward looks back at jacob with resentment. jacob holds his gaze.}
