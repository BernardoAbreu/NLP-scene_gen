<ACTION>__{Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten, history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN. His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered sign: "The Great Salt Lake Marina." They start down a slope and begin to cross a...}

<DIAL>__{The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death.}

<ACTION>__{A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run. Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again. TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as -- MAN'S FOOTPRINTS These tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS. A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low, disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner plans -- for now.}

The rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole and continues. BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:}

Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked, The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks his body. He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter. An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road.    Square.   He cautiously pulls back a few branches. An old, rusted Jeep with faded    U.S. government markings. Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide. The Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window, comes face-to-face with death.     A skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman. But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull. A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider- webbed safety glass and climbs inside.}

A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside. A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He takes a long, hard swallow.

Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look. The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes. It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter. Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches. One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise. It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other.}
