<L>__{interior lothos' cave closeup of cassandra's face}
<A>__{she is waking up, obviously from being knocked out. she blinks stupidly, looks around. she is lying by a pool of what looks to be dark water in a large cave. torches burn around her. she tries to get up and finds it difficult. she pulls herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face. it's blood. she starts, staring with growing horror at her hands. she does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first. it's lothos. he wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, the style maybe nineteenth century. no blood seems to touch him as he rises. he looks at cassandra with an almost sleepy lust.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{i find it restorative, sleeping in the life blood of so many. to feel their souls coursing about me.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{what's happening? what do you want?}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{so very much.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{my parents have money...}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure they do. this place is everything you said it was, amilyn.}
<A>__{cassandra turns. amilyn stands behind her, grinning. he hisses, bares his fangs at cassandra.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{what... are you?}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{are we so strange? so alien to you? i've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming. the perfect place to spread my empire. honestly, eastern europe was so dead, the communists just drained the blood out of the place. it's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this mecca of consumption. the city of angels.}
<A>__{he steps right up to her.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what are we? we are man, perfected. we exist to consume.}
<A>__{on the world "to consume" we see amilyn mouthing the words with lothos, his eyes to the ceiling. he's heard this a hundred times.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{so? do we change this one, or do we just drain her?}
<A>__{cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{here, look. my gold card. it's your. i will never report it.}
<A>__{amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{she has a certain quality, this one...}
<A>__{amilyn bites the card.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{i don't think this is gold.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{not as single minded as the others, not as sybaritic. almost thoughtful. she's useless.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{no, wait. i can be dumb. really. or mean, or whatever. i can learn. i'm useful.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{swear to god.}
<A>__{he rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies. he hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{i wish you wouldn't mention him...}
<A>__{slowly cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over. as she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "hemery high school. maintenance only."}
