<D>__{isn't mr. lowery back from lunch?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(a high, bright, eager }
<D>__{to talk voice laced to with a vague texan}
<P>__{accent)}
<D>__{he's lunching with the man who's buying the harris street property, you know, that oil lease man... so that's why he's late.}
<P>__{(a pause, then, as}
<D>__{mary does not respond}
<P>__{to the pointed thrust)}
<D>__{you getting a headache?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it'll pass. headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but}
<P>__{(cheerfully takes}
<D>__{bottle of pills out}
<P>__{of desk drawer)}
<D>__{my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{teddy was furious when he found out i'd taken tranquilizers!}
<A>__{she rises, starts for mary's desk, pills in hand.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{were there any calls?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{teddy called. me... and my mother called to see if teddy called. oh, and your sister called to say she's going to tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...}
<A>__{she breaks off, distracted by the sound of the door opening. mr. lowery and his oil lease client, tom cassidy enter the office. lowery is a pleasant, worried faced man, big and a trifle pompous. cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch hour load on. he is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{wow! hot as fresh milk! you girls should get your boss to air condition you up. he can afford it today.}
<A>__{lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at mary, tries to lead cassidy toward the private office.}
<C>__{lowery}
<D>__{mary, will you get those copies of the deed ready for mr. cassidy.}
<A>__{cassidy pauses beside mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at mary.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{tomorrow's the day! my sweet little girl...}
<P>__{(laughs as mary looks up at him)}
<D>__{not you, my daughter! a baby, and tomorrow she stands up there and gets her sweet self married away from me!}
<P>__{(pulling out wallet)}
<D>__{i want you to look at my baby. eighteen years old... and she's never had an unhappy day in any one of those years!}
<P>__{(flashes photo)}
<A>__{mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore the man's hot breath closeness.}
<C>__{lowery}
<D>__{come on, tom, my office is air conditioned.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(ignoring lowery)}
<D>__{you know what i do with unhappiness? i buy it off! you unhappy?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{not inordinately.}
<P>__{(puts deed copy into}
<D>__{cassidy's too close}
<P>__{hand)}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present. forty thousand dollars, cash! now that ain't buying happiness, that's buying off unhappiness! that penniless punk she's marryin'...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{probably a good kid... it's just that i hate him.}
<P>__{(looks at deed)}
<D>__{yup! forty thousand, says here...}
<P>__{(to lowery)}
<D>__{casharoonie!}
<A>__{he takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under mary's nose. caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. cassidy leans terribly close to mary, flicks through the bills, laughs wickedly.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i never carry more than i can afford to lose!}
<P>__{(closer to mary)}
<D>__{count 'em!}
<C>__{lowery}
<P>__{(shocked, worried)}
<D>__{tom... cash transactions of this size! most irregular...}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{so what? it's my private money!}
<P>__{(laughs, winks, elbows lowery)}
<D>__{and now it's yours.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(staring at the money)}
<D>__{i declare!}
<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i don't! that's how i'm able to keep it!}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<C>__{lowery}
<P>__{(hastily interrupting)}
<D>__{suppose we just put this in the safe and then monday morning when you're feeling good...}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{speakin' of feeling good, where's that bottle you said you had in your desk...}
<P>__{(laughs, as if having}
<D>__{given away lowery's}
<P>__{secret)}
<D>__{oops!}
<P>__{(to mary, patting her arm)}
<D>__{usually i can keep my mouth shut!}
<A>__{he rises, reels toward lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to mary, meaningfully.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{honest. i can keep any private transaction a secret... any pri....}
<P>__{(stopped by mary's cold gaze)}
<D>__{lowery! i'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!}
<A>__{lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to mary. cassidy has gone into lower's office.}
<C>__{lowery}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i don't even want it in the office over the weekend. put it in the safe deposit box, at the bank, mary. and we'll get him to give us a check on monday instead.}
<A>__{he starts quickly away when it looks like cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office. when the men are gone and the door is closed, caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he was flirting with you. i guess he noticed my wedding ring.}
<A>__{mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from caroline. when the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as:}
<C>__{lowery }
<D>__{come in.}
