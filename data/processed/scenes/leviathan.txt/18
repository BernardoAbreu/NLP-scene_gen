<L>__{interior corridor "b" later}
<A>__{dressed in their rubber latex suits cobb, jones, dejesus, beck, and willie carry the body of sixpack and bowman in the zippered bodybag. now, well over three hundred pounds, the bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to transport.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{c'mon, cobb...you're slacking...}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i ain't, goddamnit...it's jones!..}
<A>__{before jones can argue, beck cuts them off.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{shut up, all of you.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mr. beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck the contract, man!}
<A>__{the group turns into the swamp where doc waits for them by the lift lock. rounding the corner cobb bangs into the side of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package." like dominoes, willie also looses her grip, then dejesus. the bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even harder for everyone to get a handhold.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon...lift!}
<A>__{the group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on dejesus's face.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{hey!...i feel something. it's moving! he's alive!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i feel it, too...someone's trying to get out.}
<A>__{cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for the zipper.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{cobb, what're you doing!}
<C>__{cobs}
<D>__{but he ain't dead! he ain't dead.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{cobb! stop!}
<A>__{but cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag. beck tries to stop him when suddenly, wham! a dark appendage rips through the zipper and flails like a pressurized firehose. it beats wildly for several second, then lashes out at cobb ripping a gash on his forearm. while cobb screams in pain, beck yanks the appendage off cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a sharp tongue like proboscis which has stabbed cobb like a dagger.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it bit me! it bit me!}
<A>__{while beck and willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage, doc rushes to the lift lock. dejesus and jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag into the lift lock.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{push hazy!}
<A>__{the bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its occupant. jones digs his shoulder down into the task just as the bag suddenly rips in several places. a tear rips open next to jones' head revealing the head of bowman, her vacant eyes only inches from jones' face.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{oh, jesus christ! i ain't never gonna sleep again!}
<A>__{suddenly a whining noise sounds behind them. beck looks back to see cobb approaching with a battery operated underwater chain saw. he's clearly intending to cut the creature with the whirring blade.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it bit me!}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{it's sixpack!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i'm going to kill it!}
<A>__{dejesus turns to block cobb while the others continue to wrestle the bodybag into the lift lock. the bag suddenly splits and a scaly arm protrudes. it reaches out grabbing dejesus. beck pulls him free and yells.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{close the lock! now!}
<A>__{doc hits the lever. the elevator doesn't move! rrrrrriiiiippp! a scaly leg rips out of the body bag!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{hit it again!}
<A>__{doc hits the elevator switch again, harder. nnnnnnn! the lift lock door whines closed and a horrifying scream rises from the lock.}
<B>__{close on the lift lock}
<A>__{the end of the appendage is severed in the closing door, disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{flush it!}
<A>__{doc flips a switch and the scream of the vacuum pumps drown out the scream in the lift lock, the wails of cobb, and the splashing sounds of the severed three foot section of gory muscle which slip silently and undetected under the workbench. a second later the elevator returns empty, silent, bloodstained. beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior lock. the exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of the shack lights...into the darkness. beck turns and looks at his savaged crew. willie, jones, dejesus, doc look like wet suited butchers. splattered in blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together by having simply survived. jones holds up willie. dejesus leans against the bulkhead. in the far corner cobb sobs quietly. showers later clouds of steam. vaguely seen through the steam, willie is scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her skin. finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her head against the wall of the shower stall. dormitory same beck and jones open the privacy door to sixpack's bunk. after some digging which produces five month's supply of pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor. beck picks it up.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i think we just found our problem.}
<A>__{mess later cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand. jones, and dejesus sit at a table and willie laces up her shoes for a run. there is a feeling of anger among them.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{serves his ass right to get it. motherfucker brings that shit onboard. i hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{'fucker could have gotten us all killed.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{he knew better than that.}
<A>__{willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all coldly.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka...it could have been you.}
<A>__{she gets up and walks out into the ring corridor.}
<B>__{the russian ship}
<A>__{we are moving along the ship's corridor that willie walked looking for sixpack.}
<B>__{we pull back to reveal we are watching a video screen in the control room}
<A>__{doc and beck replay the tape of willie's search for sixpack on the russian ship. on the monitor screen we see willie's pov of the infirmary. the light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{hold it! rewind it.}
<A>__{beck rewinds it. on screen we see the scene again. light dancing off the cabinets. as the light starts to turn }
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{stop it.}
<A>__{beck pauses the tape. we see nothing. doc is confused.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{back it up slowly.}
<A>__{beck does and we watch doc's face as he stares intently at the screen. suddenly he sees it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{on screen we see it. caught in the turn of the camera, now frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains of a man. only it is clear that this is no ordinary man. fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than normal. but it is the large head and long sharp teeth that especially catches our attention. mess same}
<B>__{on a beautiful bavarian setting}
<A>__{as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is actually one of dejesus' jigsaw puzzles. he takes a piece of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and places it perfectly into position on the puzzle. jones watches him amazed.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{you know that innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man? think about that. sixty four square miles.}
<A>__{he picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits it into place as jones watches. it's blowing jones' mind.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{how'd you do that?}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{what? that?...i've done this one before. you hungry? i'm hungry.}
<A>__{he gets up to go into the mess and jones looks at him in amazement.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{hungry? after what we just went through i may never eat again.}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{she jogs down the corridors toward the swamp. the shack creaks and willie looks down through the grating passing below her feet. it is dark down there. her feet pound off the metal grating. low angle we watch willie from below as she jogs past. then we tilt down to the dark, still water of the bilge. suddenly something stirs in the water a ripple like a trout in a stream. control room same using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions of the skull on the videotape, doc enters these measurements as they are read off to him by beck. as each of the measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:}
<B>__{danakil man.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{they found this?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no. i think they isolated him in genetic engineering. homo aquaticus...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{was there such a thing?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{danakil man?...one of our ancestors. named for the danakil alps in ethiopia.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{not exactly a big ocean country.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. most homo sapiens didn't make it...danakil man... adapted .}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{running. she jogs past the machine room. looking in, the machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the shack. there is something else though. we feel something in there watching her.}
<B>__{control room}
<A>__{on doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{but what about those scales... or that leech like thing that bit cobb?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why stop with just one aspect of marine life? why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(pointing to screen)}
<D>__{well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that russian ship? why isn't he out swimming around?}
<A>__{doc looks up at the image on the screen. the huge skull stares back hauntingly.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he obviously lacked something in his environment.}
<A>__{dormitory same on cobb he sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage. he turns on an overhead reading light and looks again. suddenly a voice startles him.}
<C>__{jones' voice}
<D>__{turned black yet?}
<A>__{at first startled, cobb recovers and answers sharply.}
<C>__{cobs}
<D>__{that ain't funny.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{relax, cobb. if it was going to turn, it would have done its trick by now.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's easy for you to say. you ain't the one that got bit.}
<A>__{jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on cobb's bunk. he picks it up and we see a photo of cobb's family.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{don't tell me you're getting soft on us, cobbie? you're the fellow who always said }
<A>__{cobb snatches the photo back from jones and glares at him with the same old, hard "cobb look."}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{nothing's changed, goddamnit!}
<A>__{jones leaves, and cobb waits till he is gone then looks back at his photo. his look changes, softening. absently he scratches his bandage.}
<B>__{swamp}
<A>__{willie enters and checks her running time on her watch. she bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.}
<B>__{overhead shot}
<A>__{we are watching her from above. for a moment she is quiet as if listening for a noise somewhere in the swamp. she looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the workbench. mess same dejesus looking for food. in the gloom of fluorescent lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a snack. he notices that the floor's wet near the sink. he frowns and hears a small noise, like something shifting slightly. he moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles, pails, rags...all he can see are shadows. he looks more closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when suddenly something touches his shoulder from behind! dejesus jumps, bumping his head on the sink as he whirls to see. jones, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{man, everybody is jumpy... what are you doing?}
<A>__{not fully recovered from the start, dejesus rubs his bruised head.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{getting some food.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{under there?}
<A>__{dejesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the sink.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{look. water.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{probably the plumbing. you gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?}
<A>__{dejesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at jones.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{no, i will be right there.}
<A>__{he looks down at his sandwich as jones starts out of the galley. something is missing.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{mustard. need mustard...}
<A>__{he opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
<D>__{sixpack...}
<A>__{he throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside. suddenly, like a snake, a two foot chunk of muscle attaches to dejesus's wrist! with his free hand dejesus tries to rip the twisting, writhing thing off. pulling at it he reveals part of sixpack's face one eye and part of his mouth underneath the surface. dejesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and causing an avalanche of pots and pans.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<B>__{inside the mess}
<A>__{jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when he hears the clatter of pots and pans.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{hey, hazy...what're you doing now...cooking?}
<A>__{there is no answer and jones looks up.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{hazy?...}
<A>__{he goes to the door and looks in. his eyes widen at the sight of dejesus staggering toward him with the squeezing hunk of muscle.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{help me, jonesy. oh, god, help me! it's getting inside me, i can feel it!}

<C>__{jones}
<D>__{hazy, please...i'm going to get you some help, man...just don't touch me...}
<A>__{jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to the galley. he closes it, rushing through into the mess to the ring corridor where he runs into cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{it's hazy...it's got him! stay here and don't let him out. i'm going to get the doc.}
<A>__{jones runs out and leaves cobb by the door. cobb watches him go. as the noise in the mess intensifies, we hear banging on the door, then dejesus' anguished cries.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{help me! help me!}
<A>__{cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm. upper ring corridor same jones meets beck and doc leaving the control room.}

<D>__{it's got hazy!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what has?}
<C>__{jones}
