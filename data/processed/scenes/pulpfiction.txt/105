<L>__{interior jimmie's bathroom day}
<A>__{jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while vincent stands behind him.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this jimmie's situation. he's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{if he kicks us out, whadda we do?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. but i never want it to reach that pitch. jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.}
<A>__{jules rises and dries his hands. vincent takes his place at the sink.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{just tell 'im not to be abusive. he kinda freaked out back there when he saw marvin.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{put yourself in his position. it's eight o'clock in the morning. he just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. don't forget who's doin' who a favor.}
<A>__{vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{if the price of that favor is i gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.}
<A>__{when vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what the fuck did you just do to his towel?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i was just dryin' my hands.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you're supposed to wash 'em first.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you watched me wash 'em.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i watched you get 'em wet.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i washed 'em. blood's real hard to get off. maybe if he had some lava, i coulda done a better job.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i used the same soap you did and when i dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' maxie pad. look, fuck it, alright. who cares? but it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. if he were to come in here and see that towel like that... i'm tellin' you vincent, you best be cool. 'cause if i gotta get in to it with jimmie on account of you... look, i ain't threatenin' you, i respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. he's your friend, you handle him.}
