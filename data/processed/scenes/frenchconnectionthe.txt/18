<A>__{a long view of the table with doyle and russo very close foreground, left and right. doyle is leaning on an elbow.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{who is that guy?}
<C>__{russo}
<D>__{policy man in queens.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what about the last of the big time spenders. you make him?}
<A>__{russo's eyes come off the show. it is a direct line from doyle's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of sal boca, the apparent host of the table of eight men and women, the men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars of blue or white lace trimmed shirts, the women in a mixture of pant suits and catskills cocktail party dresses, their hair coiffed towers.}
<C>__{russo}
<D>__{no, you?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{hunh uh. check the bread. he spreads it like the russians are in jersey.}
<C>__{russo}
<D>__{he probably sells insurance. owns a chicken farm in hackensack.}
<A>__{zoom in slowly on sal as he deals tips and orders. through doyle's eyes, we go from guest to guest at sal's table, taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and laugh, lost in the show chatter.}
