<A>__{gary and jimbo sit in their vehicle, watching as ted gets out of his car and is swallowed in a white out. he reappears a moment later farther up the hill.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{we should have checked the funeral announcements right away.}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{shoot.}
<L>__{exterior graveyard}
<A>__{a wind gust rocks the casket just as it's lowered into the frozen earth. the funeral breaks up quickly as paul and his wife shake hands with the minister.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that was lovely, thank you so much.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{margaret, paul, you two get some sleep.}
<A>__{paul looks nervously at margaret, who is about to reply. as her mouth engages, a gust of wind obliterates most of her words, except for...}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{...nun banger.}
<A>__{the minister smiles, he must have misunderstood.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{paul turns to see ted approaching. a blast of snow obscures his view. when ted reappears, he's just a few steps away.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{mr. barnell. there was no hurry on this, we could wait until }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's ok. we just wrapped up. this is my wife, margaret.}
<A>__{as they shake hands, and margaret opens her mouth to speak...}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{why don't you wait in the car, sweetheart?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{okee dokee, smokee.}
<A>__{margaret smiles and totters off.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's under a little strain right now.}
<A>__{ted looks down the hill at a small group of tv news vans, the reporters just now venturing out into the cold.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i see the media's here. they don't give people a moment's peace, do they?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i called them.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, they've been asking me to talk some more about raymond. i thought now might be an appropriate time.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and you'll just happen to mention your heartless insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy yet.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i had to borrow money for the casket, mr. ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you are breaking my heart.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, i doubt that. they asked me to bring some photos of raymond. guess it's gonna be a pretty big story.}
<A>__{he pulls out some shots of his brother. they whip around in the wind and blowing snow.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{of course, we could walk over there together. you could tell them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy and how... the check is on its way?}
<A>__{ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with paul's ploy.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{enjoy your press conference, mr. barnell.}
<A>__{paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill. ted watches him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes. looking down he sees a photo of raymond barnell, on the beach in swim trunks. must have fallen. ted pockets it and moves on.}
