<L>__{interior suite night}
<A>__{helen comes in hesitantly. the lights are off. the suite is large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the city. it is the room harry was using, posing as renquist. a french accented voice comes from the next room.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{she goes into the bedroom. there is a dark figure sitting in a chair, just a silhouette.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{step into the light.}
<A>__{it is a corner room. the drapes on one side are closed, shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in a slash of moonlight. she steps forward into it. tight close up on the figure. we can just make out that it is harry, though helen cannot. tilt down to show his hand, out of sight behind the chair arm, as he manipulates the pause button on the dat tape deck.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm michelle. carla's sick. she thought you might like me, so }
<A>__{harry goes sssshhhh. silencing her gently. he silently clicks off the pause button. the dat recorder plays. charles boyer, deep and hypnotic, speaks from harry's outline. harry lipsynchs.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{let me do the talking. you are very pretty. you may start by unzipping your dress.}
<A>__{pause button. she starts to yank the zipper down.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{no no. do it slowly. very slowly.}
<A>__{helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down languorously, revealing her creamy back. she is not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now slip the dress down... slowly.}
<A>__{helen is starting to get into the ritual. she lets the dress slip off her shoulders. it slides down her body to the floor. she steps out of it, still in high heels.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now slide the nylons off one by one.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{i'm not wearing any.}
<A>__{harry winces. he starts the next line immediately.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{that's good. now the panties.}
<A>__{the ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be tastefully done). she conceals the bugging device in her hand as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone. helen is still concentrating on her mission.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now turn, cheri, in the moonlight. let your body flow like water.}
<A>__{she turns. her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now dance for me. go on.}
<A>__{helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well. the scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic combination.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{let your hands be a lover's hands on your own skin as you move. yes, that's it.}
<A>__{tight on harry's eyes as he studies her. his game, meant to give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on mightily. he is amazed to see her playing the role, getting into it. this is not the helen is thought he knew for sixteen years.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now, lie on the bed and close your eyes.}
<A>__{she does. harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{keep them closed. do not open them.}
<A>__{he sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her. he strokes her hair, lovingly. then runs his fingertips over her eyes, down her cheeks. to her it feels delicate and delicious. part of her is enjoying this a lot. but helen is torn between wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i thought you only liked to watch.}
<A>__{harry goes ssshhh. it's all he can do. he bends over her and brings his lips slowly down to her. he touches them to hers so slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her. then he takes her in a passionate kiss. and she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and smashes it over his head. harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and semiconscious. helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to dress rapidly. she still doesn't recognize harry, who is face down. he groans and starts to rise. she kicks him in the ribs and finishes putting her dress on. she sticks the bug under the night table and grabs her shoes. mission accomplished, motherfuckers. harry grabs her ankle. she raises one shoe to kosh him again, and sees who it is. freezeframe. total shock. she can't even form the question.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{harry ?!}
