<L>__{exterior school docks sam & jimmy later}
<A>__{hosing down boats, stowing sails. they look up as... a huge power boat glides past. the docks rock in its wake.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{all right. i could party on that.}
<A>__{sam just laughs at him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's about all it's good for.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's the one to have.}
<A>__{he points to a beautiful triple masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the windward passage. i crewed on that one summer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{long time ago.}
<A>__{he pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you know, i want to thank you for getting me into this class... no way was my old man going to spring for the fees...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, you're working for it.}
<P>__{(beneath a laugh)}
<D>__{least you're supposed to be.}
<A>__{he tosses jimmy the coiled line. jimmy's caught off guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with sam.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{can i play too? or is it just for boys?}
<A>__{sam and jimmy turn to find kelly van ryan at the far end of the dock. she's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to reveal a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to reveal the swelling of her breasts. she favors sam with a coy smile.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{so who's washing your car this weekend, mr. lombardo?}
<P>__{(off sam's blank look)}
<D>__{the senior car wash, remember?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tamara's making a schedule. she said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list.}
<A>__{sam smiles, remembering.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, you know. figured i'd buy a washing ticket, support the effort. that old jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think?}
<A>__{sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, jimmy at his side. kelly falls in with then.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{not at all. how about if nicole and i do it? we're working as a team.}
<A>__{sam just looks at her. she looks back big, pleading eyes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay, try me on sunday. i'm going out to the everglades on saturday. you guys can wash the mud off.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{deal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, i just looked out front. my ride wasn't there. you suppose you could give me one?}
<A>__{sam doesn't answer right away. he looks toward the school.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{you wouldn't want me to walk, would you? i mean like, something bad might happen.}
<A>__{sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to jimmy, who seems to regard kelly with something akin to physical pain.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what about you, jimbo, you need a ride?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(still looking at kelly)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a ride. you want one?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah. but i got my bike.}
