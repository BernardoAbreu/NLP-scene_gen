<L>__{interior. third street night club}
<A>__{we look down on the whole night club, showing the dark, dingy, crowded, smallness of it. there is a strip going on. it doesn't look very interesting. our four men are huddled over a very small table in one of those third street clip joints. it is a dark little hovel, but a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely illuminating our four celebrators. behind them, a strip tease is in progress. every now and then, an almost stout woman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed in a white satin ill fitting gown, moves in and out of our view. half the tables and wall booths are occupied. there is a horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club. a three piece band is playing spiritlessly. walter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his own. charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake. arnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward eddie, who alone of the four men is giving any attention to the show.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{so what do you think of my girl, eddie? you met her. be honest with me. tell me the truth. i had the feeling you didn't like her.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{come on, come on, arnold. what do you want from me.}
<A>__{arnold turns to charlie.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{listen, charlie, i'd like to ask you a little advice. i mean, you're a married man. this girl, i'm supposed to marry, she's all right, but i'm not really attracted to her, you know what i mean? that's important, isn't it? i kissed her a couple of times, but i ... i don't know why i'm getting married, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what did you say, arnold?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i said, i don't know why i'm getting married. i did pretty good for thirty two years without getting married. i get along fine at home. my mother's a good cook. i have a nice life. what do i want to break it all up for?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, arnold, everybody feels that way before they get married.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{yeah? did i ever show you a picture of my girl?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, you didn't, arnold.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{do you want to see a picture?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{arnold clumsily hauls out his wallet and extracts a picture. he gives it to charlie who twists at an angle in order to get some light on it.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i want you to give me your honest impression, charlie. she isn't much, is she?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i can't see much in this light, but she looks like a nice pretty girl.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't say that. we were matched up, you know. the families kind of agreed on it. i was brought over to her by my mother and father. that's how i met her. she's some kind of tenth cousin. she's all right. she's quiet. i kissed her a couple of times. she just sat there and i kissed her. i think she expected more. she even asked me that. she said to me: "are you afraid of me?" i really don't go out with women much. you know. don't tell nobody this, charlie, but you aren't going to believe this, but i never ... i mean, you wouldn't believe that a guy of my age, i never ... don't tell anybody i ever told you this, but i never i mean, charlie, she's a widow. she's been married already she's going to expect a lot and i never what do you think i ought to do?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean, arnold?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i mean, you think i ought to marry her?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, arnold, even if i knew the girl, i wouldn't answer that question. i may not like her, but she may be fine for you.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{because i'm thinking of calling the whole thing off.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's kind of late for that, isn't it?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i'm scared stiff, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what are you scared about?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i'm not much of a talker, and she's one of those quiet ones. what are you supposed to do with your wife? i mean, most of the time.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(has to think)}
<D>__{most of the time, arnold, you don't even see her. you're away working. you come home, she fixes you supper. then one of you washes the dishes. then if you're not tired, you can go to the movies or visit somebody. or you watch teevee.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i do that now with my mother.}
<A>__{this gives charlie pause.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(scowling)}
<D>__{i don't know what there is to marriage. i suppose it's to have kids.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{so what do you think i ought to do? you think i ought to go through with this marriage?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{arnold, i can't answer that!}
<A>__{he stands abruptly.}
