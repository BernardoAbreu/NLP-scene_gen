<L>__{interior yamamura villa dining room night}
<A>__{the table is laid out with an elaborate looking dinner. asakawa sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened. she is whimpering softly to herself. just then, the door slides open and ryuji walks in. he sits at the table and picks up a pair of chopsticks.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{arent you gonna eat?}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{umm...}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{hm?}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{youll stay with me wont you? when its time for me to die.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{oh, stop it.}
<A>__{asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs ryuji fiercely by the arm.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{youll stay, wont you? if you stayed, maybe youd learn something that could help yoichi }
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{i said stop it! have you forgotten there was a girl with tomoko when she died? that girls now in a mental institution. who knows what could happen.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{but you could stay with me, ryuji. youd be ok.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{why, because im already not right in the head?}
<A>__{asakawa releases her hold on ryujis arm, lowers her head. ryuji slams his chopsticks down angrily.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{if thats the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father and son? yoichi was a mistake, anyway.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{short silence. when ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, reassuring.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{we still have two days left...}
<A>__{just then the voice of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from the other side of the sliding door.}
<C>__{kazue }
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{kazue slides the door open. she stands hesitantly in the doorway, something tucked under one arm.}
<C>__{kazue}
<D>__{its about miss shizuko.}
<A>__{ryuji shoots a glance at asakawa and stands up from the table, walks towards the innkeeper.}
<C>__{kazue}
<D>__{this is all that there is...}
<A>__{kazue produces an old black and white photograph. the photo shows a woman, seated, dressed in a kimono. a man in a western style suit stands beside her.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{is this professor ikuma?}
<A>__{hearing this asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for herself.}
<C>__{kazue}
<D>__{...yes. this picture is from before id entered the household.}
<A>__{she pauses a moment.}
<C>__{kazue }
<D>__{i should go now.}
<A>__{the innkeeper scuttles off, leaving asakawa and ryuji alone with the photograph. unbidden, the voice from the video enters their thoughts.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...}
