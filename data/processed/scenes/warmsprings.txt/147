<L>__{exterior meriwether inn morning}
<A>__{franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided by roy. eleanor is seated next to him; louis and elliot in back. franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees straight ahead. it is the entire warm springs group coming down the driveway in chairs and on crutches. all the patients, the push boys, the physical therapists, helena, jake, fred, aunt sally, eloise and lionel.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{don't worry, doc we're not coming with you.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{oh, you'll be with me. no question of that.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community.}
<P>__{(his voice growing stronger)}
<D>__{a community based not on birthright or privilege, but on compassion and courage. the true power of these waters is that they brought us all together. our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure. our ability to survive... despite the odds.}
<A>__{franklin looks out at the sea of faces.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together like a family and do what we do best...}
<P>__{(his voice breaking)}
<D>__{lift each other up.}
<A>__{franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse. then, spying helena, franklin calls out to her.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{miss mahoney i need to speak with you, please.}
<C>__{helena}

<A>__{off her smile, franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws a small box.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he hands it to helena. she just stares at it, at a loss for words.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{she does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{don't wear it in the pool.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i will try not to. good luck, franklin.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i'm throwing myself to the wolves.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{you've faced worse. and if they bite, you can come back here.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i will always come back here.}
<A>__{helena steps away and franklin pulls out and down the driveway.}
