<A>__{zzzzp! the electrical charge zaps through the device, electrodes sizzle, sending blinding sparks through the cradle. holmes and irene rip the cylinder out of the way just as... the sparks collide in a blinding flash and...}
<L>__{exterior big ben day}
<A>__{bong! the clock strikes twelve.}
<L>__{interior parliament}
<A>__{the men wait for something mythic, magical. and... nothing happens. nothing at all. they look around. everyone is still standing. coward looks confused, scared. other temple members eye him. blackwood hits the remote again. but again, nothing happens. we see something new in his eyes: fear. he ducks away fast, disappearing into the gallery.}
<L>__{117d interior sewer junction day}
<A>__{holmes and irene look each other in the eye. for the first time, neither knows what to say.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{that was something new for us.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes... it was.}
<A>__{she looks past holmes.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{watson }
<A>__{holmes whips around sees watson, seemingly dead. he goes to him, drops to his knees next to watson, feels for a pulse. with his face still pressed to the stones:}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure i heard the last chime.}
<A>__{holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, we made it. just.}
<A>__{watson rolls over, sits up. he's done, had enough.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{which part? the stench of the sewers or the broken bones?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my ankle's done.}
<A>__{watson looks around.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{where's irene?}
<A>__{holmes turns, looks. the cylinders are gone, and so is irene. his face darkens. he misread her yet again.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, i'm sorry...}
<A>__{holmes sees irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels. he motions to the disabled device.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{make sure lestrade keeps it intact.}
<A>__{watson nods. he watches holmes sprint into the darkness, face grim.}
