<A>__{max and mace support a semi conscious lenny, hustling him to the car. as they are putting him in the car, two lapd officers come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding lenny.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{everything's cool. too much to drink.}
<A>__{lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half out of the car. the squid tape of the jeriko kill falls out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement. mace's eyes go wide. the boot of one of the cops is inches from it.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah, uh... he slipped on the stairs. we're taking him to emergency.}
<P>__{(to the nearest cop)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{the cop steps back, giving mace room to push lenny back up in the seat. she surreptitiously kicks the tape under the car, over to the driver's side.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{go to cedars. it's closest.}
<A>__{mace nods and goes around the car. max starts asking them questions and the cops turn away, distracted. she picks up the tape and gets in. closes the door. let's out a big breath.}
