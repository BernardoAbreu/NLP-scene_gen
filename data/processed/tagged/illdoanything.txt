<L>__{interior passageway night}
<A>__{the camera briskly retreats as forty, highly charged, attractive, young people march towards it. each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone having the "high" of their lives.}
<L>__{interior new york club night}
<A>__{as the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor); the camera begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: 'this is 1975 and matt hobbs is singled out for the first time.' and now the camera reveals matt hobbs. his open, friendly, american face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession. the face at 26, and forever more, not arresting enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a "character." matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people. he dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as the dancers begin to sing "wow", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the sound of people shhhing; the singers falter and then stop as the party goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted tv set.}

<D>__{i'm not faulting you. you love your daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through. you feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that there's so much important stuff going down that there's no sure way of dealing with it, but the best thing you can do is just make sure you love her.}

<D>__{this is awkward, my driving you around and testing for you tomorrow.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, i hope you understand i can't drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test. it's just...}
<A>__{burke reluctantly considers, then:}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay. i was going to come in late anyway. i will get one of the kids to drive me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{thanks. and, look, if i get the lead in this movie, you'll have to go back to sitting up front with me.}

<D>__{jeannie's fine. there's a whole bunch of kids in the building. she's fascinated. and they're all ready for you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how many men are they testing today?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you're the only one.}
<A>__{matt is surprised... but he is a pro and so immediately makes use of this sudden blip in status.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then tell them i need a little more time. make up person no, it's okay, we're done.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i mean for me. i want to focus a little.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(she hugs matt)}
<D>__{good luck, matt.}
<P>__{(whispered advice)}
<D>__{the thing they're looking for most is sexy.}
<A>__{and then they're gone. with that bit of advice, matt is totally fucked up. a beat after cathy leaves:}

<D>__{you know who she was involved with for a minute or so? make up person who?}

<P>__{(quickly)}

<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{you guys have to leave. this is important and i need to be alone right now...}

<A>__{as crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but this time they are reading children of varied ages, and the kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc. jeannie is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy, as she makes her way through this world of the young, clinging to cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of "make believe" the stage parents taking one verse. at one point, cathy's begins talking to someone, blocking jeannie's view.}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{anyway, the girl i did it with, by the way, she's really good; the director, the crew... they all thought we nailed it.}

<P>__{(to cathy)}
<D>__{now?}

<D>__{some lady asked me to go in a room and, you know, make believe and say stuff like we were playing a game...}
<A>__{the words coming so fast that jeannie lets loose with a bolt of song, as if taking a moment to catch her breath. just a few sung lines proclaiming happiness.}
<C>__{jeannie}

<A>__{and the sung phrase.}

<L>__{exterior popcorn pictures day}
<A>__{as matt and cathy come into frame... matt forcefully placing her with her back to the wall. she is not one to be pushed around.}

<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(continuing right along)}
<D>__{...that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i didn't... she went for water and by the time she got back, they had offered her the part. blame burke, he was there...}
<A>__{matt takes this in. just a millimeter underneath his fury is professional curiosity.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what's the part, anyway?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{the white kid in a multi racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages. it's not a bad show. i sure can't wait to see the test.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how were they able to test her so fast?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{no. they offered it to her off the reading. i meant your test.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh... a child actor. just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out a series of her own...}
<A>__{cathy has nothing to offer. matt begins leading her back. we hold on their backs and see the chink in matt's confidence, hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:}
<C>__{matt}

<D>__{i'm doing it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not if i don't let you. that's the law, the police law.}
<A>__{she takes this shot hard, but tries to pretend otherwise, continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{do i have to learn to read to be on television?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(with a real edge)}
<D>__{you're going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer i have to wait the angrier i'm going to be.}

<D>__{i'm so mad.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{me too. just listen.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i don't... why?!?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{because i know about this. i have worked with kid actors... they don't have that much fun. they're inside all day... they don't get to go to regular schools or play with their regular friends like ricky and essa.}
<P>__{(progressively losing it)}
<D>__{and their parents? you think i'm going to be one of those parents, sitting in one of those rooms, where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids' sweat, all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone else's little girl?}
<P>__{(jeannie is totally confused, until)}
<D>__{no!! no way! i can't!}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okay. so, no, you're cuckoo anyway. i won't do it. and i don't care because i'm be stupid at it anyway.}
<A>__{she throws the script down. tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{pick it up, jeannie.}
<A>__{she's so down, she complies picking it up and walking it to the trash can. matt stops her and takes the script.}

<A>__{the staff of popcorn pictures is gathered in the boss' office watching matt's screentest on projection tv. burke sits next to nan on a sofa cathy sits in front of him others in chairs or on the floor. one assistant is attempting to "fine tune" the color the tint bar graph is on screen sliding between + and as the color changes. burke talks sotto to nan.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so how do you think 'ground zero' will do tonight?}
<A>__{she ignores him, continuing to watch the screen. he leans into her.}

<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(testy)}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what's wrong?}

<D>__{don't worry about my crying. as a matter of fact, crying turns me on.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, in that case, your dog died.}
<A>__{there is laughter in the room. the actress smiles through her tears pats matt for being wonderful.}
<C>__{actress}
<D>__{what happened at the meeting?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i can't remember. you're too pretty.}
<P>__{(on her look)}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i know.}

<D>__{you wouldn't want to fuck him?}
<C>__{female d person}
<D>__{well, six years ago, maybe.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think he's talented and attractive.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so you'd want to fuck him?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{he might be light in that area.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{the man is talented. if you get one of those directors who like actors, i think...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{a director can't make you hot if you're not hot. you'll end up with warm which is death.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(defending matt slightly)}
<D>__{we laughed.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{let me ask you something... would you fuck him?}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{everything doesn't boil down to...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{let me stop you before you embarrass yourself.}
<A>__{burke rises and addresses his staff... the camera has his back in the foreground as it moves towards a rendezvous, burke moving too as he continues...}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{we all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to. everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say... i'd fuck her... i wouldn't fuck him... and you're ducking it... i want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue.}
<A>__{and now burke and camera meet up the effect being that he is talking directly to us as he continues.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{we do have some kind of responsibility to the audience... you just saw his screentest... so, if this is the first time you saw the guy, do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends, 'i'd sure go to bed with him; oh god, would he be something.' would you, cathy?... i'm being real here.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay, so let's keep looking.}
<A>__{they file out. cathy gets up several beats later than the others... and follows them out, avoiding nan's look.}

<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{matt... matt... maybe it would be easier if i just said 'hi' to her... hi, jeannie... yes, it's exciting... no, no. he's right, honey, they get somebody to read it to you. now, put your dad on it's important. no, first put your dad on... damn it!}
<P>__{(she waits a beat)}
<D>__{...matt. uh huh, a few hours ago... they all... everyone liked your work, but i think they'll go for a name or something.}
<A>__{she listens to him. he is hurt. cathy, though, is also wrestling with her own internal struggles. she has betrayed him and is ashamed; in a strange way terrified. she is, therefore, just a little irritable.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{it's not a matter of doing it differently... they liked what you did, a lot... they laughed and... it's not you... it's them.}
<P>__{(suddenly her breath comes weird)}
<D>__{no, please. don't thank me. if you feel like getting together later or anytime, call me, okay? you sound like you have your hands full right now... goodbye.}

<D>__{i wanted to talk to her again... i...}
<A>__{she stops in mid sentence, looking at her father. he is overcome... his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life. she moves to his side. he starts to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards the bathroom, rubbing jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance. he closes the door.}
<B>__{on jeannie}
<A>__{devoid of anger. sympathy so pure that it wrenches. she starts to move towards the bathroom. her voice sweet...}

<D>__{everything's okay... i'm sorry i forgot to put you back on with cathy.}
<A>__{he walks across the room, jeannie tracking him.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{you didn't cried because of that... i don't even want to talk to her.}
<A>__{matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable to keep up appearances other than a few minor half hearted tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his side. she pets him some... this goes on for several beats as the strains of "you could be wonderful" accompany the moment. then:}
