<A>__{hearing dorothea's cry, harry looks back towards the passageway. butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at harry a second time. but swann catches hold of his arm.}
<C>__{swann}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{whatever he's doing to her, stop him!}
<A>__{and harry's up and away }
<L>__{interior nix's house passageway night}
<A>__{ he dashes over the glass }

<A>__{on nix, dorothea clasped close to him. he revolves as he floats over the chasm below then.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(to unseen cultists)}
<D>__{you see, i escaped the grave. so i have to give something to the grave in return.}
<A>__{on the cultists, listening to their lord with love in their eyes. a slit opens in the middle of nix's forehead, above the bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in the library), and from it comes a wave of darkness. as nix revolves, the darkness strikes the ground around the cultists. at first they don't realize what's going on. they think this is some kind of bizarre blessing. then the ground starts to liquify beneath them.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i have to give something back. so i'm giving you.}
<A>__{they're starting to scream now as they sink into the ground. they struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry for them. they are dragged down, thrashing as they sink.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{why? why?}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{you're not worthy. none of you. only swann was worthy. you just waited like lambs.}
<A>__{harry appears in the doorway. nix, still swinging round, has his back to harry.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{well i'm not your shepherd.}
<A>__{harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him. the ground is now re solidifying around the cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt. the scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror. screaming faces locked in the solid ground. twitching hands the same. harry starts towards nix and dorothea, gun levelled. so far, he has avoided nix's gaze.}
