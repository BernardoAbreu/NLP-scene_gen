<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior rocket hangar}
<A>__{ted, in flight coveralls, follows after simon who is overseeing the operation.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you're seeing bugs where they don't exist, striker.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(holding wire)}
<D>__{look at this wiring. it's shorting out under high temperatures.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you're tired, striker, overworked. that wiring meets all the safety specifications.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i know you've been subtly spreading the word that i'm having a breakdown.}
<A>__{a newspaper boy passes.}
<C>__{newsie}
<D>__{shuttle test pilot goes mad!}
<A>__{a technician jacobs enters with drawings of flight outfits.}
<C>__{jacobs}
<D>__{sir, these are the designs for the flight uniforms. i think the captain's is to die.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(with drawings)}
<D>__{good, good, no, no, good. what's this?! i said no studded dog collars, jacobs.}
<A>__{jacobs grabs the drawings and leaves in a huff.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you won't get away with this, simon!}
<A>__{ted turns to leave and bumps right into elaine. she holds him.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ted, what's wrong?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(pulling away from her)}
<D>__{ask simon.}
<A>__{in b.g. a car is parked by a huge rocket engine. a worker opens the hood and strings jumper cables to the rocket. a sign above rocket reads, "rocket engine test area."}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ted, you're overworked. you've been flying yourself into the ground.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong with me!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{let's relax tonight, just the two of us. i will make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're as bad as the rest of them, elaine!}
<P>__{(ranting)}
<D>__{it's all here in the design specifications!}
<P>__{(grabs plans from a passing technician)}
<D>__{look! it's all here!}
<A>__{simon signals the guards. they grab ted. he struggles and rants. a doctor in white approaches and injects something into ted's arm.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no! wait! you're hurting him!}
<A>__{ted falls unconscious. simon holds elaine.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{elaine! ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the middle east.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(crying on simon's shoulder)}
<D>__{simon, why has he become so... so...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{so mentally ill?}
<A>__{elaine collapses on simon's shoulder, sobbing. simon smiles evilly. the technician with the jumper cables, b.g., signals the driver to start the car. the car revs and the rocket fires.}
