<L>__{interior mission control night}
<A>__{low hum of conversation, a bunch of the workstations are vacant, techs sleeping in cots nearby. borokovski, in his best suit, 20 years old, comes in led by two nasa flunkies. unhooks his filtration mask. vindicated.}
<C>__{borokovski}
<D>__{all right, i am borokovski. i am here.}
<L>__{exterior hab (mars) pre dawn}
<A>__{sky's beginning to grow light. last of the fire flickering out. nothing left of the hab but a few metal ribs. gallagher stirs. stiff from sleeping on the ground. burchenal and pettengill follow. they've lived through the night. gallagher walks off twenty paces. when we see him again, he's unlocked the top and bottom of his suit and dropped the trousers to his knees.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i'm the first man to piss on mars.}
<A>__{burchenal and pettengill follow suit on the other side of the hab. a beat, then }
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{damn.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{whoa.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{you sure get some arc in this low gravity.}
<A>__{the sun's gonna break any minute. something suddenly hits burchenal. he yanks up his pants, runs to remains of the hab. looks around desperately. pulls free a metal rib. turns to gallagher.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{run. towards the sun.}
<A>__{robby understands or doesn't bother to ask why. takes off. burchenal yanks free a shard of metal. pounds it into the sand a dozen feet from the hab. the sun is just breaking the horizon. robby is fifty yards away.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{stop! left. left. a little more. right. mark it.}
<A>__{he adjusts his own peg a tad. robby comes loping back.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{what'd we do?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{(approvingly)}
<D>__{built a directional. now at least we know where something is.}
<A>__{the radio crackles.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{good morning, boys. martian weather today's clear and cold. warming to a high today of around sixty.}
