<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{you know, we actually tried free will before. after taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the roman empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own. you gave us the dark ages for five centuries until finally we: decided we should come back in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again. so we gave you the renaissance, the enlightenment, the scientific revoluton.:ï¿½we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason, then in 1910 we stepped back again. within fifty years you brought us world war i, the depression, fascism, the holocaust and capped it off by bringing the entire planet to the brink of destruction in the cuban missile crisis. a decision was taken at that point that we should stop in again before you did something even we couldn't fix.}

<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{we put elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to, give that speech the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, made you the front runner for this coming election. the intervention on charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub prime crisis, bringing two major banks down. with it, and in, the process making you unelectable.}
