<L>__{interior truman's mother's apartment, queens. day.}
<A>__{truman stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy. doilyed apartment with his older sister, raquel, late forties, prematurely grey. through a doorway, the figure of his mother is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour. truman and raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{don't you dare go in. truman. i just got her off to sleep.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{it was dad. i swear.}
<A>__{raquel fixes truman with a contemptuous stare.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{well, the next time he shows up. bring him over. until then, i'm not saying a word about this to mom and neither are you.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{if it wasn't him, it was his twin. can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?}
<C>__{racquel}
<D>__{i know a reason he'd want to hide from you. look at how you treat us. you live ten minutes away, we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you don't even believe it yourself. haven't you hurt her enough, truman? she already blames you.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{i was seven years old!}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{but you're here and he's not. has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i'm telling you he's alive!}
<C>__{raquel}
<P>__{(snapping back bitterly)}
<D>__{and i'm telling you he's fish food!}
<A>__{truman meets her unforgiving eyes. without another word, he walks out of the apartment. truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out. christof, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close to truman without being detected. raquel's demeanor immediately changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears younger, posture more upright, almost a different person. christof hugs raquel.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{you did well.}
