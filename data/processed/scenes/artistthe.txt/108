<L>__{interior kinograph studios peppy set 1931 day}
<D>__{a screenplay lies on a table. peppy and zimmer are seated either side of the table and are talking animatedly. we're on the set we saw the previous day, and peppy seems to be trying to convince zimmer of something. she seems to be describing a film poster or the facade of a movie theater she'd love to see. he doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to peppy. she finally stops talking and gives him a determined look. zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies. title card: george is a silent movie actor. he belongs to the past. today he's a nobody. as zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat. zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking. title card: what are you doing? she looks him straight in the eyes, and answers: title card: i'm stopping work. it's him or me. she looks determined. he's looking unsure of himself. he visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. she drives her point home. title card: what i mean is it's either him and me! or neither of us! zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. he just looks at her. title card: i'm blackmailing you, get it?! even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and zimmer looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's obvious that he's going to back down. the people around them are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting for his decision. there's an element of deja vu to the situation, and zimmer, who already backed down a few years before, gives in. title card: and why not... she smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and leaves. as he moves away she whistles at him. he turns round and she vigorously blows him a kiss.}
