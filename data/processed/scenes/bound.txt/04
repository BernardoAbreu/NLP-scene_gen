<T>__{dissolving into:}
<L>__{interior bathroom morning}
<A>__{the whining motor of a high powered drain rod. the spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere. the machine is so loud corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door. killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door. behind the door is violet, wearing jeans, a white t shirt and cowboy boots.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{hi. my name is violet. we sort of met in the elevator }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{yeah, sure. i'm corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i heard you working in here and i just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?}
<A>__{she is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sure. come on in. give me a minute.}
<A>__{violet steps inside as corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what happened to rajeev?}
<A>__{corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.}
<A>__{she wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{so this is temporary for you?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{pretty much. one day at a time.}
<A>__{violet hands her the cup of black coffee.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i guessed you were straight black.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{good guess.}
<A>__{they both sip from the piping hot mugs.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{mmmm ... thanks, i needed this.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my pleasure ... but to be honest, i did have a slightly ulterior motive here. i was wondering if i could ask a small favor?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{a favor?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah, see, i'm kind of a night person, so i was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, it isn't your fault. the walls here are just so thin.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{are they really?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes, it really causes problems. sometimes it's like you're in the same room. but if it's too much trouble, i understand ...}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no, no trouble. there's other work to do.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you're doing everything yourself?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that is so amazing. i'm in awe of people who can fix things. my dad was like that. we never had anything new. whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. his hands were magic.}
<A>__{she looks at corky's hands cupped around the mug.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah ... i bet your car is twenty years old.}
<A>__{corky smiles.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{truck.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{truck. of course.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{'63 chevy.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<B>__{violet sips}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{so, how do you know the owner, mr. bianchinni?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't, really. i was referred to him.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh, really.}
<A>__{corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{do you know him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, but caesar does. he likes him. says he's a good italian.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{caesar is your husband?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh no, no. i'm not the marrying kind.}
<A>__{smiling, she says nothing else.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i should be going. you can drop the cup off anytime.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{corky watches her leave.}
