<D>__{maybe later. ray, let me say this up front i'm not a cop.}
<A>__{dunbar turns away, no longer interested. hardy continues:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i used to be, but that's beside the pointerior who i am doesn't really matter; what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble. you understand that, right?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{now, i don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly i don't really care. i'm just doing a favor for colonel styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. to be honest with you, though, i don't care about that either.}
<A>__{dunbar looks up at this, surprised.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i don't know those guys, you do. they die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news tragic, but it doesn't affect me. the only thing i care about is i agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up. you like baseball?}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i asked for a policeman.}

<A>__{he dunbar nods.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i was also his " knife dummy" .}
<P>__{(to osborne)}
<D>__{see, west used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. he'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. that was a loooong day.}
<A>__{hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to dunbar.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{incidentally, ray, i promised them i'd ask where west and the others are. can we get to them?}

<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. making it through was kind of an honor. some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight, command would consider you at the top of the class.}

<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{and nunez idolized mueller. big fella from new mexico. after he got sectioned he just followed mueller around like a lap dog. he wasn't mean like mueller, though, didn't have it in him.}
<A>__{next to nunez is childs, small and weasely with feral eyes.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{but childs did. didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near.}
<A>__{behind childs runs pike.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{pike i told you about. he took the brunt of it from mueller and west. once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. dunbar (v.o.) (cont'd) he'd been busted for auto theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the army. he made the wrong choice.}
<A>__{next to pike, dunbar and kendall run side by side. kendall is short like childs, but also weak. wheezing.}

<D>__{finally kendall and me. kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. pike and i tried to help him, but...}

<D>__{no, actually, i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{my brand. must be my lucky day.}
<A>__{he takes one and lights it. dunbar does the same.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{let me ask you one thing. you seem like a good guy, ray. you carried kendall wounded to the pickup. so what i don't get is what you did to make nunez want to kill you?}

<D>__{senator daddy must be thrilled.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{he is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and i have done my best to oblige him. however, in the last four weeks, i began a relationship with another cadet. what do you think of that?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i think you just blew "don't ask, don't tell" out of the fucking water.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{he admitted it.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{right in front of us. mueller went after him but we held him back. pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up. so we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm.}

<A>__{kendall turns to her and smiles.}
<C>__{kendall}

<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you hated west as much as i did. i'm not saying what i did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead.}
<A>__{kendall says nothing. pike looks around, makes sure no one is listening and then whispers:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{the thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. you turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked }
<C>__{kenoall}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{a gay senator's son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise? the press'll crucify you and your father. his career will be over and it'll be your fault. but we do this different and you come out a hero.}

<C>__{kenoall}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{mueller. he's as bad as west and we both know it. now i can't do it, cause i'm tied up, but we get the others to go along }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{don't think i want to hear this }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. maybe nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeant's killers!}
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{we'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west, all we gotta do is tell the story right.}
<A>__{kendall stares at him. disgusted.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you're sick, pike.}

<A>__{kendall, coming through the door as we slo mo... mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead... nunez, wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane... and a badly wounded childs, pistol out, turning towards the sound of the door and firing... kendall's arm, hit with a slug, and he starts to go down... freeze frame on kendall's form, falling.}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{i don't think he meant to do it. it was just reflex he'd already been gutshot. i must have passed out cause next thing i knew...}
<L>__{exterior louisiana bayou dawn}
<A>__{the sounds of running and heavy breathing. kendall's eyes flutter open. he's on dunbar's back, being carried through the woods. the sound of gunfire and a tree branch shatters next to them. someone is chasing them. trying to kill them. nunez. dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes from behind and we can now hear rotor blades approaching...}
<L>__{exterior clearing dawn}
<A>__{as dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying kendall. the entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but from kendall's viewpoint the helicopter overhead, nunez behind, dunbar turning and shooting, nunez going down...}

<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{and that's it.}
<A>__{hardy is silent. staring at him.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{nunez was chasing dunbar.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because he'd shot mueller.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{but you didn't see it, right?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{like i said, i was in the kitchen. when i came out, mueller and pike were dead, nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why did he come back for you?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i honestly don't know. maybe to have someone to cover for him. and i wish i could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.}
<A>__{silence. kendall's got nothing more to say.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{okay. i think that's it. he rises and walks to the door.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{mr. hardy?}
<A>__{hardy turns back.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{what did dunbar tell you?}

<C>__{hardy}

<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it's too neat.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{"too neat." how long have you been an investigator?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i don't think that has anything to do with }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that means under a year. let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic. there are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. dunbar's our guy.}
<A>__{osborne struggles to put it into words.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i just... he came back for kendall. i don't think he's capable of murder.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{everyone's capable of murder, osborne.}
<A>__{osborne turns, making her case to styles.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{look, all we've got is what kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except nunez. he found west, he saw mueller and pike, but just their bodies he didn't see any crime committed.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well, i'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{west's body isn't in the creek bed.}
<A>__{they stop arguing, turning to look at him.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{we've already been over the terrain twice. nothing.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{without the body we have no physical proof. we need a confession.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{from dunbar? i hate to break this to you, but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{nevertheless }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{not for me.}

<D>__{well, why didn't you say so? we'll just drop all your charges, then }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i'm serious }
<A>__{hardy leans across the table.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{fuck "you're serious", raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{did kendall tell you about the px?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{he said he worked there }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no, did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?}

<D>__{what business?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{pills, shots, you name it, basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{so childs made some side money, so what? people are dead, ray, and the only one we have to blame is you }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{didn't shoot west }

<C>__{hardy}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{am i scratching your surface yet?}
<A>__{dunbar stares at him for a moment and then launches himself at hardy, screaming. tackles him to the floor, choking him... osborne, pulling her sidearm, and pistol whipping dunbar in the head! dunbar goes sprawling off hardy as m.p.'s rush into the room, restraining him. hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm talking about west! we had him, bill, we were there. you're the fucking base commander, you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? he deserved it. there's your confession.}

<D>__{west was a monster! fifteen years ago, i was here, i was section eight, i was pike. fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did, stripping pike down, making him stand outside all night? he did that every year, he did that to me. fifteen years ago, i wanted him dead, and now i'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? sorry, no can do. i tried.}
<C>__{osborne}

<A>__{hardy stares at her.}
<C>__{hardy}

<D>__{you saw west, right? how was he killed?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{full clip to the body }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{from up close or far away?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{his chest was hamburger }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{that's close range. you go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. look at my uniform. nothing.}
<A>__{dunbar looks. not a speck of blood on it.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{and where's mueller's? when i came in, he was only wearing a t shirt.}

<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m.p.'s }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{we wait and i'm a dead man. i got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much i hated west my court martial will take six minutes. it's either me or them, ray, and you gotta decide right now.}

<C>__{pike}
<D>__{where's your shirt, mueller?}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{used it to start the fire }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours?}

<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{so you took off your shirt?}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{to start a fire, goddammit!}
<P>__{(pointing to pike)}
<D>__{what about him, huh? maybe he offed the sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. y'ever think of that? go ahead, cut him loose! first chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work }

<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{the fuck are you talking about }
<C>__{pike}

<C>__{pike}
<D>__{until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{mueller pulls his sidearm and points it at pike.}
<C>__{kendall}

<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{don't do this }

<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{put it down!}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{tell him to shut up }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{ failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself }

<C>__{pike}
<D>__{although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{shut the fuck up you fucking nigger }
<A>__{pike leans forward.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you stupid white trash motherfucker, i saw you do it }
<A>__{and mueller fires. pike's head snaps back. the gunshot, deafening. then, for an eternity, silence. nobody moves. nobody breathes. as if time has stopped.}

<D>__{oh.. . my god...}

<D>__{he wouldn't... stop talking...}
<A>__{he takes a step forward towards pike. a hole in the middle of the black man's forehead.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{so you killed him?}
<C>__{mueller}
<C>__{i. . .}
<A>__{almost mechanically, dunbar begins to reach for his own gun... the unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being racked simultaneously. dunbar turns to see childs and nunez, their m 16's in hand. levelled at him.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{get that hand away.}
<A>__{dunbar does. looks to nunez.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you too?}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{we can still come out of this okay. pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. that's the story.}

<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{west was one thing, but this }
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{shut up, mueller.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you framed him...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{none of that matters now. we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. you're either with us, or against us which is it?}
<A>__{dunbar and kendall, looking at each other. it's clear what the wrong answer will mean. a long beat, until}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{okay }
<A>__{he is cut off as the wind outside roars the hurricane mounting to it's full force and the windows blow inwards, showering childs, mueller, and nunez with glass! dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, pulling it... mueller, screaming, trying to claw the glass from his eyes... childs, seeing dunbar move, pulls the trigger. .. . and the cabin is filled with the thunder of gunfire as kendall goes down, clutching his arm... dunbar fires, hitting childs directly in the chest... childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets punching into mueller who jerks like a marionette... nunez, drawing a bead on dunbar, about to shoot, when... a great crescendo of wood splintering and supports buckling overtakes them and the cabin's roof comes down on their heads.}

<D>__{yeah... yeah, sure.}
<A>__{she goes over to the machine and pours a cup.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you shot childs and nunez.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you saved kendall's life }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{but not pike's.}
<A>__{osborne hands him the coffee.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{would you have believed me?}
<A>__{their faces say "no". osborne spreads a map out on the table.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{where's the cabin?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{don't know on a map. west told us it was there, we just found it. maybe the hurricane took it away.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. otherwise this is just another story }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{mr. hardy, i joined the army for college money. i didn't ask for any of this i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. you say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. i don't want to die.}

<A>__{hardy and osborne, walking and talking.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{talk it through: childs, mueller, and nunez know they're going out on the regular tuesday night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it: kill west, pin it on pike.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and they're smart about it. they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{dunbar.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. you only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{so it's a good plan but it goes wrong; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{buttfucks the cabin?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and all hell breaks loose. a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{so why, after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house, does the senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?}

<D>__{he tried to burn dunbar to us. you don't do that if you're not involved.}

<D>__{you both know if you do this, if you go after a senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{we know.}
<C>__{styles}
<P>__{(to hardy)}

<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you don't get to be a colonel without compromising. without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs. you politic, play it safe, think of the career first. and when things get dirty, you just look the other way...}

<D>__{not much time to solve the crime. tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres? did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten.}
<C>__{hardy}
<P>__{(to osborne)}
<D>__{can i go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?}
<A>__{kendall begins coughing.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i think they're giving me the wrong medicine. this isn't a very good hospital, you know }
<A>__{hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{epileptic attacks are murder on your system. rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.}
<C>__{hardy}

<A>__{he returns with a glass of water and hands it to kendall.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{pike never confessed.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{no, but it got you interested, didn't it? got you to dig. inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{is it the truth?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{there's that word again.}

<D>__{then he's mistaken. you know, i really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why did you tell us he shot everybody, levi? you put him in for three murders, the man saved your life }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off, i ran in, childs shot me, pike and mueller were dead, and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar was running out the door? ohhhhhh... see that's where i was confused, because i thought you said nunez was running out the door.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{no. i said dunbar.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{huh. you know, i really thought you said nunez. i thought you said "dunbar was gone," my fault, i gotta check the tape on that.}
<P>__{(off kendall's look)}
<D>__{oh, yeah we taped the last interview. this one too. cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.}
<A>__{silence. they wait for kendall's reaction. he looks momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i believe your next line is "what are you trying to hide?"}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{sorry to disappointerior i'm on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind. you're right, it was nunez. any more questions?}
<A>__{hardy doesn't know what to say. that was his ace card.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{don't get me wrong, mueller and childs were quite the pair, the type of guys you didn't feel comfortable going to sleep around. completely capable of murder. but as i said, i didn't hear the exchange before the shooting. i wasn't in the room.}
<A>__{osborne furrows her brow at this as hardy continues.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar will testify that you were.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{then we'll leave it up to the courts his word against mine. what does his father do again? steelworker?}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{doesn't matter, i'm sure justice will be served. in any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. he's quite protective.}
<A>__{osborne turns to hardy.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i need to talk to you outside.}
<L>__{exterior base hospital corridor day}
<A>__{osborne and hardy, exiting the room. whispering:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{we're fucked, i know }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{they got their stories straight.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what kendall said "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." that's what dunbar said about childs to the letter.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{positive. hardy, they planned this.}
<A>__{she grins. he grins back.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{not bad for hostile and uncooperative, eh?}
<L>__{interior kendall's hospital room day}
<A>__{hardy and osborne reenter, smiling. kendall chuckles.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{something funny, levi?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.}
<A>__{hardy pulls the out microrecorder and hands it to osborne.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why don't you talk to levi off the record for a second?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{good idea.}
<A>__{smiling, she stops the tape. then turns to kendall.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you and dunbar got your stories straight. little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you. you think you're just going to slide out of this? you're an accessory to murder, levi, you're going to jail }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you can't threaten me }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{didn't do anything }
<A>__{osborne laughs.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, levi. we're going to find those bodies and when we do, i'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that's a fantastic idea }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{see, i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission }
<C>__{kendall}
<P>__{(beginning to panic)}
<D>__{it won't work }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{it will and you know why?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the united states army; you have no identity, no miranda warning, and no rights. so i'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you i'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!}
<A>__{she finishes, breathing hard. kendall, totally cowed. hardy, trying to suppress a smile. osborne rises for the door.}

<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{dunbar's telling the truth.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{wrong answer }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{we did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was because i threatened him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because of what i saw.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who really killed west.}

<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{who killed sergeant west?}

<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{childs.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because i was standing next to him.}
<A>__{he pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i was in on the px thing. he and mueller and me, we were making thousands. west found out. childs said we were just gonna scare him use my dad's clout. i had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. we met him in the creek bed but before i said anything...}

<A>__{dunbar pulls kendall from the cabin's wreckage. as kendall begins to talk to him, dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{i told him what had really happened to west. told him to keep quiet about it or i'd destroy him. because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam, my father would be finished.}

<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{so you framed him. the same way childs was going to frame pike.}
<A>__{kendall nods. crying a little.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{little advice, levi, next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves.}
<A>__{kendall says nothing.}

<D>__{maybe }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{maybe what }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{maybe he }
<A>__{and then. his mouth slams shut. teeth cracking together over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body jerks horribly, going horizontal, shaking violently! osborne, leaping to her feet.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{get something between his teeth!}
<A>__{hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove it into kendall's chattering mouth. his teeth, clamping down on the metal and hardy's hand, drawing blood.}

<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{what is }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{he's an epileptic!}
<A>__{the nurse runs to the bed, pushing hardy aside. as more medical personnel runs into the room, they usher hardy and osborne to the door.}

<L>__{interior base hospital waiting room day}

<D>__{you couldn't have known }

<D>__{yeah, i could've. should've.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you wanted to get the truth.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no, i didn't. i wanted to humiliate him. for what he did to dunbar. for fucking over the little guy.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you mean the falsely accused?}
<A>__{hardy looks up at her and nods.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you wanted to break him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{she looks back to the floor. hardy takes a drag from the cigarette, and then tosses that away too. the door opens and styles walks into the room. somber.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{it's over. time of death was 4:42.}
<C>__{styles }
<D>__{jag's been notified and i called the senator myself. my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that's horseshit and you know it.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{maybe. but it's my fault and i will carry it.}
<A>__{he sighs and takes a seat next to them.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{we found the cabin. demolished, like they said. no bodies. hurricane like that coulda scooped 'em up, dropped them down two counties over. we'll find them.}
<A>__{hardy says nothing.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you think you could explain all this to me?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i wouldn't know where to start.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i guess it was about one man framing another. he thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.}
<A>__{styles nods, understanding.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what happens to dunbar now?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. you'll understand if i don't walk you out.}
<A>__{hardy gets up to go and then stops. realizing something.}

<D>__{they're taking your command, aren't they?}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{now i go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{nah.}
<A>__{they pass a group of cadets doing drills. hardy, watching them. almost looking wistful.}

<D>__{you know, you never told me why you left the army.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all i did here was follow orders. it didn't add up.}
<P>__{hardy [cont'd)}
<D>__{plus, i got kicked out.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that's gonna stay my secret.}
<L>__{interior motor pool evening}
<A>__{hardy and osborne make their way towards hardy's car.}

<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{no.}

<D>__{good, just making sure.}

<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{but that wasn't enough. you needed a new identity, because no one was going to believe james randall pike, convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger you needed a name people could trust, one that hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't publicly been west's bitch boy.}

<L>__{interior coffee room present evening}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{can't do that now, though, can you?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable discharge a guy who did "everything he could" to save his friends.}
<A>__{dunbar looks at them. one to the other. slowly.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{is that what i did, now? and of course, you can prove all of it.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{we can prove that you're not ray dunbar. impersonating a fellow cadet is a court martial in and of itself }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{did i ever claim i was raymond dunbar? was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? no. you assumed who i was, because i was wearing this uniform. don't believe me?}

<D>__{ohhhh, i don't think so...}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{just a guess. maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. maybe somebody moved them. habeas corpus no bodies, no crime, and nunez still plays as self defense. face it detectives ... you have nothing.}
<A>__{hardy, knowing he's right. in a flash he reaches down pulls osborne's gun and grabs dunbar, slamming him up against the wall, pressing the weapon to his temple!}
<C>__{hardy}

<D>__{we need to talk }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{he takes a slug of his drink.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven guys. what was it you said? you were "just starting to believe i wasn't the guy people said".}
<A>__{he chuckles.}
<P>__{hardy {cont'd)}
<D>__{seven. that's the answer to kendall's question. how many? seven.}
<A>__{osborne looks at him. realizing what he's saying.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{this isn't the time }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{this is the perfect time. you know what makes a good detective? the number of confessions they get. you're a good detective, osborne. so now you get mine.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what if i don't want it?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{tough.}
<A>__{he pours himself another drink.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{thing about taking money is, you don't have to do anything. you just sit there. maybe you don't return a phone call. maybe you don't follow up a lead. but that's it. keep the money, your work's done.}
<A>__{osborne stares at him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven unsolved murders. and you know what? it didn't weigh on my conscience. not one goddamn bit.}
<A>__{he takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{there are degrees of truth, officer. always degrees.}

<D>__{you're a good man, hardy.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{far as i'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.}

<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me.}
<A>__{he motions to the bartender for another glass, but osborne takes his hand, stopping him.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{and because you're a good man, i know you'll do the right thing.}
<A>__{hardy looks at her, questioning. osborne takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{pike never made it to d.c.. somebody took him off the plane before it left. my guess is he's already dead.}
<A>__{hardy stares at her.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{west?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{nobody saw. but i don't think so.}
<A>__{she puts the papers on the bar.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{these are the requisitions from the px, the ones used to release the drugs to mueller. west signed half of them pike was telling the truth. look who signed the other half.}
<A>__{she taps the bottom of the paper. hardy, not wanting to believe it. he looks up at her, pained.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{do i have a choice in this?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{yeah. i can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.}

<A>__{styles squints at the figure.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{tom, is that you?}
<A>__{hardy steps forward, into the office.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{it was so good, i actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. the base commander. the one in control.}
<A>__{you couldn't let him testify, could you?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{if you let him testify then it would have all come out. west was supposed to take care of it out there, shut nunez up and then disappear. but it got messy and people got killed. so you called your old pal tom hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you're drunk }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm not going to cover for you, bill. not for this.}

<C>__{styles}
<D>__{or what? you've gone round the bend }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{west had a partner. someone who knew how to get things done.}
<A>__{hardy throws the papers onto styles' desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what i can't understand is why you signed these. if you'd just let west take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{that's preposterous }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{toxicology report came back. kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. it's for asthmatics. if an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. i checked with the nurses at the hospital you're the only other person who visited kendall.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{wanted to see if he was okay }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you poisoned him, bill. you heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like pike.}

<D>__{i'm not even going to dignify that }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no! you will stand there and you will listen! what happened to you, bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world. you were the one who believed in it }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? the army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? there's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{he walks towards the desk.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no more witnesses. west's a ghost. but it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and kendall's toxicology report. and that'll be enough.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you're crazy }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you can't duck this, bill. i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{for the last time, i have no idea what you're talking about }
<C>__{hardy}
<P>__{(squinting)}
<D>__{get your hands away from the desk!}
<A>__{in the darkness we see styles move suddenly...}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{osborne, gun!}
<A>__{hardy dives to the floor osborne in the doorway, pistol raised, fires two shots! muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as styles is blown back against the wall! hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the light. styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. dead. osborne lowers her weapon, shaking. hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. inside it sits an ivory handled pistol. fully loaded, safety off. it's presence tells them everything they need to know.}
