<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{... captain, we know something's going on up there major }
<A>__{the major looks at some papers in front of him.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{communications naturally dwindled with the lack of v.c. activity, this is routine, expected ... but six months ago communication virtually stopped.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{about the same time large numbers of montagnards of the m'nong descent began leaving the area this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the rhade tribe that lived in the area for centuries. but what is unusual is that we began to find rhade refugees too in the same sampans as the m'nongs. these people aren't afraid of v.c. they've put up with war for twenty years but something is driving them out.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{we communicate with the base infrequently. what they call for are air strikes, immediate always at night. and we don't know what or who the air strikes are called on.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{who ?}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{you see, no one has really gone into this area and come back alive.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{why me ?}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{walter kurtz, lieutenant colonel, special forces. we understand you knew him.}
<A>__{he puts kurtz' dossier in willard's hand.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{he's commanding the detachment at nu mung ba.}
<A>__{the colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder, flicks it on. the recording is first static the air controller then asks for more information on target coordinates it all sounds very routine, military. then a frantic voice comes on, talking slurred, like someone dumb, except very fast.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{up 2 0 give it to me quick mark flare affirmative damn immediate receive hearing automatic weapons fire man ...}
<A>__{gunfire is heard and a lower, slower voice in background.}
<C>__{second voice}
<D>__{blue delta five this big rhine three need that ordinance immediately goddamn give it to me immediate christ big rhino blue god delta damn goddamn.}
<A>__{a heavy burst of automatic weapons fire insane laughter static, and faintly, very faintly we hear hard rock music more static suddenly a low, clear voice peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.}
<C>__{third voice}
<D>__{this is big rhino six blue delta.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{that's colonel kurtz.}
<C>__{kurtz }
<D>__{i want that napalm dropped in the trees spread it among the branches. we'll give you a flare an orange one bright orange.}
<P>__{(static)}
<D>__{we'd also like some white phosporous, blue delta. white phosporous, give it to me.}
<A>__{static interrupts the major turns the machine off.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i only met kurtz once.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{would he remember you ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{what was your impression of him ?}
<A>__{willard shrugs.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{you didn't like him.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{anyone got a cigarette.}
<A>__{the major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i thought he was a lame.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{a lame ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{this is years ago, before he joined special forces, i guess. we had an argument.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{about what ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i don't know. he was a lame, that's all.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{but why ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{he couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{well, he's killing now.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{what does that mean ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{maybe it's not kurtz. i don't believe he's capable of that. i just don't believe it.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{it's got to be kurtz.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{the point is that kurtz or somebody attacked a south vietnamese ranger platoon three days ago. last week a recon helicopter was lost in the area another took heavy damage direct fire from their base camp.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{our recon flight ?}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{ours.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{touchy.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{you can see, of course, the implications, if any of this even rumours leaked out.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you want me to clean it up simple and quiet.}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{exactly you'll go up the nung river in a navy p.b.r. appear at nu mung ba as if by accident, re establish your acquintance with colonel kurtz, find out what's happened and why. then terminate his command.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{terminate ?}
<C>__{civilian}
<D>__{terminate with extreme prejudice.}
