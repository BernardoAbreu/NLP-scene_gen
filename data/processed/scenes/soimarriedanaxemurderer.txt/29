<L>__{interior harriet's apartment night}
<A>__{the lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian apartment. there is artists paraphernalia strewn around. a small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. she smiles and walks off into the kitchen.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i will make us some tea.}
<A>__{he checks out her apartment. on the wall there is a huge poster of the boardwalk in atlantic city.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, you know what this apartment needs? a really large oversized poster of atlantic city.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i used to live there. that's where i had my first supermarket job.}
<A>__{on his way out, he peeks into the bedroom, where he finds a bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with the wall. it is just kind of "there".}
<C>__{harriet }
<P>__{(coming into room)}
<D>__{i only have chamomile. i hope that's all right.}
<A>__{he looks at her and then at the "oddly placed" bed.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it's north south.}
<P>__{(to his confused look)}
<D>__{for health reasons. see... i had this friend, he was a martial arts expert. anyways, he used to sleep north south. i don't know... it's a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(walking into living room)}
<D>__{you know scotland has it's own martial arts. it's called fucku. it's mostly head butting and kicking people when they're on the ground.}
<A>__{harriet starts laughing. then so does charlie. they lean into each other. pretty close. too close even, and when it seems like they're going to kiss, charlie suddenly gets uncomfortable and looks at his watch.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{late?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no. no. not for me.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{who for then?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who for then what?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{well, you looked at your watch and said it wasn't late for you... i wondered who it was late for.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not me. no, sir. not here.}
<P>__{(after a pause; checking watch)}
<D>__{maybe it is late.}
<A>__{she gets him his coat. he starts to leave.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look, the truth is, yes, i had a great time, and i'd like to kiss you, but if we do kiss, then we'll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch, then we'll kiss in the bedroom, and once you're in the bedroom well, the thing is, i always rush it. and this time i feel like maybe i should wait. maybe we should let it build naturally and grow, instead of just immediately spending the night together.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i want to spend the night together.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(sold)}
<D>__{i have no problem with that.}
<A>__{the bedroom middle of the night they are both fast asleep. she is curled up in his arms. suddenly, she begins to speak.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{yes! yes!}
<A>__{charlie's eyes open. he smiles.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{yes ralph. i will. ralph.}
<A>__{charlie's smile fades. he sits up and looks at her. she is lying completely still on the bed, her eyes closed, and still sleep talking.}
<C>__{harriet }
<D>__{now now ralph!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(waking her)}
<D>__{harriet...? harriet...?}
<P>__{(as her eyes open)}
<D>__{you were having a dream, or...? you kept saying the name ralph.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{ralph?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ralph. i heard you say it.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{that's odd. just today i was thinking about, her. she's a friend.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(starting to leave)}
<D>__{is she nice ? ralph...}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{yeah. she's great.}
