<L>__{exterior campus entrance}
<A>__{grady, james leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with crabtree at the campus entrance as vernon and oola prepare to leave in the galaxie.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hey, vernon. can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{shoot.}
<A>__{grady glances at little round oola.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{boy or girl?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{as long as it looks like her, i don't care. you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{grady watches vernon give oola a kiss on the forehead.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right. well, thanks. for the lift.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{no sweat. only do me a favor?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{stop calling me vernon.}
<A>__{crabtree leans into grady, whispers.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{the jacket, tripp. we need the jacket.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{oh, right. oola. about that jacket...}
<C>__{oola}
<D>__{yea?}
<A>__{grady looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it used to belong to marilyn monroe. she had small shoulders, like you. most people don't know that.}
<A>__{as oola smiles, pleased, vernon shakes his head.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{man, that book of yours must've been one nutty motherfucking ride.}
<A>__{vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into grady, and pulls away. crabtree stands stunned.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you mind explaining what you just did?}
<A>__{grady watches the shrinking galaxie sail under a drooping nordfest banner, lost in thought.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{came to my senses. crabtree ah. well. congratulations. meanwhile, what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{walter gaskell isn't going to send james leer to jail, crabs. i know that.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{do you know he won't expel him?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no. but i don't think that matters.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{that's very enlightened, professor. it's comforting to know that america's children have you for a teacher.}
<A>__{grady blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the buildings of the campus, his voice still distant.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{nobody teaches a writer anything. you tell them what you know. you tell them to find their voice and stick with it, because that's all you have in the end. you tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't to keep at it, too. because that's the only way to get where you're going.}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{of course, it helps if you know where you want to go.}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{maybe that's the only thing that and sara that's made the last seven years worthwhile.}
<A>__{grady slides james' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it. }
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{as for james, he doesn't need me anymore...}
<A>__{without warning, grady tosses crabtree the knapsack.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{he's got you.}
<A>__{crabtree stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, watches grady walk away.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{me? what can i do?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{gee, i don't know, crabs...}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{improvise. you're good at that.}
<A>__{grady continues on, leaving crabtree to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i'm sorry, tripp.}
<A>__{grady stops, turns.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you peeked, didn't you?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i peeked.}
<A>__{grady considers this. nods. it doesn't seem to matter anymore}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{it really had the makings, tripp. there was a lot to admire. i've ...never read anything quite like it.}
<A>__{if there was a kentucky derby for editorial bullshit, crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, and show. and grady knows it.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you're not just trying to make me feel better?}
<A>__{crabtree looks directly at grady, his old friend.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{scout's honor.}
<A>__{crabtree and grady stare into each other's eyes. both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well, thanks for that, crabs.}
