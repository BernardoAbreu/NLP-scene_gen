<L>__{exterior highway godzilla same}
<A>__{like a dog with a bone, godzilla shakes his head trying to rip the rest of the highway free. the portion of highway in front of the cab tears free, lifting.}
<L>__{interior godzilla's mouth}
<A>__{from the cab we see the horizon lift as the road begins to give way. the sign above crumbling further. nick turns and sees... electric cables sparks sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign, nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. he takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens the cab door. grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he jams the cable down into godzilla's tongue. sparks fly! nick leans back inside, slamming the door shut.}
