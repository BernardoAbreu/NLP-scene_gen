<L>__{interior chuck e. cheese a little later day}
<A>__{an extreme cu of the chuck e. cheese manager. he wears braces and head gear, which causes him to lisp.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{welcome to chuck e. cheese!}
<A>__{wider reveals...chaos. screaming children everywhere. on stage, the chuck e. cheese automaton band jams.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i wish i were in chechnya.}
<T>__{a little later:}
<A>__{brownies are running around, playing video games and skee ball. shane's watching peter, in the plastic ball pool, while he holds tyler in the snuggle. the manager approaches shane.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{anything elsh i can do for you?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{in a big glass (he shows him) this much ice... this much cyanide.}
<A>__{the manager laughs, but the headgear seems to hurt his face when he smiles.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{how `bout a re fill on that pischer of mischer pibb?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(gesturing:)}
<D>__{pischer of mischer pibb? mischer pibb?}
<A>__{frustrated, the manager picks up a pitcher and exits. lulu approaches, she grabs shane by the sleeve and drags him over to the stand up mortal kombat game.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{let's fight!}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'm watching your brother...}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{i pressed two player. i thought you liked combat. unless you're scared.}
<A>__{shane doesn't like the sound of that. he steps up to the machine. he cracks his knuckles, stretches. then he takes a joy stick. he checks over his shoulder peter's happily splashing about in the plastic balls. on the screen: they each select a fighter. lulu picks a small female character. shane picks a man who looks like shane. they begin, lulu screams out with her fighter, in unison:}
<D>__{video game lulu prepare to be annihilated!}
<A>__{she leaps over shane in a somersault and throws a dozen throwing stars. then kicks him in the head repeatedly.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{that's not fair. nobody can jump thirty feet.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{the hulk can.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{that wasn't a documentary.}
<A>__{the second round starts, brownies have gathered around to watch. lulu's fighter does a series of kicks. shane can't even get one punch in she pins him to the ground, kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face. shane is taking it really seriously. he's really mad.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{this isn't fair. my joystick's broken.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{you wanna switch?}
<A>__{they switch sides. round three starts. lulu's fighter picks up shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her in half over his knee... and then a kick in the face.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(re: the snuggle)}
<D>__{you don't have a baby on your chest...}
<A>__{lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing... shane's really fuming.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{you're not even trying...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i am too trying.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{too slow... come on take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss...}
<A>__{she keeps dancing. it's really annoying. shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her. he is ko'd. she does a very obnoxious victory dance.}
<C>__{lulu }
<D>__{in your face! i am the greatest hand to hand combat champion in the entire world!}
<A>__{shane screams and rips the joystick off the machine. sparks fly. shane looks around to see if the staff noticed. he and the brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.}
