<A>__{; a110 exterior road day a police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the outskirts of los angeles. a ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a freeway in the distance. nothing stirs around the cruiser except some pump jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it. a111 in the cruiser. the t 1000 sits inside. john's notes and letters are spread out on the seat beside it. sarah's voice speaks from a cassette deck. john's tapes. her voices mixes with the static filled chatter of the radio that t 1000 monitors for any signs of its targets.}

<A>__{t 1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section. it then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier. ecu on envelope. we see the postmark: "charon mesa, calif." tight on t 1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope. it glances up at the sound of crunching gravel. in the rear view it sees a bike cop pulling onto the shoulder behind it. the big kawasaki 1100 idles up next to the t 1000, still seated in the cruiser.}
<C>__{bike cop}
<D>__{howdy. i saw you pulled over here earlier. everything okay? t 1000 everything's fine. thanks for checking.}

<D>__{since you're here, though, can i talk to you a second...}
