<L>__{interior nightstalkers headquarters armory day}
<A>__{blade, king, and abigail stand before a table where an assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on display. hedges is there too, assisting them. zoe watches.}
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{we've got a wide assortment of ass kickery for your viewing pleasure }
<P>__{(hefting a pistol)}
<D>__{electronic pistol. comes with a built in fingerprint security system. fires a three shot burst in 1 500th of a second. bullets can also be triggered remotely.}
<A>__{king tosses blade a bullet. he studies it it's more complex than a standard round.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{explosive rounds?}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{but with a concentrated burst of uv light instead of your standard hollow points. i call 'em sun dogs.}
<P>__{(to hedges)}
<D>__{hedges super size me, baby!}
<A>__{hedges tosses king one of the four barreled firearms. on the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud flap girl silhouette.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{this little mamacita a modified version of the army's objective individual combat weapon. pick your poison stakes, sun dogs, heat seeking mini rockets. whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out.}
<P>__{(gesturing to blade's sword, sarcastic)}
<D>__{of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but }
<A>__{next, hedges shows blade the crescent shaped device that abigail used. he gives the device a twist and }
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{we call this the uv arc }
<A>__{chinkt! the device extends from either end, telescoping outward. connecting the tips is a concentrated uv laser.}
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{you hold the arc in the center, curved away from you. connecting the tips is a powerful uv laser beam. because of its high focus, the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{we're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to dracula. turning into mist? kinda doubt it. but general shape shifting? maybe.}
<C>__{hedges}
<P>__{(off blade's look)}
<D>__{not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that. but another human, someone with the same approximate body mass given enough practice it might be possible.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{he wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure. probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array. commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues, resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will }
<C>__{king}
<P>__{(raising his hand)}
<D>__{question. have you ever been laid, hedges?}
