<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly, the "new york times" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. who cares what the new york times thinks?}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{your work's beautiful. that's a fact, moll. it doesn't matter what anyone thinks.}
<A>__{we can tell from the expression on molly's face that it does. sam puts his arm around her. she nestles close to him. then, suddenly, she stops and looks up. there is an unexpected seriousness in her voice.}
<C>__{molly}

<D>__{i want to marry you, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{what?}

<P>__{(staring at her)}
<D>__{it's just been so long since... i mean, you never wanted to talk about it.}

<C>__{molly}
<D>__{do you love me, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you think, moll?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{how come you never say it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you say "ditto". it's not the same.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{people say "i love you" all the time. it doesn't mean anything.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sometimes you need to hear it.}
<A>__{sam stops and stares at molly. he pauses quietly. he is about to speak when a man's face emerges from the shadows behind him. molly gasps. sam spins around.}
<B>__{an intense looking man}
<A>__{is standing in the darkness between two buildings. he stares at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk. sam and molly stand motionless. the man hesitates and then begins walking the other way. molly exhales a deep breath. sam takes molly's arm and they continue briskly down the street. suddenly they hear footsteps coming after them.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what should we do?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let me handle this.}

<C>__{willie}
<D>__{your wallet!}
<A>__{sam waits a beat.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{give it to him!}
<A>__{sam reaches for his jacket. the mugger grabs his wrist and then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{take the money. just leave the wallet and my...}
<A>__{he swipes sam across the head. molly screams. the mugger whacks her across the face. sam explodes, plowing into the mugger with all his might.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam, no!}
<A>__{there is a wild, all out brawl. sam fights like a mad man. suddenly the gun goes off. the mugger panics and takes off running. sam charges after him.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam!!!!!}
<A>__{the two men run down the dark street, but the mugger is already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows. sam gives up. slowly he turns and begins walking back toward molly. we can see molly dimly at the end of the block as sam approaches. she is screaming for help. frightened, sam calls out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly!}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. sam tenses and starts running toward her. he is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. an expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.}
