<A>__{sam, molly, and carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating from cartons of chinese food. frank, a gray cat, eats beside them. unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.}

<A>__{the cat begins nibbling sam's food.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{get outta here, frank!}
<P>__{(the cat scampers away)}
<D>__{you should have seen her. all pink and flushed. her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. and she's screaming, demanding to see the president. so wilton brought her to me.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you? you weren't even a vp yet.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she didn't know that.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's a montana accent?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the one you always slip into it when you get nervous. "yes, ma'am. thank you, ma'am. can i fondle your breasts, ma'am?"}
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{molly}
<D>__{admit it. you liked me. you were interested.}
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{molly}
<D>__{cute?}
<P>__{(looking at carl)}
<D>__{do you believe this? i should have been picasso's mistress. i should have been living in barcelona or paris. but no, i'm moving in with a new york banker who thinks i'm cute.}
