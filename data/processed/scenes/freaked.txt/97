<B>__{the door knob}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{rick! come on!}
<A>__{rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him. he sways, and knocks the pepsi cup of sludge rolling. he watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to a stop across the room. for a second, he contemplates making a dash.}
<C>__{outside}
<A>__{elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and finally has a good grip. he twists the knob...}
<C>__{inside}
<A>__{rick sees the door opening. he dives down into the hole. the floor board falls into place just as elijah walks in. elijah scans the room. he goes over towards the tasty freekz machine and finds the styrofoam cup.}

<D>__{bad for the environment.}
<A>__{he crumples it in his hand.}
