<A>__{richard sits back down.}
<C>__{ross }
<D>__{she says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office.}
<A>__{ross points to richard's chest where a red laser beam holds on his heart.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{bright red.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what does she think this is? amateur hour? tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a fifty seven millimeter ordinance.}
<A>__{all of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying a picture of richard standing with the president hanging on the wall just behind his head. the red dot is back on richard in a heartbeat.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{she says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. and you have ten seconds to give her the address.}
<A>__{richard starts to come unglued.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{how can i be sure once she has the address she won't kill me anyway?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you can't. but i can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. trust me on this one.}
<A>__{after an interminable moment...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{eight seven six magnolia terrace... new orleans.}
<A>__{there is a long pause on the other end of the phone.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{she asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(sweating)}
<D>__{with pleasure.}
<A>__{a moment later, the red dot disappears from richard's chest. richard breathes out. ross reaches out, shakes richard's limp hand.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{thank you. because honestly i didn't know how i was going to explain you splattered all over your walls.}
<A>__{ross exits. richard looks at the shattered picture. the president's head is intact. the bullet has ripped richard's face clean off. close on a big steel door opening revealing an armory of weapons from pistols to rpg's.}
