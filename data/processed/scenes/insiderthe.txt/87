<D>__{you heard mr. sandefur say before congress that he believed}
<A>__{nicotine was not addictive...?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{...i believe mr. sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully.}
<A>__{lowell's reaction. jeffrey's statements are stunning and powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{all of us did. there was this whole line of people...whole line of ceos up there all swearing.}

<D>__{part of the reason i'm here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within brown & williamson's representation, clearly misstated ...what is common language within the company...we are in the nicotine delivery business.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{and that's what cigarettes are for...?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{a delivery device for nicotine.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{a delivery device for nicotine. put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...}

<D>__{you're gonna get your fix...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{you're saying that brown & williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{the process is known as "impact boosting..." while not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. there's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.}
