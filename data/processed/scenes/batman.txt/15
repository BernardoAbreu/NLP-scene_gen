<L>__{interior penthouse day}
<A>__{a huge plate glass window opens on the best view in gotham. this spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power perks available to carl grissom, kingpin of the gotham city rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm. grissom, behind a big broad desk, addresses his lieutenants a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white collar types and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this makeshift 'boardroom.' the big boss waves a copy of the gotham globe with harvey dent's face on the cover.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{nine points ahead in the new poll. i don't like the way this is shaping up.}
<A>__{jack napier slouches in an easy chair off to grissom's right, doing his trademark one handed shuffle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we can always pop him. or pop someone close to him.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{let's feed him to the bat.}
<A>__{this suggestion draws chuckles from several members of the crowd. grissom is unamused.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{he's going after our front companies. specifically ace chemical. which would tie us in with councilman kane, senator miller... on up the line.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{how do we go? the usual fire?}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{i'm thinking break in. trash the office, remove the relevant documents...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{"industrial espionage."}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{that's right. and jack }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'd like you to handle this operation personally.}
<A>__{jack has just turned up the third ace off the top of the deck. his hand freezes in midair.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{... me?}
<A>__{at this exact moment, metal doors slide back and alicia hunt steps out of grissom's private penthouse elevator. she's carrying a handful of shopping bags.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{hello, sweetheart. i wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room.}
<A>__{alicia's gaze meets jack's as she vanishes through a side door. the eye contact is not lost on grissom.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why do you need me to handle a simple break in?}
<C>__{grissom}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{because i want someone i can trust.}
<A>__{jack bridles, but doesn't protest. nervously, he turns the fourth card off the top of the deck. it's not an ace. it's a joker a joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre hole through its face.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{we'll work out the details later. but it's got to be soon. all right, that's all for now.}
<A>__{grissom's cronies get up to go. jack, troubled, lingers behind a moment.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{you don't mind, do you jack? it's an important job. i can't trust it to somebody who'll screw up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{grissom}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{jack. don't forget your lucky deck.}
<A>__{jack pockets the deck and leaves. grissom sits behind the big desk and grins wolfishly.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{my friend, your luck is just about to change.}
<A>__{he reaches for the phone. alicia appears in the doorway nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. he smiles coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{get me lieutenant eckhardt.}
