<L>__{exterior country road day}
<A>__{nick is in the back seat, laughing. the sun is beginning its descent and the sky is taking on a reddish tinterior}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i can't believe you made it!}
<A>__{nick climbs into the front seat next to alex, and for a second, he's pretty close to her. he kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the moment. then he sinks back, catching his breath.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you got the schematics?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again. driving. wind whipping alex's hair around. she stares at the road ahead.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{so where do we play the game, nick?}
<A>__{nick doesn't answer at first. for a second there, he'd managed to forget everything.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i've been thinking about that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{arcade's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started. you know, like his point of origin?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{dante's inferno.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{the inferno.}
<A>__{overhead, as we watch alex's skylark speed away from us. shadows are creeping across the landscape now. streetlights are flickering, sputtering on. and night is falling.}
