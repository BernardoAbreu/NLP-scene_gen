<A>__{the trek from the beach to the village has started. a long line of people, including some local natives, carry the sick in crudely made litters. even this short trip is hard. somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the harmonium up the jungle path. just behind them hector is helping nuno to carry his mother in a litter. it is like a civilization on the move. in a day or two the wind and the sea will have rubbed out all evidence of their stay, and the bay will welcome its regular tenants, the turtles.}
