<L>__{exterior elena's house night}
<A>__{more sounds of merrymaking, coming from elena's house. salvatore listens to it, sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to celebrate, welcome in the new year. but further on, that window remains dark and shut. salvatore gazes at it again. there is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. maybe it's the specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, but something tells him that's going to be the right night. the night when she'll open her window. in fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. salvatore's eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. the window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. the music reaches its climax. two hands come out. salvatore shuts his eyes for a moment, to hold back the flood of feeling. he opens them again and sees......the hands reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. the light goes out. it is midnight. an echoing voice does the countdown.}
<C>__{radio voice}
<D>__{six, five, four, three, two, one, zero! happy new year! happy new year!}
<A>__{and a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. salvatore has remained standing there immobile, speechless. disappointed. defeated.}

<A>__{at his house, glasses are about to be raised. there is a strange, tense merriment. maria is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. she glances at the door, hoping to see salvatore appear.}

<C>__{exterior elena s house night}
<A>__{but salvatore is not happy in these first few minutes of the new year. he feels hurt, humiliated, rejected. he walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying down from the terraces. that was his last night. he's not showing up beneath that balcony any more.}
<C>__{projection booth. cinema paradiso interior afternoon}
<A>__{outside there is a violent thunderstorm. the pounding of the rain and the rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound track of the film being shown. two buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. salvatore is alone. for the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. he is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for elena. he tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces of his grief. he is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. and now stands there watching him in silence. the thunder is deafening. that someone is elena. she comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking about her. whispers.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{salvatore...}
<A>__{loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. salvatore turns and sees her as if in a dream. it is a sudden blow to the heart. the look on her face is wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and who now realizes at last that she is in love too. for salvatore it is an overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...a long passionate embrace that is never ending. they are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other again. they spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the first part endings and the trailers. another intense look, their eyes locked...and it is their first kiss. a kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. amidst the film strips dangling around and touching their young faces. meanwhile the film has finished, the projector turns uselessly...down below the screen is blank, the audience whistles...but salvatore hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless whirring of the reels in the projector. all he hears is her breathing, an he feels is the warmth of her skin. int exterior various settings day the happiest, most vivid moments salvatore and elena spend together: a country outing. they eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the prickly pear for plates. a chase through an endless field of wheat. in the projection booth. a cake with seventeen lighted candles. salvatore and elena blow them out together. and then a kiss.}
