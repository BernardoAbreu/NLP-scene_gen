<L>__{interior bellvue hospital day}
<A>__{jacob is in the "mental health clinic" at bellvue hospital walking through the psychiatric emergency room. it is overflowing with people. some are handcuffed to their chairs. policemen are with them. jacob approaches the main reception desk. he speaks nervously.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'd like to speak to dr. carlson, please.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{carlson? is he new here?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{new? he's been here for years.}
<A>__{she shrugs and looks at a log book.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{not according to my charts. do you have an appointment?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{look, i need to see him. i know where his room is. just give me a pass. i won't be long. ten minutes.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{our doctors are seen by appointment only.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{damn it. i was in the veteran's out patient program. he knows me.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(not happy)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jacob singer.}
<A>__{she walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times before coming back over to jacob.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{i'm sorry but there's no record of a jacob singer in our files.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{whataya mean, no record?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{you want me to spell it out? there's nothing here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. there's about an hour's wait. i will be glad to take your name. why don't you just fill out this form?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddamn it! i don't want a social worker. carlson knows me.}
<A>__{jacob pounds the desk, rattling a tiny african violet and knocking the receptionist's forms to the floor. she grunts angrily and stoops to retrieve them. standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off. two knuckle like horns protrude from her skull where the cap had been. jacob's eyes lock on them like radar. he backs away. she immediately replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with demonic intensity. jacob, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the "in patient" door.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{hey! you can't go in there!}
<A>__{jacob doesn't stop. a policeman, guarding the entrance, runs after him. jacob charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution. a line of mental patients, all holding hands, is moving down the hall. they break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. their attendant tries to calm them down but the sight of the policeman increases their hysteria. they grab hold of him as he tries to get by.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{let go! get away!}
