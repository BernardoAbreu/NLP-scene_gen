<L>__{interior colin's office day}
<A>__{colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while going over patient files.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{oh, hi. everything okay?}
<A>__{we intercut.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{couldn't be better. i just wanted to call and tell you how much i enjoyed meeting you.}
<A>__{mike picks up the extension and listens in. abby glares at him, but she can't stop him.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{oh, thanks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{so... i was just thinking that we should have dinner.}
<C>__{colin}
<P>__{(not great)}
<D>__{oh... great.}
<A>__{mike shakes his head, knowing where this is going.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{there's this new french bistro that got fantastic reviews and there's a gallery opening in old town on friday. so, if you want, we could have dinner, then go to the opening.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{hmmm, friday... wow.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{is that not a good time?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{actually, abby, i'm still kind of unsettled with the move and everything so i`m really not }
<A>__{mike snatches the phone from abby and hangs it up.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{saving you. he was blowing you off.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he was not.}
<A>__{she moves to pick up the phone. mike sits on the phone to stop her.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't! he'll be expecting you to call him back. when you don't, he'll call you.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{because i know men. if you want it to work out with this guy, you'll listen to me and do exactly as i say. you already did irreparable damage with your psycho aggressive control freak phone call. it might even be too late. even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than abby, his desperate neighbor.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm not desperate!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{why, did i sound desperate?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{listen to you desperately asking me if you sound desperate.}
<A>__{a concerned look from abby as...the phone rings. her caller i.d. says sacramento med.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{although you won't admit it, you know i know what i'm talking about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's your call, dude.}
<A>__{she thinks, looks at the phone again...}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{okay. what do i do?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{pick up the phone and say: "hey, doug."}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why would i }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{just do it.}
<A>__{she answers the phone.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{hey, doug.}
