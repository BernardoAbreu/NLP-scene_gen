<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{blackness and a loud thud. suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. another thud and more light. we see a hole. the hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. huge clouds of dust fly into the air. molly looks up, astonished.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and about eighty years of dust.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{we have all this height, sam. we could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. that would leave all this space.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(eyeing her curiously)}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{for space. just space.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{be great for bumper cars.}
<A>__{carl laughs as he looks at sam. their bodies, covered with white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam, this may be none of my business, but i'm concerned you're doing too much coke.}
<A>__{sam glances down at his white body. they all laugh.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey, sam, turn around.}
<A>__{sam obeys. molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket. her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(offering his body)}
<D>__{how 'bout me?}
<A>__{molly nods. she reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his. his stomach jumps sensually as she touches it. molly pulls back to admire her work. he looks like a greek statue.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i will never wash again.}
<A>__{molly laughs.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sam, molly, and carl are holding their sledgehammers. molly begins to count.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{all together now. one,}
<P>__{(they strike the wall}
<D>__{with their hammers.}
<P>__{the wall shakes)}
<D>__{two,}
<P>__{(they pound again.}
<D>__{the wall begins to}
<P>__{give)}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{in unison, they hit it once more. a massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground. new clouds of dust fill the air. suddenly, sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. something rattles inside it, a penny.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, look what i found. there's a penny inside.}
<P>__{(he hands it to molly)}
<D>__{for luck in our new loft. it's a good omen.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(shaking her head, disagreeing)}
<D>__{you're the good omen.}
<A>__{she glances at him lovingly. carl looks at the two of them and grins. as the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines of the space they are working in. it is a huge loft over four thousand square feet. banks of windows run east and west. molly steps back and admires the room.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's gorgeous.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you guys lucked out. hell, i bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sell it? carl, we just bought it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what i wouldn't do for a place like this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's gonna be great.}
