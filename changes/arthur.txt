<LOC>__{EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district. The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches. A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover. BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars. We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'. Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit. The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away. The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn. A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.}
