<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation great house day}
<A>__{ march, 1852 the slaves are now employed working on an extension to the great house. the slaves work under the direction of mr. samuel bass, a between forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and light hair. he is cool and self possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with extreme deliberation as well as a canadian accent.}
<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation great house day}
<A>__{as the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between epps and bass. bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone. though at first epps does little more than joke his way around the facts. solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as epps offers bass a drink, which bass waves away.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{take it. you look unsettled.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i'm well.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no shame in taking respite from the heat; drink, shade. it's ungodly for travelers. hearty, or otherwise}
<A>__{bass gives a laugh.}
<P>__{epps (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{i meant no joke.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{your humor is inadvertent.}
<A>__{sensing perhaps bass's laughter might be at his expense, epps presses.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{then share what's funny. or what ills you.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i'm here to complete the work at hand. as requested, and as paid.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{something rubs you wrongly. before i take further offense, i offer you the opportunity to speak on it.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{you ask plainly, i will tell you plainly. what i find amusing: you worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{"the condition of my..." what in the hell are you }
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{it is horrid. it's all wrong. all wrong, sir.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they ain't hired help. they're my slaves.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{you say that with pride.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i say it as fact.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{if the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery. i wouldn't own a slave if i was rich as croesus, which i am not, as is perfectly well understood. more particularly among my creditors. there's another humbug: the credit system. humbug, sir. no credit, no debt. credit leads a man into temptation. cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from}
<P>__{(more}
<C>__{bass }
<D>__{evil. but this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what right? i bought 'em. i paid for 'em.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{of course you did. the law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies. is everything right because the law allows it? suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ha!}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{suppose.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that ain't a supposable case.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{because the law states that your liberties are undeniable? because society deems it so? laws change. social systems crumble. universal truths are constant. it is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all. white and black alike.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa. yah compare me to a nigger, bass? yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. now, i seen one of them critters in orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger i got. yah'd call them fellers citizens, i s'pose?}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{look here; you can't laugh me down in that way. these niggers are human beings. if they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. there's an ill }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{a fearful ill, resting on this nation }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you betray yourself a foreigner!}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{that will not go unpunished forever. there will be a reckoning yet.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you like to hear yourself talk, bass, better than any man i know of. yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you. a fine supposition if yah lived among yankees in new england. but yah don't.}
<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{you most assuredly do not.}
