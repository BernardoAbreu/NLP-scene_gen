<A>__{rachel stands aside as the old man embraces samuel long and hard. she watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big family bible. he crosses to the table, sets the book down, places his hand on its pulls samuel to the table beside him. rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid book's gun, takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of the coffee jar. she drops several as she tries to figure out how to open the chamber to load it. in the b.g., eli glances up, sees what she is about... he rises and crosses to her. samuel watches from the table.}

<D>__{i have to help him!}
<A>__{rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try to load the bullets. eli's callused hand closes over hers, halting the action:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it is not our way!}
<A>__{bullets are already clattering to the floor from her trembling fingers as she raises her eyes to eli's. a long beat as rachel looks at him... finally her fingers release the pistol and it clatters to the floor. she closes her eyes. samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches eli and rachel silently. eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the bible beneath his. they stand there and they pray.}
