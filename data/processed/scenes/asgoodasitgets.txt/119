<L>__{interior carol's apartment building vestibule night}
<A>__{as melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the sudden blast of being buzzed into carol's life sounds. he bolts for the door and enters.}
<L>__{interior carol's apartment night}
<A>__{she opens the door... she hears the sound of melvin sounding heavily up the stairs... he reaches her side.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what do you want, melvin?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{were you asleep?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{'cause if you were asleep i'm sorry. and you could be grouchy.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{grouchy?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{... 'cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. so then i wouldn't even try.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what job?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{were you asleep?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{beverly in the hallway looking on }
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm sorry i woke you some other time.}
<A>__{he half turns to leave.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i wasn't asleep!!}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what a break...}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(losing it a bit)}
<D>__{is it a secret what you're doing here?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i had to see you...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{because...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it relaxes me... i'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine.}
<A>__{carol has not ever heard anything like that before... it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as we see in the b.g. that beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part... melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone...}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{wait a minute, i'm overstating here, maybe the inside stairs. i don't want to sit with my feet in the gutter. what does that serve? it only...}
<A>__{but suddenly carl is shouting to the heavens.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{stop it!! why can't i have a normal boyfriend??? why? get out of here. just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(butting in)}
<D>__{everybody wants that, dear it doesn't exit...}
<P>__{(as carol turns to her)}
<D>__{sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.}
<A>__{she disappears into her room. carol snorts a laugh gathers herself. a beat.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{boyfriend?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{maybe we could live without the wise cracks.}
<A>__{she looks at him then:}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{maybe we could...}
<A>__{melvin glances at the cracked pattern of carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it feels a little confined here. let's take a walk.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{see. it's four in the morning. a walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{if you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. there's a shot it'll open soon that way we're not screwy we're just two people who like warm rolls.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{okay.}
