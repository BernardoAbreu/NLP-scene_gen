<L>__{interior mark's car morning}
<A>__{a bleary eyed mark drives home from jennifer's. as he turns onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way. a massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking. mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building. standing by his door is the nurse from the hospital. she immediately points at mark and screams.}
<D>__{nurse #1 there he is!}
<A>__{mark is bum rushed by a question asking throng. all of them are pelting mark with questions, all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers.}
<D>__{person #1 is there only one place you go when you die? person #2 will everyone who has ever died be there? person #3 what's this place called? person #4 will i get to have sex with people there?}
<A>__{mark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. he gets to his door and opens it, only to have the nurse step in his path and block the door.}
<D>__{nurse #1 you owe us an explanation. if you know something this important, you better tell us all.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{who are you people? nurse #1 the words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. please, tell us more. explain what you said.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{fine, fine, just give me a minute.}
<A>__{mark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door behind him.}
