<D>__{you have your voting slips, gentlemen. please remember the americans are looking for something quite high powered. a doctorate preferably...}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door. bean enters. lord walton smiles. the rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. bean is very nervous indeed.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{ah, mr. bean. please take a seat for a moment. i have some news which will not, i'm afraid...}
<A>__{the phone rings. lord walton answers. bean sits next to vincent and sniffs at him. vincent's breath hasn't improved.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes? put him on... timothy. the computer ... yes... when? how? all of it? absolutely all of it? did you back it up? how long will it ... ? another six months. fair enough. come up here will you, dear boy.}
<A>__{he slowly hangs up. everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with the new computer the energy drains from them all as they contemplate another six months with bean still on the staff. lord walton coughs politely.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{as i was saying, gentlemen. the grierson gallery. south california. great opportunity. thousands of miles away though it is. doctorate or ( impishly ) no doctorate, perhaps}
<A>__{all get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting slips. the slips get handed down the line to lord walton. we see that every single slip has 'bean' on it.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{mr. bean. wonderful news. you are going to america.}
<C>__{mr. bean}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{ooooh, how lovely.}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door. the fat, bespectacled, programmer puts his head round it.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{ah, timothy. you're sacked.}
