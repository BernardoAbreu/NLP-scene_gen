<L>__{interior large ward day}
<A>__{this is a large, traditional hospital ward with a line of beds down each long wall and a wide central aisle. nearly all of the beds are occupied and, at the far end of the ward, there is a male patient in a wheelchair. all the patients' eyes turn immediately and happily to malahide as he crosses the room, continuing his speech.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{better? good.}
<A>__{he doesn't stop his progress but walks straight through the room and into the corridor. as the door closes behind him the wheelchair patient scowls.}
<D>__{w chair patient 105 years and he still doesn't know my name.}
