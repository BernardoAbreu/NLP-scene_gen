<A>__{the ship continues along smooth sunlit sea. land is in distant sight.}
<L>__{int stateroom }
<A>__{the cracked egg is nudged open. the cute scaly head of a six inch baby raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell. it shakes off a few pieces of clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the remaining eggs.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close on the wind up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor. it bands against the the wall again and again. timmy looks down at it and smiles at lex.}

<D>__{any candy behind the counter?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{hungry?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{starved.}
<A>__{timmy looks behind the counter. he sees boxes of goods. he moves a stack of umbrellas out of his way. lex gets up and pulls one out.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{let's go to the kitchen.}
<A>__{she smiles and pops to her feet. timmy's not sure.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{dr. grant said }
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{ let's go. we'll come right back.}
<A>__{close on timmy's torn face. he's hungry, too. he makes the right decision.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{nope. we're waiting here t}
<A>__{ill dr. grant}
<D>__{gets back. he'll help us get some }
<A>__{interrupted by a sound. a rhythmic, horrible breathing. now some light and rapid steps. and a sniffing. it's definitely an animal. lex backs off in a hurry. she knocks the umbrella over. it skirts across the floor. it spins and opens by itself. printed on it is the ferocious face of the spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills spinning to a stop. the breathing gets closer and closer. the children huddle together in a corner of the gift shop. they scream. it's a raptor, lean and ferocious. more like a cyborg than a hunter, it studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance. his eyes flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat. timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs. he winds one up and sends it off across the hall. the raptor glances over at the moving toy. timmy grabs another, whispers as he winds it.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{start winding now!}
<A>__{lex and timmy wind toy after toy, send th em across the hall. the raptor leaps, crushing one in its jaws. others waddle by. the raptor dodges and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one. the kids go running out into the hall. they race down the visitor center corridor. timmy pulls lex behind him toward the restaurant.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{the kitchen!}
