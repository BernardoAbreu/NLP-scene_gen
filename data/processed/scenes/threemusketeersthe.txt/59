<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{how considerate of the cardinal to provide us with a snack.}
<A>__{porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg. aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate box.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{aramis opens the box, reacts. it is filled with gold coins, jewelry.}

<P>__{(to the point)}
<D>__{throw the coins, boy. the people are hungry.}
<A>__{d'artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into the air. aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior. pedestrians see the gold, shout, and leap after. their hurried steps impede the guards' progress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. but several of the guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the carriage with renewed determination. d'artagnan hears a loud popping sound, ducks.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{they're firing at us!}
<A>__{porthos sticks his head into view, offers them a bubbling bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.}

<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the next right...?}
