<L>__{int hammond's quarters day}
<A>__{hammond peeks in the door and sees gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on the couch. gennaro's eyes flutter and hammond enters and smiles.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{he, donald. glad you're awake. i hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park. it would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up.}
<A>__{gennaro just grins and shakes his head. he's very high on morphine. he wants to speak but hammond keeps talking. after each sentence, gennaro enthusiastically agrees with a nod.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle. the park is actually quite safe. a disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment. arnold, muldoon, and wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage as we speak.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{oh good, 'cause i love the park! it's more than we ever dreamed! those brachiosaurs are so big! and those spitters }
<P>__{(he spits)}
<D>__{ incredible! i only have one problem. aren't we going to have pterodactyls?}
<P>__{(he frowns, smacks his forehead)}
<D>__{oh, they'd fly away!}
<A>__{gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away. hammond takes out a bag.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{take a look at these, donald. have you seen these? these are great.}
<A>__{hammond dumps things out of the bag. they are souvenirs of the park.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{wind up toys. spitter umbrellas.}
<A>__{gennaro is thrilled.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i got some great t shirts. dinosaur bingo, hey ...}
<A>__{hammond leans closer.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{wu says he can make a foot high triceratops. we'll sell pets as living souvenirs. bio engineered to eat only food we sell, of course.}
<A>__{gennaro can't take it. great idea! he high fives hammond repeatedly. harding enters and gently taps hammond on the shoulder.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{you'll have to bear with him, mr. hammond. he's doped to infinity and back.}
