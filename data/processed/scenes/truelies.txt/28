<L>__{exterior mountain slope night}
<A>__{harry sees the chopper start an attack run. he comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket. the chopper gets suckered in... trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle. p p p pow! he rakes a burst across the windshield. the startled pilot swerves and suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him. k whack! the main rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank. it slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering. firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across harry's path. harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it... running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots. he has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow. harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running. the ski patrol opens fire from upslope. rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter. harry looks down the slope and gets an idea. he jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. it slips over the edge. he leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope.}
