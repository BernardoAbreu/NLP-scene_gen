<L>__{exterior grauman's chinese theater hollywood night}
<A>__{it's spectacular! disney's biggest hollywood opening. bulbs flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red carpet. ushers are dressed as english bobbies. reporters stand on podiums in colourful suits, penguins dance their hearts out in front of the theater. pearly kings and queens play for the onlookers. crowds and crowds of fans scream every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and posters in the air. every disney character imaginable bounces up and down the lines of well wishers, hugging them, dancing for them, signing their booklets. hollywood blvd is completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest party you could ever go to.}
