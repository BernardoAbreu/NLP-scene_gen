<A>__{po and shifu ready their chopsticks. po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. back and forth, po and shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. until there is only one left. shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from po. he hides it underneath one of the bowls. he uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack po's chopsticks away. he attacks po with his bamboo staff. but po skillfully manages to best shifu for the final dumpling. shifu smiles. po has passed the final test. but then po tosses the dumpling into shifu's open hand.}
