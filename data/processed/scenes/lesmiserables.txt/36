<A>__{fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. we see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter, then fantine lays down.}

<D>__{easy money lying on a bed. just as well they never see the hate that's in your head! don't they know they're making love to one already dead?}

<A>__{close on a man's hand leaving money. we hear him exit. move to find fantine lying alone on the mattress. she pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. she draws her legs up and wraps her arms round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world.}

<D>__{there was a time when men were kind, when their voices were soft and their words inviting. there was a time when love was blind and the world was a song and the song was exciting. there was a time... then it all went wrong. i dreamed a dream in time gone by, when hope was high and life worth living. i dreamed that love would never die. i dreamed that god would be forgiving.}

<D>__{then i was young and unafraid and dreams were made and used and wasted. there was no ransom to be paid, no song unsung, no wine untasted. but the tigers come at night with their voices soft as thunder as they tear your hope apart as they turn your dream to shame. he slept a summer by my side, he filled my days with endless wonder. he took my childhood in his stride but he was gone when autumn came. and still i dream he'll come to me! that we will live the years together... but there are dreams that cannot be and there are storms we cannot weather... i had a dream my life would be so different from this hell i'm living so different now from what it seemed! now life has killed the dream i dreamed.}
