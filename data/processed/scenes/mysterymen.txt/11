<L>__{exterior residential street night}
<A>__{the shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. the front yard looks like a battle zone. bikes and kids' junk are everywhere. living room a moment later as big a disaster area as the front yard. his kids, eddie jr. (15), lenore (12), butch (10), tracy (7), and roland (5) are all sprawled in front of the television. the shoveler enters, and his kids don't even bother to look up from the tube.}
