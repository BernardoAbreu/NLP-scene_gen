<A>__{newt watches the face hugger emerge and turn toward her. ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap, and fires, blasting it with a burst from the assault rifle. the flash illuminates the figure of an adult warrior, nearby. it spins, moving straight for ripley. firing from the hip she drills it with two controlled bursts which catapult it back. she steps toward it, firing again. her expression is murderous. and again. it spins onto its back. she unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in a fireball. ripley runs to newt and begins tearing at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the child. she swings her up onto her back.}

<A>__{groggily newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts of ripley's battle harness as ripley picks up her weapon. more warriors are moving toward her among the eggs. she fires the flamethrower. the eggs are engulfed. one of the warriors lunges forward, a living fireball. she blasts it in half with two bursts from the m 41a. ripley retreats, ducking under a glistening cylindrical mass. a piercing shriek fill the chamber. she turns. and there it is. a massive silhouette in the mist, the alien queen glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black insect buddha. what's bigger and meaner than the alien? his momma. her fanged head is an unimaginable horror. her six limbs, the four arms and two powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her distended abdomen. the egg filled abdomen swells and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped carelessly among the machinery. ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before. inside the abdominal sac can be seen the forms of countless eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by drones. the drones are tiny scuttling albino versions of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen. ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher. she fires. pumps and fires again. four times. the grenades punch deep into the egg sac and explode, ripping it open from within. eggs are tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber floor. the queen goes berserk, screeching like some psychotic steam whistle. ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting everything in sight with an insane fury. eggs shrivel in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing. over all is the queen's shrieking as she struggles in the flames. two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on her. she pulls the trigger...an empty click. digital counter flashing crimson zeroes. she drops the magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home and opens up. the creatures vanish in rapid fire flashes. ripley backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye searing expenditure of energy. then she dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal instinct.}
