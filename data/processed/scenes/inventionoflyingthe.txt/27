<L>__{interior martha schiffman's room day}
<A>__{an elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her bed, with her back to mark, staring at the wall only inches from her face.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh grandma, that is so depressing. come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something.}
<A>__{mark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the other side of her bed.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{the television is broken.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the television isn't broken. you probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again.}
<A>__{mark flicks on the tv with the remote. static fills the screen. he changes the channel and a picture comes into view.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{see, you had it on the wrong channel. it needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. but i also love you and wish things were better for you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i do too.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{grandma, i lost my job today. i'm forty years old. i'm completely alone and i've got absolutely no prospects for anything.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mark. things aren't any better for me here. i can't afford most of my medication, i'm very alone and i forget more and more every day.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm just so tired of life. why does life have to be so... what's the word? don't you sometimes wish you could change things? don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't think i'm a loser.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{of course you're a loser, grandma. our family is made up of losers. we're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. we're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. and we're only lonely and unloved right now. remember, i've had two husbands i loved very much in my lifetime.}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{and maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm not talking about the past, grandma. i'm talking about right now. and right now we're both losers, grandma. we're both shitty, shitty losers. don't you know that?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i suppose we are. but things could be worse. we could be homeless.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd rather be dead than be homeless. that's why i need to get out there and find a job. if i have to be homeless, i'm going to kill myself.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well that's sad. i love you, mark. good luck finding a job!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i love you too, grandma.}
<A>__{mark leaves. as he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static.}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{oops.}
