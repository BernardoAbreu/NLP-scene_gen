<A>__{raymond and ellie. through the wavy glass we see a crowded dining room, the ever present secret service.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no. that'd be political suicide. of course not. i want you to help him.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i can't even imagine why.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{because i feel sorry for him. because i said i would.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what should we do? make him a general?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{mother. look. my campaign people are getting a restraining order, he's going on all the security watch lists but i won't lock him up. i'm not pressing charges.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{raymond}

<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you don't actually believe his story?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no. but he does. and he's a fine soldier and ... my friend. and if his slim hold on sanity requires that i tolerate his delusions until he can get help, i will do it. it doesn't diminish me. and i'm not afraid of him.}

<A>__{she starts to cut meat into child like, bite sized pieces and put them on a side plate, for raymond.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{the steak part is mostly for you. doesn't it look yummy?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{my god. in the world's literature of food could there possibly be a more vulgar dish?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{and eating it is an absolute sexual experience. try some.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{promise me that you'll help him.}
<A>__{ellie stops, sighs, puts her fork down and reaches for the oversized satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh, raymond, how much do you really know about your friend?}
<A>__{ellie finds two thick files and plops them down, as punctuation, in front of raymond.}
