<L>__{interior harry's bedroom night}
<A>__{harry is in bed, eyes closed. doc lardner has a stethoscope to his chest. he leans up and pats harry's hand. he stands and comes over to luke and adele, who are near the door. just outside, angling for a view into the room, are old tim and mrs. terwilliger.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{it's a pretty massive heart attack. his lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{can we get him to the hospital?}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.}
<P>__{(puts his hand on luke's shoulder)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{harry's eyelids flutter.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{did you... did you...}
<A>__{luke rushes to harry's side and takes his hand.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did you... did you...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{did i what?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{did you fix the damn film? it broke in the last reel.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i know. everyone went home. we offered them refunds.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{anybody take it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{a few.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(closes his eyes)}
<D>__{vultures...}
<A>__{luke smiles.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not happy about this, mind you, but if i have to go, at least i'm going in my own bed, the same bed my lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. that's not too shabby, is it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't tell me, i know about these things. i've seen it before. it's all right. it's... all right. you're here. oh, god, i love you, son.}
<A>__{harry smiles. luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering in harry's ear:}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and i love you... dad.}
<A>__{harry smiles faintly, looks at luke. he nods, then closes his eyes.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh, so... much... lighter...}
<A>__{slowly, harry exhales. his face relaxes, completely at peace. he doesn't breathe again. luke looks at harry's face for a moment. then as the tears well up, he leans over and ever so gently places a kiss on harry's forehead.}
