<L>__{interior munson house foyer later (evening)}
<A>__{the bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; mrs. munson is seeing them off at the door. evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow. the men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, wave off the departing ladies.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{goodbye, ladies. we had such a pleasant time.}
<A>__{mrs. munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{now, i wanna know what's goin' on.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. though in this instance, i believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{hmph.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{you see lump here is an enthusiastic collector of indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas i myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs" and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the general here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette.}
<A>__{the general stiffly bows:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{so sorry.}
<A>__{the professor, nodding, smiling, and dry washing his hands, continues to look at mrs. munson, though his story, apparently, has ended. she returns his ingratiating look with a stare.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...what about all that money?}
<A>__{dorr's smile fades.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...ah. the money. the money is... mr. pancake's.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{he only just re mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common law wife, mountain water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. mr. pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in mr. pancake's case, in a hefty bag that is his constant companion.}
<A>__{under her stare, he elaborates:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...steel sack.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{don't trust the banks. never have.}
<A>__{she thinks, decides.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{this don't smell right. i'm callin' sheriff wyner.}
<A>__{a chorus of gasps.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{madam if you please. yes! yes! it was a lie! a fantastic tale! you have us! dead to rights! but please allow me to tell you the truth in private.}
