<D>__{as soon as this is over, i will be gone.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what a great big surprise that is.}

<C>__{mills }
<D>__{mills and somerset are on the premises.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{wonder fucking ful.}
<A>__{mills stops, looks. somerset stops, looks back down the stairs. john doe stands inside the precinct house doors. he holds out his arms as if to say "presto, here i am." near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of john doe. mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend. one uniformed cop takes out his gun, points it at john doe.}
<C>__{uniformed cop}
<D>__{it's him!}
<A>__{several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons. mills, still off balance, walks back through the gate, takes his gun out and points it at doe.}

<C>__{another cop}
<D>__{you heard him! get on the floor!}

<D>__{spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{get down! face down!}
<A>__{john doe gets on his stomach, obeys. mills comes right up to doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against doe's head.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{don't move. don't move a fucking inch.}
<A>__{cops frisk and handcuff doe. somerset comes beside mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{hello, lieutenant somerset.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{the cop putting the handcuffs on doe holds up doe's hands. doe winces. every single one of doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped around it. john doe looks up, his face pressed against the floor, glasses askew, mills' gun at his temple.}

<D>__{i want to speak with my lawyer.}
