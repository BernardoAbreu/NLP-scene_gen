<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom moments later}
<A>__{vick and alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold ensconsed men's room, watching stu painfully undo his jeans.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i can't believe we're doing this.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you don't have to look up my butt, just at it. something is terribly, terribly wrong...}
<A>__{stu's jeans fall to the ground and everyone freezes. he's wearing a snug fluorescent pink g string with "i roger" written vertically down the front. in glitter.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{sweet mother of mercy...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{who's roger?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i i i don't know?! what do you think it means?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{what do i think it means? well, stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude i don't think we need the csi team for this one! you got reamed last night, man!}
<A>__{stu covers his mouth, horrified!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{really?! what?!}
<A>__{alan tries to think of one.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, maybe there isn't.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{look, i'm sure roger is a very nice, considerate young man }
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{oh my god, guys: what if i'm gay?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{come on, stu, you're nowhere near cool enough.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(gasping, realizing)}
<D>__{i do watch dancing with the stars with the kids!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{but sort of...it does?}
<A>__{stu grows increasingly frantic.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{and once, i caught myself gazing at a topless photo of david beckham!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{so what, he's a great looking dude }
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{and then i had those weird feelings for vick that time in middle school, remember?!}
<A>__{everyone stops. vick most of all.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{um, what?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, that weekend we were all camping i told you this.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{yeah, no you didn't.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i didn't?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i think i'd remember, dude.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, i think we'd all remember.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah. i had weird feelings for you that weekend. like really hot, really gay feelings. but then they went away.}
<A>__{vick is just looking at him, stunned.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{wait i was there that weekend. did you have gay feelings for me?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what?! i was a good looking kid!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{please, you're so not his type!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{wait, what?}
<A>__{just then, a father and his young son enter the men's room and see stu standing there, pants down, in his g string...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{look, stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? a lot of guys test the waters.}
<A>__{...the father and son wheel right back around and exit.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{all right, we're scaring the children. let's go.}
<A>__{the guys head for the door. stu quickly pulls up his pants.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{wait so have either of you tested the waters?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{no! we're not gay!}
<A>__{stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto}
<B>__{the casino floor}
<A>__{the guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit. stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{how am i going to tell my wife?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{quickly, and from a great distance.}
<A>__{alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and clinks...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jesus, what kind of father am i?}
<A>__{alan's hand clinks against the railing again, and this time it registers. alan looks down and stops cold.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(really scared)}
<D>__{you think erin will try to take the kids ?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{oh...my...god.}
<C>__{vick}
<P>__{(turning, annoyed)}
<D>__{what now?}
<A>__{alan holds up the source of his clinking: on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver wedding ring with a unicorn on it.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{cool ring. also, my dad is gonna have a field day with this.}
<A>__{vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards alan.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{oh my god... oh my god...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what's the big ?}
<P>__{(finally realizing)}
<D>__{oh! oh! oh!}
<A>__{alan steadies himself against a slot machine, and shakily takes off the massive unicorn ring.}
<C>__{stu }
<D>__{maybe it's not a wedding ring?}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(reading inscription)}
<D>__{"to my noble husband, alan."}
<A>__{the guys eyes bulge, oh shit!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{this is worse than my underwear!}
<A>__{vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{"now & forever wedding chapel."}
<A>__{they guys exchange a look.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{well, at least it's a lead.}
<A>__{beat. then alan turns and throws up all over the slot machine. nearby octogenarian slot players look over, disgusted but continue playing their nickels.}
