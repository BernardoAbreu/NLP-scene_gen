<A>__{hey stu, where's the action this weekend?}
<D>__{supervisor stu}
<A>__{we're getting big money on tampa oakland. everyone's jumping on tampa bay.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{crazy. supervisor stu you think?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{that game's gonna be won by coaching, stu. gruden put that tampa bay team together before he came to oakland, right? he knows every weakness of that team and every strength. he knows brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double teamed to the right. he knows gannon always throws on a 3 step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field. gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on sunday. (stu staring at him, pained look) ...you got sucked into tampa, didn't you? (stu manages a nod) stu, how many times do i have to bail you out? all right, listen, forget the point spread. oakland's going to win outright. bet the money line and bet big.}
