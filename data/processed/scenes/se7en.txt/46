<L>__{exterior city street, porno district night}
<A>__{a bright, tawdry intersection. neon swirls and circuit bulbs on porno theatres provide the flash. cars, taxies, and barkers urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise. the streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards: fun with nudes, big boobs, naked desire, etc. the usual contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for someone to hurt. move through the crowds. meet john, a balding, middle aged man, wearing thick glasses. there is not a single thing strange or unusual about his appearance. follow him as he walks. he's nervous, looking at the porno palaces. his sweaty hand clutches a bible tight against his chest. he doesn't feel comfortable being here. john walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross. a grotesque street preacher approaches waving his own bible. people walk away from him, so he confronts john.}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{...are you, sir? is jesus christ your lord and master? do you believe in him?}
<A>__{john tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.}
<C>__{preacher }
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{don't ignore me. listen to what i have to say. christ can be your savior!}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(quiet anger)}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{think about god, sir. i can help you let him into your life.}
<A>__{finally the light changes. john turns and spits in the preacher's face. the preacher recoils as john crosses quickly. john hurries between cars in the crosswalk. the preacher curses from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.}
