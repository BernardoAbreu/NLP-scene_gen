<A>__{close shot warrior #1 as he looks to ash. med. shot warriors they follow his gaze. the camera pans to ash. he stands alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering shotgun. he looks about dazedly. he tries to get his bearings. wide shot warriors they falter. unsure of how to react to this strange man, who a moment before was pronounced a deadite. from the crowd, the warrior #1 calls out:}
<D>__{warrior #1 hail he, who has come from the sky, to deliver us from the terrors of the deadites! warrior #4 hail! warrior #5 hail!}
<A>__{the cry is taken up by all. a line of medieval warriors bow. then twenty. then fifty. all remove their helmets and kneel silently in the dust. somewhere in the distance a drum sounds. ash stands frozen. terrified, unsure of where or when he is. knowing only for the present, he is alive. as the wind kicks up blowing dust, ash strikes a familiar pose. it is the same image of the "hero from the sky" that we saw earlier in the film. the strange "jagged edged longsword" is ash's chainsaw. the camera pulls back from him as a great medieval castle rears up into frame. it is seen to be the castle of kandar. the same castle we saw in the beginning of the film. now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand new. as the camera continues to pull back from ash, the title "evil dead" appears on the screen acompanied by the distant roar of some dying animal: the screen cuts to black with a thunderous boom .}
