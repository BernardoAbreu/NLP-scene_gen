<L>__{exterior interior quaid's offices stairwell night}
<A>__{the tarot card and crystal readings sign is dark now. harry heads up the stairs, past the photographs, to the door of quaid's waiting room. it has been locked and taped by the police. harry has come prepared. he takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks.}
<L>__{interior quaid's offices waiting fortune telling rooms night}
<A>__{harry enters, flashlight on. he crosses the waiting room and enters the fortune telling room where quaid died. on the track a remote, eerie presence we hear quaid's sobs, miller's shouts, and, as harry's flashlight illuminates the blood spattered table:}
<C>__{butterfield }
<D>__{if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping.}
<A>__{harry is spooked. he starts to search the room, opening cabinets and drawers. quaid's hordes of mystical bric a brac are stashed everywhere. boxes of crystals, religious statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc. he pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged in a niche at the base of the drawer. he pulls the drawer out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart. it has a false bottom.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(smiles)}

<D>__{you didn't hire me. she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{she doesn't want to see you. she's had enough pain. enough churning over the past. she wants it all left alone.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{left alone? somebody's been murdered.}
