<L>__{exterior travis' taxi speed down darkened street.}
<A>__{travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the plaza.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{i called betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. that's my day off. at first she hesitated, but i called her again and she agreed.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{betsy. betsy what? i forgot to ask her last name again. damn. i've got to remember stuff like that.}
<A>__{travis' thoughts are with betsy, as three men enter travis' cab. he activates the meter and pulls off.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{st. regis hotel.}
<A>__{travis checks the mirror. scanning across the back seat, he recognizes the middle passenger. it is charles palantine, candidate for president. he must have left the hotel shortly after betsy. tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks deferentially to palantine:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's 12:30 now. you'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins.}
<A>__{palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an earlier conversation.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{i don't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from california.}
<A>__{travis recognizes his passenger. he puts out his cigarette.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{say, aren't you charles palantine, the candidate?}
<C>__{palantine}
<P>__{(only mildly irritated)}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well, i'm one of your biggest supporters. i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.}
<C>__{palantine}
<P>__{(pleased; glances to check travis' license)}
<D>__{why, thank you travis.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll win, sir. everybody i know is going to vote for you.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.}
<C>__{palantine}
<P>__{(pleasant)}
<D>__{i will tell you, travis, i've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of general motors.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{and in some other places too...}
<A>__{palantine, his assistant and tom all laugh. palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to travis:}
<C>__{palantine}
<D>__{travis, what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i don't know, sir. i don't follow political issues much.}
<C>__{palantine}
<D>__{there must be something...}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{well, he should clean up this city here. it's full of filth and scum. scum and filth. it's like an open sewer. i can hardly take it.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{some days i go out and smell it then i get headaches that just stay and never go away. we need a president that would clean up this whole mess. flush it out.}
<A>__{palantine is not a hubert humphrey type professional bullshitter, and travis' intense reply stops him dead in his tracks. he is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning.}
<C>__{palantine}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i know what you mean, travis, and it's not going to be easy. we're going to have to make some radical changes.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(turning the wheel)}
<D>__{damn straight.}
