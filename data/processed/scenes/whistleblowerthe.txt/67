<L>__{exterior women's medica shelter sarajevo suburbs night}
<A>__{a run down community center nestled in a shabby area outside the city. it's completely unassuming. from the outside, you might think it was abandoned.}
<L>__{interior hallway women's medica shelter moments later}
<A>__{the shelter is a converted gymnasium. peeling wallpaper. long forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. patchy linoleum curls at the edges. a soft hum. voices in rooms that kathy can't see. she walks down the hall with milena, 40s, bosnian, down to earth, forthright.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{these girls are told they have been bought and must repay the debt. they are told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll be let go when they earn back that money. but they never are.}
<A>__{kathy stares at her, taken aback.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{sex trafficking is one of the worst things to happen after this war.}
<A>__{milena hands over a medical report.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{raya has a severe internal infection. the doctor found (reading) "intentionally placed foreign objects causing a disruption of the vaginal wall".}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{foreign objects?}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{coins. she's not the first. men can feel deficient paying for sex, so they find other ways to feel powerful.}
<A>__{milena pushes through a door. to a dark hallway... hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. they walk. avoiding dripping leaks in the roof.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{we gave her penicillin, but the doctor is worried there could be something more serious.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{when will he know?}
<A>__{they pass an eating area. teen girls sit, pick at food, chain smoke and flip through magazines. they are clean, but weak.}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{unfortunately that's all we can do for her. we're just a volunteer organization.}
<A>__{kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{but if there are so many victims.}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{we lost our funding because of those.}
<A>__{...she points at a basket of condoms near the coffee.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{it's the u.s. department of state. they have their rules. i will do anything to give these girls some protection. but the department of state thinks "condoms encourage prostitution." ngos caught giving them out, no longer receive us funding.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{but these girls aren't prostitutes.}
<A>__{milena shrugs.}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{they don't realize the cycle they start. if there are no condoms in the bars...}
<A>__{they pass a room divider. seeing... more girls. in their teens. all broken. and desperate.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{...the guys want to find ways of avoiding stds. aids. their solution? pay more for virgins...}
<A>__{kathy sees a girl sit in a corner. she couldn't be more than ten years old. she sits alone.}
<C>__{milena }
<D>__{so the traffickers bring more in. younger and younger. now it's a global industry. simple economics. if there is demand, you supply.}
<A>__{milena opens a door, revealing... inside the room: a volunteer nurse sits by raya's bed. she lies asleep. in another bed: irka sleeps. kathy watches. hushed...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{where can they get help?}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{try the global displacement agency. they have good medical care, lots of funding. they might take them. whether they'll keep them or not... i don't know.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{where are the other girls from the florida bar?}
<A>__{milena looks at her. blank.}
<C>__{kathy }
<D>__{the local police were bringing them here.}
<C>__{milena}
<D>__{those girls never arrived.}
