<L>__{interior tea room twenty minutes later evening}
<A>__{vicki, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. a waiter brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, bearing a single word: urgent.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{miss vale, this just arrived for you.}
<A>__{as the waiter leaves, she tears off the wrapper. inside is a small white box and a note scribbled in crayon. dear v. vale,}
<B>__{put this on right now.}
<A>__{unsigned, of course. vicki, puzzled, opens the box to find a miniature gas mask. she hears a strange hissing noise. a few feet away, green smoke is billowing out of an air conditioning vent. trays of food crash to the floor as waiters pass out. art lovers drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad. vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.}
