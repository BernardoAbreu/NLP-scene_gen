<L>__{interior the ball, moscow night}
<A>__{kitty enters the ball, a proper lady. this is a gilded affair, conducted by a master of ceremonies. the host and hostess are positioned to welcome each guest. dancing has started a waltz. kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts. everything has come together for kitty her dress, her hair, her skin, her moment. she radiates happiness. an officer stands aside to let them pass, openly admiring kitty, smoothing his moustache. a youth having trouble with his white tie hurries past but turns back to kitty.}
<C>__{youth}
<D>__{kitty! may i have a waltz?}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{you may, boris. i will save you the third just because it's your first ball.}
<C>__{youth}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{you're my first conquest.}
<A>__{the master of ceremonies, korsunsky, arrives and without permission sweeps her into the waltz.}
<C>__{korsunsky}
<D>__{it's a relaxation to dance with you, princess.}
<A>__{kitty sees anna arriving with oblonsky and gives a little gasp at her god given beauty.}
<C>__{korsunsky }
<D>__{but back to work! where do you want to be taken?}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{korsunsky waltzes her brilliantly through the dancers and twirls her to rest in front of a small group including anna and oblonsky floating kitty's train.}
<C>__{korsunsky}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{so that your ankles may be seen.}
<A>__{anna appraises kitty at a glance and gives her a tiny nod signifying top marks. kitty glows.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{how are you, stiva?}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{thanks to anna, i am a happy man. would you like to dance?}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{no, ask anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(demurs)}
<D>__{no . . . i don't . . .}
<A>__{she looks up and sees vronsky coming straight towards her.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{come on then.}
<A>__{just as vronsky is about to bow, she takes oblonsky's arm and he whirls her away. kitty smiles for vronsky but his eyes have followed anna, know ing she cut him. he remembers himself after an awkward hiatus. kitty's mother and father are watching from afar. vronsky obliges. he invites her into the waltz.}
<C>__{prince shcherbatsky}
<D>__{. . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours . . .}
<C>__{princess shcherbatsky}
<D>__{for goodness' sake, what have i done?}
<C>__{prince shcherbatsky}
<D>__{levin is a thousand times better than this petersburg fop. if he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him!}
<A>__{vronsky's mind is absent and the waltz ends after only a few steps. he stand waiting for the music to start.}
<C>__{kitty}
<D>__{is anything the matter?}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{no. you look . . . as lovely as ever, princess kitty.}
<A>__{the music starts and they dance on. at the end of the waltz, vronsky leaves kitty with her mother, bows and departs. princess shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts. she starts to ask.}
<C>__{kitty}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{don't ask me, maman!}
<A>__{boris the youth pops up to claim his dance. dancing, kitty sees vronsky talking to a couple of officers. she is anxious but not disillusioned. grumpy prince shcherbatsky is dancing with countess nordston.}
<C>__{countess nordston}
<D>__{he'll dance the mazurka with kitty, you'll see. i call the mazurka the now or never.}
<A>__{anna watches the dancing. she rejects an offer with a smile. she sees vron sky and to her discomfort vronsky looks up and catches her looking. she turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are bowing as the host and hostess escort an overweight but glittering young couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the austrian royal honeymooners . . . attended by the guards officer from the station. anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon . . . where oblonsky is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.}
<C>__{austrian princess}
<D>__{. . . we were shut up in the train for an hour!}
<A>__{anna steals a sidelong glance towards vronsky but he is no longer there. she looks for him among the dancers, smiles at kitty going by with the enthusiastic, inexpert boris. suddenly, vronsky is at anna's side.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{dance with me.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i am not used to being spoken to like that by a man i met once at a railway station.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{i dare say, but if i'm not to dance with you, i'm getting out of this operetta and going home.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{then, for kitty's sake.}
<A>__{she gives him her hand. kitty looks for vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with anna. kitty watches anna dancing. anna says something which makes vronsky laugh. anna laughs. anna blossoms in front of kitty's eyes. vron sky twirls anna around and she comes smiling into his arms. it goes on like that. kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall. anna and vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked. others are noticing too: countess nordston, princess shcherbatsky, and eagle eyed matrons. anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself. countess nordston finds kitty sitting alone. korsunsky announces the mazurka.}
<C>__{countess nordston}
<D>__{you're not dancing the mazurka? i won't have it.}
<A>__{she pulls kitty to her feet.}
<P>__{countess nordston (cont'd)}
<D>__{i'm engaged by general glub i give him to you.}
<B>__{the mazurka . . .}
<A>__{korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle.}
<C>__{korsunsky}
<D>__{. . . the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . !}
<A>__{the lady in the middle beckons to anna and the man who, changing part ners, happens to be dancing with her. they enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum ference. anna is flushed with pleasure. among the surrounding dancers, vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for anna. kitty, dancing, watches vronsky incredulous.}
<C>__{korsunsky }
<P>__{(addressing anna)}
<D>__{. . . and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . !}
<A>__{anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees kitty staring at her. anna "wakes up." everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant. she waits until the change of partners brings kitty and vronsky together. she beckons them into the middle. her own partner expects to re join the circumference with anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door. with a howl and clatter, the st. petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{an abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame light on wood, glass, iron . . . blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut. anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike.}
