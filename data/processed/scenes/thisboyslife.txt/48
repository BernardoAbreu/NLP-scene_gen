<A>__{caroline, toby, marian and kathy sit at the table eating dinner.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{... exactly what i wanted for my dress. it's a simplicity pattern, and i'm pretty sure i can make it myself. it's got big puff sleeves...}
<A>__{caroline takes out a cigarette. then everybody jumps as toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over backwards.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{toby grabs caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate dwight: saying, "oh!" and "oh, yes!" and oh, my!" and "here, let me!" and "i will do that!" it's a mean, accurate imitation of dwight. all three women laugh in spite of themselves. caroline keeps saying "jack, that's enough," and marian says, "dwight's not that bad." but they can't help laughing. toby offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom, the back door, and the refrigerator a light.}
