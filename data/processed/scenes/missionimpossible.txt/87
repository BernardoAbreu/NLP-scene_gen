<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{ethan slides into the back seat, between the two men. matthias, the man on the left, holds up a black hood. he extends it to ethan, who doesn't take it.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{would you remove your hat please?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{you wish to meet max? this is the price of admission.}
<A>__{reluctantly, ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off.}
<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{the black hood still on his head, ethan has trouble sitting upright. he's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn. the place is roomy and lavishly furnished expensive oriental rugs, well chosen objects of art. somewhere down the block, a dog barks, steadily, every few seconds. in the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is vacuuming. matthias and the other man are nearby.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i thought i was going to see max.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{you misunderstood. no one sees max.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{then what am i doing here?}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{allowing max to see you and hear what you've got to say.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't communicate very well through a shroud.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{if max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i'm willing to take the chance.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{max's figure into frame. matthias removes ethan's hood. when it comes off ethan finds himself looking up at a tall woman of indeterminate age. she's handsome to the point of severity.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{who are you and what are you doing here?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i need one hundred thousand dollars.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{really? and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{why not? you gave job a hundred and twenty five thousand.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the penny drops. you are not job. yes, job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications. and there was its tone aggressive but playful. job is not playful. so you're something of a paradox.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that depends.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{on what?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{whether you like a paradox. i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's quite out of the question.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{the disk job sold you is worthless. it's bait, part of an internal molehunt.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{and how might you know that? are you another company man?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{like job?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ah, but, we're asking about you.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i'm noc. was. now disavowed.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{why, may i ask?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that's the question i want to ask job.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't know job any more than he knows me.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{even so, i'm sure you could arrange an introduction.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{why should i?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{because i can deliver the actual noc list. the one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. not a tenable position, sir.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(pause.)}
<D>__{mm hmmm...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{tell you what. how good's the rf scanner you used in the car?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{very good.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{okay, use it. but i suggest pack up first.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{matthias boots up. there's a little musical noise and the screen brightens. the computer whirs and clicks and a complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by. but matthias is watching the digital read out on the rf scanner.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{twenty six, twenty seven. so far so good.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's not so good for you, my friend.}
<A>__{on the scanner, the digital read out is now in the thirties.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{thirty two and change.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to ethan)}
<D>__{doesn't mean it's a signal. could just be the hard drive heating up.}
<A>__{she looks from the scanner to ethan as if she's trying to make up her mind about something.}
<C>__{matthias}
<D>__{forty four. forty five.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i'd say you've got about two minutes.}
<A>__{max still doubts it. the other man goes to the windows nothing happens. he opens the french doors that lead out onto a balcony.}
