<C>__{dante}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer. i will bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{if title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, i wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. but i did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. hence, even though i'm a clerk in this video store, i choose to go rent videos at big choice.}

<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{what am i worried about? he'll probably be glad i started the ball rolling. all he ever did was complain about her anyway. i'm just looking out for his best interests. i mean, that's what a friend does, am i right? i did him a favor.}

<D>__{a couple...?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(throws purse at him)}
<D>__{i'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! and if you think that thirty seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: i'm going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{would you let me explain...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{explain what? how you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?}

<D>__{you're damn right it's not like that! because i won't let it be like that! you want your slut? fine! the slut is yours!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i don't want caitlin...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you don't know what you want, but i'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! i've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you. everyone said it was a stupid move, but i didn't care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i don't want to go back with her...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{of course not; not now! you're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. well, i won't let you. i want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. and when she dumps you again and she will, dante, i promise you that when she dumps you again, i want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!}

<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dante and randal later, out of breath, on the floor. randal sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. dante lies on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies, ripped open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.}

<D>__{how's your eye?}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}

<D>__{you didn't have to choke me.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i thought i was doing you a favor.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so i figured i'd help you out.}

<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you still didn't have to choke me.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{oh please! i'm surprised i didn't kill you.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why do i say that? randal...forget it.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{no, really. what did i do that was so wrong?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what don't you do? randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what time did you get to work today?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{like ten after.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you were over half an hour late. then all you do is come over here.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{to talk to you.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{which means the video store is ostensibly closed.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{it's not like i'm miles away.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{hermaphrodites! i rented it so we could watch it together!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and i have to patch everything up. you get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. to top it all off, you ruin my relationship. what's your encore? do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?}
<C>__{dante }
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you know what the real tragedy is? i'm not even supposed to be here today!}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(suddenly outraged)}
<D>__{fuck you. fuck you, pal. listen to you trying to pass the buck again. i'm the source of all your misery. who closed the store to play hockey? who closed the store to attend a wake? who tried to win back an ex girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? you wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.}
<P>__{(beat, as dante)}
<D>__{"i'm not even supposed to be here today."}
<P>__{(whips stuff at dante)}
<D>__{you sound like an asshole. whose choice was it to be here today? nobody twisted your arm. you're here today of your own violation, my friend. but you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders that the store would crumble if dante wasn't here. well, i got news for you, jerk: this store would survive without you. without me either. all you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: you push fucking buttons. any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. you work in a convenience store, dante. and badly, i might add. and i work in a shitty video store. badly, as well.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, that guy jay's got it right he has no delusions about what he does. us? we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or god forbid cigarettes. we look down on them, as it we're so advanced. well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?}
<A>__{randal gets up, leaving dante to contemplate his strong words alone.}

<D>__{you need a ride?}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(looks out door)}
<D>__{got one. just pulled up.}
<A>__{they stand in silence. then...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{do you work tomorrow?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{same time. what about you?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm calling out. going to hit the hospital see how caitlin is. then try to see veronica.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night...after i get out of here?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i will call you. let you know.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{all right. good luck with veronica. if you want, i can talk to her, you know, and explain...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no thanks. i will take care of it. we've got a lot of shit to talk about.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{helluva day.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{to say the least.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{do you need a hug or something? 'cause i would have no hang ups about hugging you...you know, you being a guy and all. just don't knead my ass when you do it.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{get the fuck outta here already.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i'm gone. i will talk to you tomorrow.}
<A>__{randal exits. a second later, he reenters and tosses dante the sheet sign.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you're closed.}
<A>__{he exits. dante pushes the sign over from open to closed. dante climbs behind the counter. he pops the register open and starts counting the drawer out. the door is heard opening. pov john: dante counting out the register, not looking up.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what'd you forget something?}
<P>__{(looks up, surprised)}
<D>__{oh. i'm sorry, we're closed.}
<A>__{a gunshot blasts out. dante flies back, his chest exploding. he stares ahead and slumps to the floor. john walks behind the counter, stepping over dante's body on the floor, and takes the money out of the register. he grabs a paper bag and jams the money in it. he grabs handfuls of change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the frame. dante continues to lie on the floor.}
<B>__{credits}
<A>__{credits end, and the door is heard opening. a customer comes to the counter and stands there. he waits, looks around for a clerk, looks down the aisles.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{hello? little help?}
<A>__{no reply. he looks around again, and glances at the door to make sure nobody's coming in. then he reaches behind the counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. he leaves.}
