<L>__{interior club. night}
<A>__{a mass of dancing bodies fills the floor. the music is very loud. at the side of the dance floor sit tommy and spud. the look rather gloomy. there is an empty seat beside each of them. spud is drinking heavily. tommy turns and speaks to spud. his lips move but nothing is audible. spud is not ever aware that tommy has spoken. tommy bellows in spud's ear. tommy's words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club appear as subtitles, the character's communications somewhere between speech and mime.}
