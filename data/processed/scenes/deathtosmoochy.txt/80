<D>__{who's your favorite rhino?}
<A>__{an explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the bleachers.}
<C>__{kids in bleachers}
<D>__{smoochy!!!}
<A>__{the lights come up as the smoochyland band plays a strong, dramatic version of "battle hymn of the republic." after a moment, smoochy slowly rises from a lift under the stage. a giant sign above the jungle lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. it reads: welcome home smoochy!}
<B>__{angle on smoochyland band}
<A>__{a beaming spinner dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.}
<B>__{back on smoochy}
<A>__{he majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids who are giving him a standing ovation. the song crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the smoochyland band who sing, "his truth is marching on!" thunderous applause from the bleachers. smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat. it's very quiet in the studio now. smoochy, looking uncharacteristically serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down. he's in black limbo.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{thank you. it's good to be back. you know, kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair. a place where nice guys don't just finish last... they get their heads cut off.}
<A>__{gasps from the bleachers.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{that pretty world you think you know is just props and scenery. lollipop trees with roots in venom!}
<A>__{angle nora watches nervously from offstage.}

<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{so look around you, boys and girls. every day. be diligent! stand strong! as the old proverb says: beat a dog one time too many and you get a wolf! let's start howling! howl for me, boys and girls!}
<A>__{the kids in the bleachers howl along with smoochy.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{okay, i just wanted to get that off my chest. who wants to do the hokey pokey?!}
<A>__{the kids cheer as the smoochyland band launches into the hokey pokey song and smoochy starts dancing. the kids pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. everyone is dancing and having a ball. nora is clapping to the music offstage. sheldon and nora exchange affectionate glances.}
