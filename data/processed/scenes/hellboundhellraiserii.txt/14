<L>__{interior operating room night}
<A>__{a somewhat antiquated and frightening operating room, filled with machines, monitors, and surgical instruments. the corners of the room fall away to shadow. sitting upright in the centre of the room is a female patient. she is awake and staring out at the camera. twin probes clamps are in each of her ears to hold her in place. her head is shaved and the skin on the back of her head has been cut open and peeled apart. the flaps of the skin are held away from the area being worked on by four clamps. (we never actually see round to the exposed brain itself) immediately behind her, and probing with professional skill and coolness into her exposed brain, is doctor malahide. he is in his late forties and looks like all the great doctors look rational, civilized, competent, and powerful. there is an intensity in his eyes and the lines of his face though that suggests something more than normal. the room has several attentive listeners and observers, but the one nearest to malahide is his personal student assistant kyle macrae, young, conventionally good looking, with an open, friendly, face. malahide is holding forth on the secrets of his trade, several times looking away from his patient while still working on her, to make sure his audience understand his points.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{we can bring them back properly more often than scientific orthodoxy dictates, ladies and gentlemen. and the knife, far from the enemy of of analysis, is often its greatest ally in solving the puzzles of psychosis. analysis isolates and massages. surgery pinpoints and corrects. ... though you've got to know what you're doing, of course...}
<A>__{polite laughter from several students.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{some things are obvious. here, for example, ...}
<A>__{he prods in at a specific area.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{...are the optical motor nerve control centers.}
<A>__{the patient begins to blink in time with malahide's prodding. the affect is half comical, half distressing. perhaps malahide carries it on just that half second too long for innocent demonstration. but the students give impressed murmurs anyway.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{now. this case. a deeply buried psychosis severe enough to produce frighteningly frequent hysteria and aggression. incurable. say others. not so. analysis isolates. the knife exposes. medication controls.}
<A>__{as he speaks, malahide injects a syringe directly into the patient's brain. her face spasms momentarily. malahide stands back slightly. his face is serene, calm, and confident. he takes a small, motorised drill and sets to work on the brain.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{and then, ladies and gentlemen, we rebuild. with all the care and knowledge that our years of training have given us ...}
<A>__{he looks around at them all, smiling slightly.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{... we bring them back.}
<A>__{the students murmur their approval. perhaps they even applaud. malahide acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod. suddenly, an intercom on the wall cuts in.}
<C>__{intercom}
<D>__{dr. malahide, the new arrival is awake, and appears very distressed.}
<A>__{malahide steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves off. he nods at a nearby student.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{my part in this is over. you may tidy up for me. kyle, you come with me.}
<A>__{malahide and kyle leave the room.}
