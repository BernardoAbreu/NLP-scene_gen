<D>__{so, what's it to be? walk away and this cheque for sixteen thousand rupees is yours. look, it's even got your name on it.}
<A>__{he produces a cheque and waves it at jamal.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i don't have a bank account.}
<A>__{laughter from the audience. prem is momentarily wrong footed.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{but i will take cash.}
<A>__{more laughter, this time with jamal, rather than at him. prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically through his jacket pockets and trousers.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{nope. looks like the producer's stolen my wallet again }
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{ i will play.}
<A>__{nobody was expecting this. least of all prem who has to rearrange his features into one of surprised delight. he sits down.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{you'll play?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{well, well, well. we've got a wild one, here.}
<A>__{prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{for sixty four thousand rupees, ladies and gentlemen, the question once again....}
