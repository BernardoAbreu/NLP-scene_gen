<L>__{int doc's room night}
<A>__{later. doc sits up in bed, revived but looking like death warmed over, mouth gaping open, eyes swimming with every breath. dr. goodfellow stands by the bed, putting on his jacket.}
<C>__{dr. goodfellow}
<D>__{your condition is quite advanced. i'd say you've lost some 60 percent of your lung tissue. maybe more.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{so what does that mean?}
<C>__{dr. goodfellow}
<D>__{two years, two days, hard to say. if you have any chance, it's to stop now smoking, drinking, gambling, night life. you must have a healthy diet and most importantly, you must have complete rest meaning you must attempt to deny your marital impulse.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, that sounds inviting.}
<C>__{dr. goodfellow}
<D>__{sorry but i'm afraid you've no choice.}
<A>__{he takes his bag and exits, leaving doc alone with the abyss. kate enters, going to his bedside, and starts rolling him a cigarette.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how you feeling, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{better.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's good. i knew it wasn't nothin'.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we must talk, darling. it appears we have to... redefine the nature of our association.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what's that mean, doc? you know i don't understand when you talk up high like that. you mean you don't want to be my lovin' man no more?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{not exactly...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm a good woman to you, doc. don't i always take care of you? nobody cares for you like me. i'm a good woman.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yes, i know. you are a good woman.}
<A>__{kate smiles, licking the cigarette. she puts it in his mouth and leans over to light it so her ample bosom bulges over her bodice. as doc stares at her chest something behind his eyes seems to shut down. he takes a long drag from the cigarette.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{then again, you may be the antichrist.}
