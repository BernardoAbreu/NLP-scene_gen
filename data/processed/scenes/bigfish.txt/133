<A>__{filters through soft sheets. we're under the covers, where a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. a beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be}
<B>__{josephine.}
<A>__{she blinks slowly, just waking up. will is watching her. he's been up for a while. we are actually...}

<A>__{...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind of limbo. a kiss good morning. legs entangling. neither wants to get up.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i talked with your father last night.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{did you?}
<A>__{a look to say, should i be worried?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{you never told me how your parents met.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{they met at auburn.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{what about the details? how they fell in love. the circus. the war. you never told me any of that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's because most of it never happened.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{but it's romantic.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(non committal)}
<D>__{mmm.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{mmm, what?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{mmm, what. i know better than to argue romance with a french woman.}

<C>__{josephine}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{do you love him?}
<A>__{will doesn't want to answer yes or no.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you have to understand. when i was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. and i started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else. with another house, another family. he leaves us, he goes to them. or maybe there is no family. maybe he never wanted a family. but whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{but it's not true.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what is "true?" i've never heard my father say a single true thing.}
<A>__{off her silence...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{look, i know why you like him. i know why everyone likes him. but i need you to tell me i'm not crazy.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{you're not.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i need you on my side.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i am always on your side. and i think you should talk to him.}
