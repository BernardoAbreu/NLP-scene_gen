<D>__{is this what they call 'returning to the scene of the crime'?}
<A>__{unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they have to pass by... ... the plaza manager and the other house security agent, bruce (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling mrs. lo biancho. when morty and the cops come through the doors behind them, however, there's no choice. the girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:}
<C>__{plaza manager}
<D>__{i assure you, mr. and mrs. lo biancho, the plaza will do everything in its power to see that the emperor is safely returned and that the criminals are brought to justice.}
<C>__{mrs. lo biancho}
<D>__{justice?! i want them executed! tortured first, slowly, and then beheaded!}

<A>__{bruce looks over to morty like he's speaking slavic, but morty's furiously pointing and bruce sees... the girls break for the revolving doors. parker gets there first, plunges in so fast that a man entering is tossed headlong into the lobby. drew tries to time the quickly spinning door but one of the very high spiked heels catches, throwing her forward and sandwiching her in the revolving door.}

<A>__{outside parker sees drew caught in the door as bruce, morty and the cops close in. quickly, parker pushes the door back, releasing drew, who jumps in and swings out.}
