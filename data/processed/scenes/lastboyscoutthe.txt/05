<A>__{a deafening crunch as a defensive back hammers a wide receiver, nearly decapitates him. the ball rolls free. the back recovers it.}

<A>__{gets up off the bench. the rest of the offensive unit sprints onto the field. cole walks. straight ahead, eyes front. like a robot. his heartbeat thuds on the soundtrack.}
<C>__{color man }
<D>__{and so l.a. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... and you gotta be thinking, give the ball to billy cole. he has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense.}
<B>__{down on field}
<A>__{the huddle breaks. the l.a. team trudges through the snow to the line of scrimmage. cole adopts a three point stance. everything happens in hyper real slow motion: the snow falls. the receivers breeze past, in motion to begin their patterns. moving like gazelles. cole's fingers paw the cold earth. gouging it. he is like a spring. coiled and ready. the ball is snapped. turf and snow. erupting. a firecracker series of pops as linemen collide. legs churning. the ball floats through the snowy air. pitch out to cole. he takes it on the run. tucks it under his arm. behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled. cole turns the corner. picks up a blocker. feet pounding. arms pumping. up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him. low and hard. cole does not blink. he reaches beneath his jersey. pulls out a gun. pumps three shots into the free safety's head. the bullets go straight through. on the back of his helmet. a mixture of blood and fiberglass. cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone. around him, sound. fury. impact. confusion. another defensive back. straight ahead. reacts with almost comical terror. dives to one side. cole fires. blows out the guy's knee. ends a career. keeps going. we are now in full scale panic. the players are fleeing the field. shouts. pandemonium. a few brave men gather around the fallen players.}
<B>__{police}
<A>__{are on the field now. running full out. they've got riot guns, cocked and locked. sprinting through the snow. cole crosses the goal line. touchdown. drops the ball. turns, facing the cops. his eyes are insane. the crowd is screaming. people are running back and forth like extras in the keystone cops. the first two blasts from the cops' riot guns go high and wide. one shot blows apart the base of the goalpost. the forty foot high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. lands in a shower of snow and ice. cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him. he smiles and says:}
