<L>__{exterior st. charles bridge day}
<A>__{the beautiful and historic st. charles bridge spans the river. there are banners hanging in celebration of the coming prague peace conference. petra leads xander across it.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{we're getting out of this place. we've done enough.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{wait a minute, whoa. we can't go now. what's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{it doesn't matter anymore, forget it.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{of course it matters. hey, hold on!}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{what do we owe our governments? yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{no, now it's about us. let's do something for us before we both get killed. don't you want to get to bora bora, xander?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we can't leave now. we have to do something.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{why? you're the one who believes in nothing. screw the world, or whatever you said.}
<A>__{xander grabs her by shoulders.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{alright, so i was full of shit. i thought believing in things was wrong. turns out believing in nothing is worse. you might as well be dead. i'm not thrilled with the world, but i'm not gonna let those idiots start killing people. come on, you're a cop, we've got to get these guys.}
<A>__{he's gotten through to her. she nods in agreement.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{they left. to a fortress in the mountains.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we'll have to go after them.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{aren't you afraid?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. maybe that's my problem. if you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{i must be healthy, then, because i'm scared to death. i guess i'd better get back to yorgi.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you don't have to do that.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{yes, i do. you're right. i can't just let him go free. besides, i can help you from the inside.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?}
<C>__{petra}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. they'll believe me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{when this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. take a vacation.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{what the hell are we doing? we're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.}
<A>__{xander kisses her.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that gives us something to live for.}
<A>__{together they walk back across the bridge. we crane up, revealing the prague peace conference banners all over a big building on the river.}
