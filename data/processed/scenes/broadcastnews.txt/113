<A>__{as jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.}
<L>__{interior aaron's apartment hallway night}
<A>__{it is at the top of a flight of steps. she knocks on the door. rings. knocks. aaron opens it. he is wearing a sweatshirt and cords.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i was in the shower.}
<A>__{she enters.}
<L>__{interior aaron's apartment night}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how'd it go?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you didn't see it or speak to anybody?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{then it went well.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{did it really go well?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{define your terms.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do you feel good about it?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do others feel that you did well?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then what was good about it?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i lost six pounds...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{aaron, will you tell me?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{it was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. but i had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. oh, i lost one of your shoulder pads how was your evening anyway?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what do you mean, flop sweat? you're making too much out of it...i will bet you were the only one aware of it...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{people phoned in.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{stop kidding. i want to know what happened.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i'm not kidding.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{there were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no, nice ones worried that i was having a heart attack.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{if all that happened, how come you're so chipper?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i don't know. at a certain point it was so off the chart bad it got funny. my central nervous system was telling me something. jane sweat running down my face makeup falling into my eyes people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me all so i could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what i like to do anyway. and i'm chipper because you finally showed up. i thought i'd cook for us. tequila and eggs sound good?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have to be somewhere.}
<A>__{he looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i told what's his name tom that i'd meet him.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{call him i mean it can wait, right?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(now the plunge)}
<D>__{i don't know. i may be in love with him.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(as if he just burned his hand)}
<D>__{no!!!!!}
<A>__{she starts for the door.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{don't go.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{this is important to me.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{yeah. well...i think it is important for you too. sit down.}
<A>__{she sits. he walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... silence.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(looking at her)}
<D>__{let me think a second. it's tough.}
<A>__{a remarkably long silence her mind wanders, she takes stock... it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching into himself.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{aaach...jane...}
<P>__{(glancing at note)}
<D>__{let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. you know?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(testy and wary but fair)}
<D>__{yes, i guess. yes.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you can't end up with tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah being a basket case.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i know you care about him. i've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when i tell you that i believe that tom, while a very nice guy, is the devil.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{this isn't friendship.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{what do you think the devil is going to look like if he's around? nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. no. i'm semi serious here. he will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great god fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. just coax along flash over substance... just a tiny bit. and he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.}
<P>__{(seeing he's not reaching her)}
<D>__{and he'll get all the great women.}
<A>__{she is getting pissed.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i think you're the devil.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no. you know that i'm not.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{because we have the kind of relationship where if i were the devil, you'd be the only one i told.}
<A>__{she's briefly impressed. he has a pointerior}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you were quick enough to get tom's help when...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{yes, yes. i know. right. and if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe i'd be keeping quiet about all this...i grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...and i'm in love with you.}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{how do you like that? i buried the lead.}
<A>__{he pauses to catch his breath breathing deeply through his nose.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(an aside)}
<D>__{i've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(thawing)}
<D>__{sit down, stop.}
<A>__{aaron slumps down it's been a long round.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i've never fought for anyone before. does anybody win one of these things?}
