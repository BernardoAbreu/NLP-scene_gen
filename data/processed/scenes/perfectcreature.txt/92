<L>__{int: jamestown slum, hideout sunset}
<A>__{we are in a large, derelict warehouse; detritus and stacked and smashed wooden crates. music is playing somewhere in the distance from a phonograph. we track through the space. daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high above, creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from the dust. we pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high walled maze. music emits from a stereo, loud. we continue to move down a hall. through the detritus, towards a door. a hand opens the door.}
