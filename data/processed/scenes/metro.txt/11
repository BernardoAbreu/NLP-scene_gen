<C>__{roper}
<D>__{that was fine, earl. now i'm going to get your car.}
<A>__{roper turns around and walks toward the front door. he stops and looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{oh, there's one last thing.}
<A>__{earl looks like he's right on the edge.}

<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{in one swift motion, roper turns, aims and fires!... one shot. it tears into earl's shoulder. one inch from debbie's neck. earl is blown back against the counter. debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs. swat guys pour in from every entrance. yelling for everybody to "get down"! pointing guns. they pounce on earl.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i give up! i give up!}
<A>__{roper goes to debbie, puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank.}
