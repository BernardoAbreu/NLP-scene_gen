<A>__{tj walks around the back of the house. he tries the handle to the back door. it's locked. tj sees the dog door. he climbs through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. the tv is loud inside.}
<L>__{interior dustin's house continuous}
<A>__{tj treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears poised. he walks through to the living area. he steps behind the couch out of dustin's line of sight. dustin's bare feet hang off the end of the couch. tj ducks down. he opens the shears and carefully brings them down over dustin's big toe. he squeezes them shut... dustin squeals.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{where's my car?}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{what are you doing!?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{where's my fucking car?}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{are you crazy?!}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{you make me ask one more time, your toe's coming off. i swear to god.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{it's gone to the wrecker's.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{the wrecking yard.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<A>__{tj squeezes a little harder. dustin squeals a little louder.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{why would i be lying?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{because you're a fucking asshole. tell me where it is.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{it's gone to the wrecker's. i swear to god.}
<A>__{tj squeezes harder. dustin squeals.}
<C>__{dustin }
<D>__{i'm not lying. it went to the wrecking yard on sunrise near red bridge, yesterday afternoon. it's there now.}
<A>__{tj thinks, holding dustin's toe in his grip.}
<C>__{dustin }
<D>__{i swear to god, man. it's at the wrecking yard on sunrise.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{if you're lying, i'm gonna cut off every one of your fingers.}
<A>__{tj doesn't quite know what to do now. he stares at dustin who looks genuinely frightened. tj releases the shears and backs away. and the second he does so, dustin leaps off the couch, grabs tj by the throat and slams him down on the living room floor. tj drops the shears.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{you finished? want to tell me something else while you're visiting?}
<A>__{dustin wails into tj. tj cowers on the ground. punches land}
<D>__{until }
<A>__{a lawn chair comes crashing through the front window into the living room, raining glass everywhere. dustin stops punching, stunned, and looks up to see hesher, dripping wet, step through the big nasty hole he has just made.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<A>__{dustin moves to stand. hesher pounces on him, dragging him along the ground. he grabs the shears and brings them straight up to dustin's nose. in the same movement, he snaps the shears shut and takes the end of dustin's nose off. dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his face, blood leaking between his fingers. tj stands, stunned.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{oh my god, my nose!}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{i just saved you.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{you cut his nose off.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{only a bit, it's just a cut.}
<A>__{dustin is crying now, clutching his face. tj goes to the kitchen.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{you just cut his nose off!}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{tj runs a rag under the tap and takes it to dustin. hesher stands, clutching the shears, confused.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{hold this against your face.}
<A>__{dustin moans. hesher is still confused.}
<C>__{tj }
<D>__{you gotta stop the bleeding.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<A>__{dustin holds the rag. tj stands to face hesher.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i want you outta my life. i'm serious. i never want to see you again. how many times do i have say it?}
<A>__{they look at each other a moment. hesher looks taken aback. he honestly believed he was doing a good thing. tj leaves, through the front door. hesher stands over a whimpering dustin wondering what went wrong.}
