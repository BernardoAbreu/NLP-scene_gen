<L>__{exterior st. mere cathedral dusk}
<A>__{miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins of a medieval church. miller, settled into a comfortable spot in the debris, eating his k rations, looks very relaxed. reiben paces.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sure, what do you want to know?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? what's the sense in risking six guys to save one?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ours is not to reason why.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'd much rather die in caen than ramelle, sir. it's a personal thing.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{easy for you to say, sir.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fucking james ryan, i'd like to wring his fucking neck.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{jesus, reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{hey, i got a mother. jackson, you got a mother?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{last i knew.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{wade, sarge, corporal insect, all of us, hell, i will bet even the captain has a mother.}
<A>__{miller smiles. reiben eyes him and reconsiders.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us have mothers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you have orders, too.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{sir, i have an opinion on this matter.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'd love to hear it.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{seems to me, cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. miller go on.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{well, sir, by my way a thinkin' i am a finely made instrument of warfare. what i mean by that is, if you was to put me with this here sniper rifle anywhere up to and includin' one mile from adolf hitler, with a clear line of sight, war's over.}
<A>__{miller nods.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, i want you to listen closely to jackson. this is the way to gripe. jackson, continue.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yes, sir. it seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack dab in the middle of berlin, germany. now i ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my god given talent.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{wade?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{hell, i don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at ramelle for...}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(finishing wade's sentence)}
<D>__{...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{upham?}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{pass.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sarge?}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{i'm just here to keep a bunch of numb nuts, including one certain, frequently suicidal, tempter of fate, from getting themselves killed.}
<A>__{reiben eyes miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{and what about you, captain?}
<A>__{miller looks at reiben, shocked.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, what's the matter with you? i don't gripe to you. i'm a captain. there's a chain of command. griping goes one way, up, only up, never down. you gripe to me, i gripe to my superior officers. up, get it? i don't gripe to you, i don't gripe in front of you. how long you been in the army?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, i apologize.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but if you weren't a captain, or if i were a major, what would you say?}
<A>__{miller considers his response.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{in that case, i would say this is an excellent mission, with an extremely valuable objective, worthy of my best efforts.}
<A>__{reiben rolls his eyes. miller plays it straight, with no obvious sarcasm.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{in addition, as i pointed out earlier, i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to help relieve her suffering. the men thoroughly enjoy the performance.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{sir, if you were not a captain, i would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but i am a captain. if i were not a captain, i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top notch poker player, which i am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...}
<A>__{the men all learn forward expectantly, believing they're about to find out miller's home town. miller smiles.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...my home town, which shall remain un named.}
<A>__{the men ease back, disappointed.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{any further thoughts on the subject?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{yes, sir, as a final note, i'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of france and while we're at it, fuck private james ryan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i will make a note of your suggestions but i will leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.}
<A>__{the men wince and laugh. miller checks his watch and gets serious.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we move out in two hours, try and get some sleep.}
<A>__{the men know when to can it. without another word, they all settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to follow miller's order. upham looks around at these strange men, then, a simple, hard glare from miller makes him follow suit. miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his flashlight. he turns it on, in the dim glow of the light, he studies his maps while his men rest.}
