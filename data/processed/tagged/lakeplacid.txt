<D>__{alright, ms. paleontologist. i wanna know why that monster is here. you got a theory?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why he's that big, i don't know. why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving. australia, fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but why maine and why alone? crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?}
<C>__{hector}

<D>__{let's get ready.}
<A>__{hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore. behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc. back on the shore, keough's men ready themselves for action. tranq guns. rifles... the team is mobilized. we hear a distressed cry from the cow.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he's mooing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you wouldn't?}

<D>__{they're coming right in.}
<C>__{kelly}

<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{you set?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{don't worry about me.}
<A>__{incredibly... the plan is working. a giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline. hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore. the big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak. the time is now.}

<C>__{hector}

<L>__{exterior beach continuous}
<C>__{jack}

<A>__{the crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping at air. hector pulls up with the chopper.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{fire!!}
<A>__{jack, gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts. but hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to swing like a pendulum. it rocks the chopper.}

<D>__{motherfucker.}
<L>__{exterior beach continuous}
<A>__{suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping off the cable.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{and down comes to the chopper, hector cannot control it. it crashes into the lake.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hector!!}

<P>__{(to keough)}

<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i will take it!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hector. do not move.}
<A>__{the water is calm again. a beat.}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(to gare)}
<D>__{you see anything?}
<C>__{gare}
<P>__{(looking through binocs)}
<D>__{nothing. maybe he swam out.}
<A>__{upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging the truck. screams.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go!! drive!!}
<A>__{the pick up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing keough off balance. the croc heads back for the water as keough regains his balance.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{take him!!}
<A>__{and keough blasts. it detonates the ground near the croc causing him to surge airborne into the water. and he goes under. silence. a beat.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{did you get him?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(to the driver)}
<D>__{back the truck }
<C>__{all}
<D>__{no!!!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hector, you see anything?}
<B>__{angle hector}
<A>__{on the pontoon of his chopper. he's looking about, studying the water.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{i just have this feeling everything's totally safe.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i see blood. maybe you got him, hank.}
<A>__{and as hector looks further. behind him... up surfaces the crocodile in all his stealth. his head is two feet from hector and nobody knows it. least of all hector.}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{i can't see him, but this is definitely blood. maybe you got him.}
<A>__{and as he turns back, he sees it. the croc comes up as hector screams, jumps off. screams. keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give hector some cover. hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper. he climbs in.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{where is he?!}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<A>__{no sooner said than the croc comes launching up. as he springs toward the open chopper cabin, hector, leaps out on the other side. the croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin and he becomes wedged. the crocodile is stuck, he protrudes right through the chopper. he's not completely immobilized but wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{hector!!}
<A>__{but now jack has joined, rifle in hand. hector surfaces again, swimming for shore. jack runs to help him onto land.}
<C>__{keough }
<P>__{(taking aim)}
<D>__{alright. game over.}
<A>__{but the croc looks feeble now. he lets out this moan of death. and even keough hesitates to pull the trigger.}
<C>__{keough }
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{should i?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{wait.}
<B>__{resume}
<A>__{the croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach. but there's no rage in his behavior now. he seems desperate. he's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i think the drugs are kicking in.}
<A>__{breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage. as unbelievable as that cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even more astonishing, if not preposterous, now. a thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter. and he just cannot go on anymore. kelly, hector, jack, keough, stare back. they approach with caution. they all stare at the tired crocodile.}
<B>__{angle the croc}
<A>__{he's now looking back. bleeding, gasping... beaten. in his eyes... we can see it. the beast is beaten.}
<B>__{angle the principles}
<A>__{there's no triumph. in their eyes... sadness.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath.}
<A>__{it continues to breathe heavily.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he's through fighting. look at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't care. hank. end it.}
<A>__{keough raises his cannon.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no. look. he's got nothing left.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah and every time we think there's no more danger }
<A>__{upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the water, seizing hector. screams. it death rolls hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more. keough blasts his avenger. a direct hit. it takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing into the air. it splashes down, the first head not to hit kelly. they all then go for hector, pulling him to shore. he's bleeding.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're not okay, your leg's a mess.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get him onto shore.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he heeds a tourniquet.}
<A>__{keough quickly peels off his shirt. gives it to kelly, who goes to work.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{you're gonna be okay.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{guess i finally got bit.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah, you got bit. i'm gonna fix it.}
<A>__{a sudden roar. kelly screams as jack and keough wheel to see... the big croc. maybe his final roar, he looks weak. gasping in the crashed chopper. jack and keough approach.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(quietly; re the big croc)}
<D>__{he's done. he's dying.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't count on it.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{we better take him out.}
<A>__{but something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at them... nobody wants wants to take him out.}
<B>__{angle the croc}
<A>__{looking back at them. he knows he's in their hands now. he knows.}
<B>__{angle the humans}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{flax him under his tail. two hundred cc's. under the tail, that'll put him to sleep.}
<A>__{upon which we hear the sound of trucks. florida fish and game, u.s. wildlife, arriving on the scene.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{officer colson, florida fish and game, emerges, approaches. stares with utter disbelief.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{we need to get it some medical help.}
<P>__{(re hector)}
<D>__{and him too.}
<A>__{by now the florida army has moved in. they all stare with the same suspended disbelief.}

<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i guess.}
