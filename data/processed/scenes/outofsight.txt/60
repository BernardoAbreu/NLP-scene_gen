<L>__{interior marshall's condo day}
<A>__{as karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up, opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty two pistol, and some of his clothes.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{so the woman's married. she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. but you don't reveal her name, you protect her. it sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{dad.}
<A>__{he looks over at her now. gives her an innocent look.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{what?}
