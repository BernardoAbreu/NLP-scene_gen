<A>__{pi leans down to the font beside the door and drinks. he's about to leave again when he notices the stations of the cross depicted on plaques that encircle the church.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you must be thirsty. here, i brought you this.}
<A>__{not knowing what else to do, pi takes the glass and drinks. an awkward pause as he searches for something anything to say. he finally points up to one of the paintings.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{why would a god do that? why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?}
<A>__{the priest smiles down upon pi.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{because he loves us. god made himself approachable to us human so we could understand him.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{we can't understand god in all his perfection, but we can understand god's son and his suffering as we would a brother's.}
