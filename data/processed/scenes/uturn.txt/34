<L>__{exterior highway car day}
<A>__{in a rented convertible, we now see sergei racing across the desert. his jacket off, a man with a mission. he glances at his watch, eager to get to this "fucking hole in the wall" which is somewhere on this incomprehensible american map he holds in one hand.}
<L>__{interior jake's realty office day}
<A>__{bobby squats, looking at a real estate model of a desert development. jake smiles.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what can i do for you, lad?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i was hoping we could talk.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{talk? about what?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{about things. about your wife.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sweet grace? what about her?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{about what you said this morning.}
<A>__{jake shakes his head as if he doesn't understand.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. fifty thousand dollars.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i did?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{don't play simple with me, jake. you're a betting man. you want me to spell it out for you? i will kill grace if you cut me in on the money.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{boy i think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm not rambling.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're talking like a madman.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well then, i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. you're the one brought it up. this morning. in your car.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh, that was just loose talk. husband gettin' pissed off. i don't want anybody dead.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{bullshit. you wanted me to kill her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{a man doesn't always mean the things he says.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you meant it.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and what does that make you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{the slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... (pause) you're a jealous man jake. if you can't have grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.}
<A>__{for a moment jake stares quietly at bobby.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{well, i guess i have what you call a love hate relationship with grace.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you love her, but you hate her?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, i hate loving her. i hate the kind of person she is. i hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. the bitch. she loved to play. she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it. she tortures me. but she's family. she's my little girl. my baby. i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. no. not me. but you? you got the killing in you, boy...how much you want?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{make it twenty.}
<P>__{jake (stressed, paces)}
<D>__{twenty thousand? i don't have that kind of money. i won't get the insurance until months after she's dead. i don't imagine you'll want to be stickin' around after poor grace's demise. twenty thousand; that's more money than i could ever get my hands on.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how much could you get?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{maybe ... ten thousand. and that's a maybe.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i need thirteen.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's a bit much.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're not talking about buying a car jake. we're talking about killing your wife. it's thirteen, or it's nothing.}
<A>__{for a moment the two men stand silent. all we hear is the ticking of a grandfather clock that stands in the corner.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm not your boy. i don't like you. i got no choice but to do business with you. let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{don't say that. i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead... well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{do we shake hands?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? the thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. if it doesn't, then it's no good. i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how do you want it?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how the hell should i know? i've never had a wife killed before. jesus christ! you want this job, you don't know how to do this? i guess i should have hired a professional.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you want to do this yourself? i don't have to do this, you know.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{be quiet, boy. i got to figure this thing. i'm thinking. it can't be done at the house. it should be...}
<A>__{jake walks the office thinking.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh yeah sure. why don't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i'm at it. i know you ...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{this is what you do: go to the house to see her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and tell her what?}
