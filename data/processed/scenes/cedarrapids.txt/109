<L>__{interior uncle ken's pick up truck night}
<A>__{boston's more than a feeling blares on the radio of a pick up truck. tim politely rocks out, sandwiched between bree and gary in the front seat. a violent looking, wire thin man in an applebee's uniform, uncle ken, 40, drives. after a bit:}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{that must be pretty all right, ken, getting half off at applebee's all the time. i'd only weigh like 10 thousand pounds...}
<C>__{uncle ken}
<D>__{pass me that cube, skeet.}
<A>__{gary opens the glove box, passes ken a glass pipe. ken lights up, takes a hit, passes it to bree. bree follows suit, then passes the pipe to tim. tim looks at it, pauses.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ah...? this would be marijuana, i'm guessing?}
<A>__{a beat. then they all laugh like crazy. so tim laughs, too. bree puts the pipe in tim's mouth. he looks frightened.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{suck the glass dick, dude.}
<A>__{they laugh. bree lights the pipe. tim inhales and instantly: oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! tim's eyes bulge, his teeth grind. then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently coughs.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{a butterscotch might help.}
