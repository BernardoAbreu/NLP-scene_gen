<L>__{interior smaller ice cave day}
<A>__{the refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air when dr. bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder. it is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the fireman acting as an incubator host for some kind of organism growing inside him. bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the plastic drapery to enter. angle inside, plastic lined area where the body of the fireman is still inside the quarantine bubble litter in f.g. bronschweig takes out of his pocket a syringe and an ampule. turning now to the body. stepping to it. moving a work light, as he had done for the cigarette smoking man, so that it shines on the face of the fireman. but when he does this, bronschweig nearly jumps, his breath stolen away. reacting to: angle on fireman's body the chest and torso have imploded. it has been turned into a muddy mass of blood stained jelly; bone and tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due to the fact that the creature which was inside is now gone. camera whips from bronschweig to the wall. to the temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees celsius. whipping back to bronschweig who is now panicked.}
