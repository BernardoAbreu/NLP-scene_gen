<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{there are no autonomic effects, just the paralysis of the lower extremities.}
<A>__{candy stares at him, uncomprehending.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{wally can have kids, a normal sex life...}
<A>__{candy cries.}

<A>__{ray is throwing snails in the water. candy sits on the end of the dock, slumped on homer's shoulder.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{how about him not needin' the friggin' compass! how about that?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{daddy, please...}
<A>__{ray knows that she wants him to leave. he shuffles off the dock, toward the house. he knows how they both must feel.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{good night, kids. don't catch cold it's gettin' cold already.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{good night, daddy.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{good night, ray.}
<A>__{homer tries to cuddle closer, but candy sits up, preoccupied.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{just tell me. i will do whatever you want to do.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{isn't that like waiting and seeing?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{no. nothing is nothing. i want wally to come home. i'm afraid to see him, too.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(he kisses her)}
<D>__{is that nothing.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{no, don't that's something. nothing is nothing.}
<P>__{(homer's sad smile)}
<D>__{don't even look at me. i want...}
<A>__{candy buries her face in his chest.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{...to do nothing.}
<A>__{homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. as her crying subsides, homer's thoughts are far away. with candy slumped against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead, he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, candy's words resonating. an unfamiliar expression is on his face.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself)}
<D>__{it's a tempting idea, i know... to do nothing.}
<A>__{candy is silent. homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts his position.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(groans)}
<D>__{please don't move, don't go anywhere.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(overly genuine)}
<D>__{go anywhere? of course not! that would be doing something, wouldn't it? we wouldn't want to do something. let's just sit here all night!}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{if you're trying to be funny, homer...}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(irritated, too)}
<D>__{i'm not trying to be anything i'm just doing nothing! if i wait and see long enough, then with any luck i won't ever have to make up my mind! decisions can be painful, after all...}
<A>__{candy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{stop it! just cut it out!}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(mock surprise)}
<D>__{you got up! you did something! if you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a decision!}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{for god's sake, homer, wally's been shot down!}
<A>__{candy sobs. homer puts his face in his hands for a minute. he regains his composure and stands up.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(genuinely contrite)}
<D>__{i know, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(yelling and sobbing)}
<D>__{he's paralyzed!}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(deadpan; just the facts)}
<D>__{he's alive. he still loves you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so do i.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<A>__{he faces away from her.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(with calm resolve)}
<D>__{nothing. you're not the one who has to do anything.}
