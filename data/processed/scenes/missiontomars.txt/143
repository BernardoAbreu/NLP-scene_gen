<A>__{mcconnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the hab airlock. luke, terri and phil are coming out behind him. the wind has picked up, and fine dust is blowing. they stop, staring off in astonishment towards}
<B>__{a frightening sight}
<A>__{the entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into purplish black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. the dust storm has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers away and closing. the main body of it reaches two thousand meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand kilometer front.}
<B>__{the astronauts}
<A>__{stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. mcconnell turns to luke, whose expression is grim.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{how long before it hits?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{an hour? maybe less.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{how bad?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{a storm like that? it could go planetary. and last a year.}
<A>__{mcconnell stares at him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it'll sock us in, jim. we won't be able to take off. if that happens, with what few supplies we've got left...? we'll starve to death.}
<A>__{mcconnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. the others look at him with questioning gazes. he turns again. there's the four man rover, ready to go. waiting.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{phil, how much longer to prep the erv?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{maybe forty five minutes. it'll be tight, but we can make it.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{then there's still time for us to get out there and back.}
<A>__{he looks a question at luke and terri, one after the other. their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{stay here. continue the repair. if something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{go back... alone?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{if we're not back in forty five minutes, i want you to prep and launch.}
<P>__{(looks at his armpad display)}
<D>__{that's 1950 hours.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{jim }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{it's not a suggestion, it's an order. you understand?}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{i understand. but }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{you understand what?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{if you're not back by 1950, i prep and launch.}
<A>__{mcconnell nods, satisfied. looks at terri and luke.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{they start towards the four man rover. dust is swirling more thickly through the air, and the wind is louder now. phil stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.}
