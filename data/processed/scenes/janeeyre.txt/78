<L>__{interior evening. morton the school room.}
<A>__{jane is tidying up at the end of the day. the classroom is empty. her life is bare. it shows on her face. she looks up. st john rivers is watching her from the door.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{do you find the work too hard?}
<A>__{jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and continues clearing up.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not at all. i'm getting on very well.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{do you feel the solitude an oppression?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i hardly have time to notice it.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{then perhaps your accommodations have disappointed you. they are in truth scanty enough }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a few months ago i had nothing. i was wretched. now i have a home and work; free and honest. i wonder at the goodness of god and at the generosity of my friends.}
<A>__{st john approaches her; speaks intimately.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{what you had left before i met you, i don't know. but i counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it's what i mean to do.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{we can overcome every kind of human weakness. a year ago i was myself intensely miserable. i considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed or i would die. after a season of darkness and struggling, light broke. i heard my call from god. put your trust in him, jane. let him lead you to your future.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{st john is turning to go.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{why were you intensely miserable?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{a year ago, i was weak enough to fall in love.}
<A>__{jane moves involuntarily towards him.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{don't pity me; i have no compassion whatsoever for you. i regarded this love as a fever of the flesh; not a thing that would ever touch my soul. i scorned the weakness, fought hard against it and won.}
<A>__{jane is incredulous. st john is at her desk. it is covered in her drawings. he glances through them.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{i could have listened to temptation, sunk down in the silken snare and known a feverish and delusive bliss. i could have squandered my future upon it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you could have been happy.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{a slave in a fool's paradise? i'd rather my life had purpose }
<A>__{st john suddenly snatches up a piece of paper.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{is this yours?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{his eyes, in an instant, seem to take in everything about her. he opens his mouth to speak then checks himself.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{nothing in the world.}
<A>__{he folds the paper and takes it.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he goes. jane looks after him, puzzled.}
