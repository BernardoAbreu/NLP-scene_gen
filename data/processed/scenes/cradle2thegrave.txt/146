<C>__{ling}
<D>__{you're the world's foremost arms dealers. you all know that weaponry equals power. and in the world of weaponry, nukes rule.}
<C>__{ling }
<D>__{but nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle... but what if it weren't?... that's the question that brought you here tonight... and here's the answer.}
<A>__{ling holds up a single stone.}
<C>__{ling}
<D>__{in its present state, it's completely inert. zero radiation, zero volatility...}
<A>__{whereupon ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table. folds the velvet over. then, whack, hits it hard with a mallet. he unfolds the velvet. the stone's smashed to pieces. ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to russell, who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then inserts the capsule into his contraption.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{goggles on.}
<A>__{everyone puts on goggles. then russell hits the switch, and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone, which begins to glow. russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale }
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{... firecracker... .44 magnum... r.p.g... sidewinder... scud... tomahawk... daisy cutter... hiroshima... two hiroshimas...}
<A>__{and it just keeps going. until, finally }
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{... new world order.}
<A>__{as the buyers absorb this... russell shuts off the beams.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{goggles off.}
<A>__{russell removes the capsule and hands it back to ling, who holds it up.}
<C>__{ling}
<D>__{one small fragment. transformed into a source of immense energy. more powerful than weapons grade plutonium a hundred times its size.}
<A>__{a beat as this sinks in.}
<C>__{sona}
<D>__{the purpose of today's sale is to begin trading a new commodity on the black market and establish its value... there are fifty stones available in the first sale. the opening price is one million per stone... bids, please?}
<A>__{the buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. at the same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators. ling looks on as sona runs the sale, and russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market analysis for sona to consult. the pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation.}
<C>__{russian buyer}
<D>__{five at one million.}
<A>__{sona is silent. silence means "no."}
<C>__{african buyer}
<D>__{five at one point two.}
