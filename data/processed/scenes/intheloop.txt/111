<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{was what me?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{was it fucking you!? answer the question!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she can't very well answer the question if you don't tell her what it is, can she?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{fuck off to your room, count of cunty cristo, this is between me and her.}
<P>__{(to suzy)}
<D>__{you leaked liza weld's paper to the bbc. tell me you leaked it.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i didn't leak anything. i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{you're lying. you touched your nose. that's what's called a `tell'. you are lying.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{no i'm not.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{`no i'm not.' that's a tell as well. classic.}
<P>__{(changing tack to terror)}
<D>__{i know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here.}
<A>__{he pushes a fax casually off the table onto the floor.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{this is what i'm doing to the machine.}
<P>__{(he kicks it, hard till bits}
<D>__{start to break off, but he's still quite controlled}
<P>__{talking, as he kicks more)}
<D>__{you see? this is how angry i am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry i am with the person who did it? yeah? can you suzy?}
<A>__{he kicks the fax machine again.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it was me.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{oh fuck off. don't come over all spartacus now.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i leaked it.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{advances on michael, becomes aware of the music. jamie points to the cd player.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{okay for a start turn that fucking row off. it's just fucking vowels. listen to it. just subsidised fucking foreign vowels. you only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says "i went to private school".}
<A>__{michael doesn't turn it off, so jamie does.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{who did you leak it to?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i just sent it. i thought it was important so i sent it through.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(considers then, )}
<D>__{ok. see this fax machine?(kick) that's your career. i'm pretty sure it's fucked. let me just check (kick). yeah, it is. plus, breach of official secrets, so that's fucking swannee. maybe you can get a part time job in west end as a gentleman's fluffer. or whatever the fuck they call it these days.}
<A>__{jamie is heading off.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, you know better to go out with a bang...}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{no, no. i will not allow this to be a bang. this will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy fucking machine. and they do exist, `cos my gran's got one.}
<A>__{jamie leaves.}
