<A>__{from parker's pov, the camera slowly reveals what is just beyond the bloody tree... but the look on parker's face tells us everything we need to know first. there, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree, is the pack of wolves. some still feeding. others resting attentively. they are circled around lynch's bloody, half eaten remains. quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all flash before parker's devastated eyes. she slows herself to a complete stop now. not knowing what to do. one of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see parker just a few feet away. it is the pack leader. lynch's blood pools from it's jaws. it's ears go back and it growls loudly at parker. she makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. parker and the pack leader lock eyes. finally, the leader turns away from parker, back to his food. back to his family. though her face is emotionless, parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side. she is free.}
