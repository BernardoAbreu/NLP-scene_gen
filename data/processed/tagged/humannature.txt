<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{bird's eye view. we circle lazily above the forest. through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground. as the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body.}

<D>__{i'm not sorry.}

<D>__{i am sorry.}

<D>__{i don't even know what sorry means anymore.}
<A>__{as nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out of frame forehead. another blinding flash of light.}

<L>__{exterior police station night}
<A>__{it's a frenetic hand held shot as lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house. cameras flash. reporters shout questions. lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior police station night}
<A>__{a ratty interrogation room. institutional green walls. beat up file cabinets. dark. a bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. a reel to reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. she is smoking. three fat, mean looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. one of the cops eyes her lasciviously. lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i'm not sorry. so i spend the rest of my life in jail. so what? i've been in jail my whole life anyway. a jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones...}
<A>__{one of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. it's going to be a long night.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{...a jail called the human body.}
<A>__{the lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at lila's reference to "human body."}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{my soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench ridden bag of bones and entrails. a bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun damaged back...}
<A>__{the lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{at least now i will be able to blame the state, not god, for my incarceration.}

<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. the auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. puff sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. he pours himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then speaks: stentorian, confident.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{i am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us. your's is a complicated, sad world.}
<A>__{this is a revelation to the assembled crowd. people whisper to each other.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{and i never knew that. i was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when i was ripped out of my eden and immersed in this harshness. some would argue that the life i was living was not a human life at all. and, gentlemen, i don't have any clever retort. i am not a philosopher. the only thing i know is that i am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from eden, sorry for my lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for nathan... rotting in his grave.}

<A>__{nathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white table. everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in nathan's temple.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i don't even know what sorry means anymore. it's odd. when i was alive i knew maybe it was all i knew but here sorry is meaningless. love is meaningless. jealousy is meaningless. ambition is meaningless. everything that motivated my every breath while i was alive is meaningless now.}

<D>__{i guess that's how i can be sure i'm really dead.}

<L>__{exterior suburban street day}
<A>__{it's got that faded, "memory" look. twelve year old lila hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest. other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing and chatting. lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face.}

<L>__{70's based on the preponderance of bay city rollers posters}
<A>__{on the wall. twelve year old lila enters the room, closes the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked. she draws the shades. she pulls some t shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor.}
<C>__{kid brother }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hey, no fair!}
<C>__{twelve year old lila}

<C>__{adult lila }
<D>__{something terrible started to happen to my body when i was twelve. my mother said because of it i would never be able to get a man, so i should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion... or whatever.}
<A>__{lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. she pulls it open. she is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds. on the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below it, is hair. dark curly hair. she stares at it, touches it cautiously. then she starts to cry. she crouches into a ball and weeps.}
<C>__{adult lila }
<D>__{the doctor said...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior doctor's office day}

<P>__{(to the mother)}

<C>__{puff}
<D>__{i don't think there's anyone in the world who doesn't know by now that i was raised in the wilderness by an ape. well, to be fair, by a man who thought himself an ape, but it amounts to the same thing gentlemen, does it not?}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior forest clearing day.}
<A>__{this has a faded, "memory" look also. a naked, bearded, dirty middle aged man and a naked, dirty ten year old puff walk along like apes, crouched over and dragging their knuckles.}

<T>__{cut to:}

<D>__{he had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of "apprentice ape."}
<A>__{puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops, goes back and examines the headline. it reads: president kennedy assassinated. puff's father looks heavenward and clutches at his temples in despair.}
<C>__{puff }

<A>__{puff testifies.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{it might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes. in retrospect, however, i'd say that i was a pygmy chimp.}

<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i have to say i always hated apes. of course i don't any longer. i don't even know what hate means now. but while alive, i hated apes. i blame my parents. i mean, i don't blame them. i don't know what blame is, really, anymore, but i think they influenced me in my ape hating tendencies.}

<L>__{exterior zoo day}
<A>__{faded colors. ten year old nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted suit walks along with his uptight, british parents. they arrive at the ape pen. nathan is excited. he jumps up and down. the apes jump up and down also.}

<D>__{monkeys! look, mama, monkeys!}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(clamping down on his shoulder)}

<C>__{puff's father}
<D>__{i am not a human being! i am an animal!}
<A>__{nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on curiously, a little frightened. nathan's mother chooses to ignore it.}

<C>__{father}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{uh...}
<P>__{(then by rote)}

<C>__{nathan as a boy}
<D>__{no, papa. what?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{culture. civilization. refinement. if we do not have these as humans, then we might as well be living in pens and throwing our feces about, masturbating in public...}

<P>__{(laughs derisively)}
<D>__{but what self loathing i felt! who would have someone as repulsive, as unladylike as me? i did everything i could to shield the world from this repulsiveness.}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it's embarrassing, okay?}
<C>__{female roommate}
<D>__{it's not so bad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, it just keeps growing?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yeah, natalie. it's hair. it grows.}
<C>__{female roommate}
<D>__{well, don't jump down my throat. i'm just trying to help.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{how is that helping, natalie? how exactly?}
<C>__{female roommate}
<D>__{look, if you're going to be like that... you should be appreciative that i'm interested.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{why, because i'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?}
<C>__{female roommate}
<P>__{(pegged)}
<D>__{you're fucked up, lila.}
<P>__{(out the door)}
<D>__{why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? figure it out for chrissake.}

<L>__{interior art museum day}
<A>__{twelve year old lila walks sadly through an art museum. she looks at various old portraits of men. she studies their facial hair. when she turns a corner, she is shocked to see a large renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur. she hurries to it. she looks at the placard next to the painting. it is a painting of mary magdalene.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{i remember once coming across a painting of mary magdalene entirely covered with fur. i guess that's where i got the idea that maybe the catholic church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women.}
<L>__{interior convent day}
<A>__{lila, in a nun's habit, is on her knees praying.}
<C>__{lila }

<L>__{exterior city street night}
<A>__{lila walks home. she's wrapped in winter clothing, but we can still see a bit of her white beard. it's snowing. the street is deserted. she spots a lighted window, she peers in. it's a warm family scene. large group of chatting, laughing people. fire in the fireplace. big turkey on the table.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{they say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people.}

<C>__{lila }
<D>__{i decided there was something poetic about killing myself with a razor blade.}
<A>__{on the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her intently. at first she is startled, but then she and the creature seem to be communing. his little black beady eyes reflect the light. lila starts to cry. she puts down the blade.}

<C>__{lila}

<A>__{we see a tent in a clearing. a smoking campfire. there is a rustling inside the tent. lila steps out naked. she is covered with fur. she pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable in her skin, watching the world around her. squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her. she smiles.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn't seem to judge my hair. i felt at peace when there were no humans around. i figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around. i became a nature writer.}

<A>__{there is a violent, violent storm. the hair drier drone has turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets and wind howling at fifty miles an hour. branches crack. lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. it turned the sky a queer shade of green. a green that said "watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell." i could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. part of the nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it.}
<A>__{lightning hits a tree nearby. it falls with a smack practically on top of lila. she screams, then defiantly stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. the wind and rain whip her hair around her head. she laughs with amazing gusto and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon.}

<C>__{rose}
<D>__{my brother says the guy's a thirty five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.}

<D>__{you did create me in your image, nathan. before you i was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. after you i became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. in a word, nathan, i became you. lila has reintroduced me to myself. and, incidentally, what i'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth. before when i killed, it was for food or in self defense. now i will kill for revenge. revenge is an abstract concept, nathan. and i learned abstract thinking from you.}
