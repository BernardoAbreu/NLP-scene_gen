<L>__{interior hospital examination room later}
<A>__{edith, art and adam sit in the exam room, each reading their respective magazines minus art who is lost somewhere in his own world. the tension is thick. edith looks at her watch and shivers. there's a knock at the door. a cute nurse enters.}
<C>__{cute nurse}
<D>__{the doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. you guys holding up alright?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{it's very cold in here. is there anyway you can turn down the air conditioning?}
<C>__{cute nurse}
<D>__{unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{my son has cancer.}
<C>__{cute nurse}
<P>__{(feels bad)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, really, if i could i would, but there's nothing i can do.}
<A>__{adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(smiles to the nurse)}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<P>__{(scowls at edith)}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{cute nurse}
<D>__{are you sure? i could get you a blanket.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no, really, i'm okay. but thank you.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{i'd love a blanket.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(to the cute nurse)}
<D>__{we're fine.}
<C>__{cute nurse}
<D>__{okay, but you let me know if you need anything.}
<A>__{the nurse smiles at adam in sympathy, he smiles back. the cute nurse exits.}
<C>__{edith}
<P>__{(re: the cute nurse)}
<D>__{i don't like her.}
<A>__{edith puts her hand on adam's forehead. he looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.}
<C>__{edith }
<D>__{you feel warm.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{take these.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you're like some kind of deranged pusher.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{do you know what it's like to fear losing your son? no. you don't. when you have children of your own we can discuss it. now take the pills.}
<A>__{adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow. edith gets up from her chair. as soon as his mother turns away, adam spits the pills into his hand. edith paces around the room looking at the doctor's various degrees on the wall. adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. edith closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination.}
<C>__{edith }
<P>__{(disapproving)}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{oh nothing.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{it's nothing, he went to a state college.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you're unbelievable.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{i just worry that you're not getting the best care possible.}
<A>__{adam can't take it anymore.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack?}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{you can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? you think i don't know what's best for you? i birthed you. you came out of me. i am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it.}
<P>__{(re: fanny pack)}
<D>__{you don't like this, well i'm sorry. it's my own way of caring.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{well stop! you're driving me crazy. with the comments and the pills every five minutes. just stop. i'm not dad. i can take care of myself.}
<A>__{edith turns away, adam's words hurt.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean it.}
<A>__{edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{yes you did. i drive you crazy.}
<A>__{adam gently puts his hand on edith's shoulder.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom.}
<A>__{edith turns to adam helpless and scared.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{you're all i've got. look at your father.}
<A>__{we see art sitting in the chair picking his nose.}
<C>__{edith }
<D>__{i've lost him. my true love, gone. i'm never going see him again, at least not in this life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he spent his whole life priding himself on his independence, always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch.}
<P>__{(to art)}
<D>__{you happy? you like shitting yourself?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{he was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. and then i had you, and that was even greater. so if i hover and threaten your independence, so what? you have a mother who loves you more than anything. is that so awful?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no. it's not.}
<A>__{adam and edith share a moment...dr. ross storms in the room carrying a stack of mri films. he seems rushed.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{sorry to keep you folks waiting. it's been one of those days...car got towed. wife double parked it.}
<A>__{adam and edith look at dr ross with blank stares.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{anyway i will cut to the chase. the cancer's not responding to the chemo.}
<A>__{dr. ross places the mri into the light box.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{as you can see...the tumor is continuing to grow here, along the nerve.}
<A>__{adam and edith squint to see what ross is talking about, but see nothing.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so what do we do?}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{we need to operate. if we don't remove it soon we risk metastasis.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but you said surgery was too risky.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{we're out of options.}
<A>__{tears roll down edith's cheek. adam grabs hold of her hand.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{but he's going to be okay, right? you're going to fix it.}
<A>__{dr. ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{this surgery is no guarantee. the risks are tremendous. and, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that adam, you'll never be able to walk again.}
<A>__{adam looks at his mother. he firmly grabs hold of her hand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{does that mean...i can get handicap parking?}
<A>__{adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across edith's face.}
