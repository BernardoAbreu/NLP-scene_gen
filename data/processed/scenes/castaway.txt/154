<A>__{chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions. then, something on the island brings chuck's eyes back from their distant focus on the horizon. from down on the beach, beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke. chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it. he kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.}
<L>__{exterior beach night later}
<A>__{chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds. the fire burns. around it is a large stack of crab shells. he stares into the fire.}
