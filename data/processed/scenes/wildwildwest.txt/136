<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{gordon, lips parched, clothes tattered, peers impatiently over the metal collar as west works on it with some lock picks. west's collar is already off.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me you had an 'auxiliary' tool kit?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i did tell you, but in your zeal to run and leap off a two hundred foot cliff, i don't think you heard me.}
<A>__{west eats the grilled gila monster voraciously. and eats. and enjoys it more. and eats. he notices gordon watching him.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{gordon looks to the heavens and recites.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{'... take physic, pomp; expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, that thou mayst shake the superflux to them, and show the heavens more just.'}
<A>__{gordon's quote has gone on. and on. and on. he notices west watching him.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you know, gordon, you can be quite annoying flaunting that fancy education.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{well, truth be told, i never had a fancy education not a formal one, anyway.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(looks at gordon's ring)}
<D>__{the harvard thing seems pretty formal to me.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{this ring? this ring isn't real. do you want it?}
<C>__{gordon }
<P>__{(takes ring off and tosses it into fire)}
<D>__{a prop. i'm an actor. or was. i gave it up. i went by the name of arthur gordon. ever hear of me?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{no. how did you wind up in this line of work?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{the pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of our american cousin a light comedy at ford's theater in washington. there was this one line i had... always got the biggest laugh in the show. one night, it drowned out the gunshot that killed president lincoln.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again.}
<A>__{close tarantula walks slowly across west's outstretched hand.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{uh... there's a spider on your hand. doesn't that bother you?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{she doesn't want any trouble. she's just trying to get warm.}
<A>__{he puts the spider down into the sand.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{how come you know so much about the desert, anyway?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{the indians taught me. i lived out here when i was a boy.}
<A>__{gordon starts to ask west something but west doesn't want him to pry further.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{hey watch }
<A>__{he points toward a small black wasp flying from above.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{the desert wasp... one of the world's great hunters. she'll kill the tarantula and lay her eggs on it, so her babies can have something to eat.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{now i'm really hungry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how did your parents, who i assume were negroes, feel about you being raised by indians?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{they didn't have much to say about it. i was sent to another plantation when i was little. ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me.}
<A>__{west can see the effect his story has had on gordon.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{did you ever see your family again?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(stands, kicks out fire)}
<D>__{they were at the camp at new liberty.}
<A>__{now they both stare into the fire. finally gordon speaks.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i will help you get him, jim.}
