<L>__{52. exterior upriver}
<A>__{thirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree. in the shady river beneath, willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair from her eyes. she hums contendedly. indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers. he notices willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low over the water and then he sees willie paddling around.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{hey, willie i think you better get out now.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{stark naked? you wish... if you're trying to seduce me, dr. jones, this is a very primitive approach.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{me seduce you? honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{somehow i feel safer in here.}
<A>__{as indy turns and starts off, willie reaches up to the tree branch above her head and grabs her underwear. at this moment we notice something awful: a boa constrictor is moving out along the branch, the enormous snake slithering over willie's clothes. willie watches indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress her hands feel something strange not the dress and not the tree limb willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! she screams as the boa constrictor falls off the t ee on top of her! indy hears the scream and hears willie calling to him. he runs back toward the river. stopping on the riverbank, he sees willie backing away in the water indiana's already starting to pull his boots off }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{indy! help me!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm coming in! what is it?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{a snake!}
<A>__{suddenly indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{a what...?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{a snake!!}
<A>__{he finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close to willie. he leaves his boots on.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{hurry, help me out of here! what're you waiting for?!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{uh, listen willie i got a better idea.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{first of all don't panic!}
<A>__{willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her arm }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's got me ! indy, help me!}
<A>__{indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes see episode one: "raiders of the lost ark").}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{don't let it pull you deeper!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's pulling me deeper!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{don't let it curl around you!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's curling around me! damn it, stop talking and do something!}
<A>__{the snake is wrapping around her body and neck her head is barely above water on the riverbank, indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood. but as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and his fear and loathing overpower him }
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{what's wrong?! indy please help me!}
<A>__{indy groans and bolsters his courage he takes two steps into the water but the complex is to strong and he can't go any further. he drops the piece of wood...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{listen, willie. do exactly what i tell you now.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{can you move your arm?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{just one arm!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{okay, i want you to lift your hand and pet the snake.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{pet it??!!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal verte brae.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the what?!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{pet it on the head! go on, pet it!}
<A>__{in the water, willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and starts petting the snake coiling around her pale body.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh my god it's going to crush me!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{keep stroking it!}
<A>__{willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back and it slowly stops thrashing in the water.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's starting to let go!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{that's good you're doing fine.}
<A>__{grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpent's head, willie keeps stroking it.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's letting fo. i think it's i think it's going to sleep!}
<A>__{indiana looks relieved. he sees the snake starting to drift away from willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her floating clothes along the way. holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the water toward indy who smiles at her weakly.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{see i got you out...}
<A>__{she slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth. indy holds his jaw as she walks away infuriates.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{thanks for nothing! i hate snakes!}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(looking at the water)}
<D>__{i know the feeling...}
