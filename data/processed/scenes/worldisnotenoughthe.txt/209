<A>__{m paces her cell. looks out, at the clock: it is midnight. twelve hours to go. she crosses her arms. returns to pacing. puts her hands in her coat pockets: she feels something. takes it out. the locator card. black and shiny, with two copper terminals on one end. m taps it on her hand. she looks back out. to the clock.}

<A>__{renard and elektra. she is on the bed, renard stroking her, worshipping her skin.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{so beautiful. so smooth, so warm.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{how would you know?}
<A>__{it stings him. elektra sits up, pulling a robe around her.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{why are you like this? because bond is dead? it's what you wanted.}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{of course...}
<A>__{renard gets up. paces the floor.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{he was a...good lover?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing out the images. after a moment, he smashes his fist through the hand painted wood. elektra looks up. her p.o.v. a huge splinter of wood juts out of renard's hand. renard looks at it, curious, unfazed.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{elektra comes to him. leads him to the bed. sits. gently removes the splinter. then, she takes an icecube from the bucket. runs it along his wound.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what about this?}
<A>__{and she runs the ice down his cheek. he shakes his head. tormented.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{now she runs the ice down her neck...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{but surely...}
<A>__{...her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between her breasts, leaving a trail. teasing...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{...you can feel this?}
<A>__{she's moving the ice lower on herself... we see her lips open, enjoying the sensation. a beat, then his smile slowly grows. as she does something else.}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(sensual)}
<D>__{remember ... pleasure?}
