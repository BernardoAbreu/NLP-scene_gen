<A>__{on the corner is a neon lit snack bar. doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. somewhere a drunk is singing. his voice echoes up the alley. carter draws alongside and notices doreen. he stops and watches her. she hasn't seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it. she looks up and he beckons her outside. reluctantly, she comes.}
