<A>__{the two guys walk and talk down a fluorescent hallway. it is well past midnight and the only patrons at this hour are tourists too drunk to sleep and compulsive gamblers who snuck out of their rooms without waking their wives. it is a weeknight and it is beginning to become painfully obvious that our boys are overdressed. the decor is nautical plaster. castings of bearded men with primitive prosthesis clutching daggers between their teeth are everywhere. all of ye olde promenade shoppes are closed.}

<D>__{well, you look money , baby. we both look money .}
<A>__{mike points to a semi curtained, semi roped off area near the baccarat tables. the clientele is classier, but they're still obviously overdressed.}
