<A>__{are dancing to a tape of 'good vibrations.' george's coat is off, his tie loose. they are near the entryway and sitting on a large staircase b.g. a young girl can be seen breast feeding her baby. george and jackie are obviously enjoying themselves. the tape ends. george's silk shirt is clinging down the center of his back. he moves with jackie, where she picks up a coke at the bar. a black in a caftan with a huge afro offers jackie a jointerior she takes a drags, she and george move outside the living room. as they walk she hands the joint to george who hands the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the door all without really losing stride. outside sammy's night there's a long rolling lawn. the lights are soft coming from the living room, the music more muted. jackie, nevertheless, is breathing rather heavily from the dancing. george is looking at her intently, too intently for her not to notice. she appears not to notice.}
