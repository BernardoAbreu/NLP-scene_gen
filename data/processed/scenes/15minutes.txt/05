<L>__{interior p.b. herman's restaurant day}
<A>__{the place is empty except for one table at the end of the bar. eddie flemming, manhattan's most famous detective, and his savvy, black partner, leon jackson are having cocktails. eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired. not only is he the best homicide detective manhattan has ever seen, he's continually mentioned in new york columns and has been the subject of several magazine articles. there's even been a tv movie about one of his biggest cases. leon has been with eddie a long time and was also featured in the tv movie. sitting with eddie and leon is robert hawkins, host and star reporter for the tabloid show, "top story." hawkins is also the best in the business and has dealt with them all: joey buttafuco and amy fisher, lorena bobbit and oj. wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. hawkins listens as eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{so we're waitin' to hit this warrant we got emergency service with the heavy weapons standin' by ready to go. i say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. i go to get the cigar and boom! all the sudden i turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. right where i was standin'. that coulda been it. i coulda had my head blown off and for what? some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. if i hadn't gone back for that cigar for a bad habit i would've had my head blown off.}
