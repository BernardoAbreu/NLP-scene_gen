<A>__{the queen's land rover, plus a protection vehicle, pulls up in a courtyard at braemar castle. the drivers jump out. go to open the doors for her.. working stalkers and ghillies stop in their tracks, and double take. faces appear at windows. stable hands, visitors and estate staff stop and stare.. we over hear whispers, `bloody hell!' `it's her!' presently, the head ghillie appears in a doorway, deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes. he walks towards the queen.}
