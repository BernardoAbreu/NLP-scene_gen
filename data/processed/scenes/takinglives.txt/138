<L>__{exterior forest crash site day}
<A>__{crime scene tape. policemen form a perimeter. the fire is out. a fire truck pumps water for a three man hose team cooling the hot metal. a plume of steam rises up the scorched tree trunk. the car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal. asher has been reduced to a charred torso.}
<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{reynaud sits by himself, his head between his knees. mourning laval, dead on a nearby gurney. director gillet crosses to him. lays a comforting hand on reynaud's shoulder. reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes his tears, embarrassed.}

<D>__{i am sorry, sir.}
<C>__{director gillet}

<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{i'm ordering you home.}
<A>__{reynaud acquiesces. a uniform escorts him out of there. director gillet crosses to grace, who was watching him. she sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle.}
<C>__{grace}

<A>__{gillet shrugs.}
<C>__{director gillet}
