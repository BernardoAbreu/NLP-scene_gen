<A>__{the post in a flurry of activity, american advisors shouting directions to dozens of latin american soldiers who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to load equipment into the other choppers. inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against the bulkhead, as if asleep. he stirs, sits up, lighting up a cigar. with fatigue showing in his motion, he leans forward, descending to the ground. a jeep pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the front seat, tossing his gear into the rear. with a lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post. in the doorway two men solemnly watch as the jeep approaches. reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two men. into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps major alan schaefer, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man. he informally salutes, general h.l. philips, 55, hardened, close cropped graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the u.s. army. he clasps schaefer warmly on the shoulder.}
