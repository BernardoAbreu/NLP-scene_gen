<L>__{interior bar & grill}
<A>__{sam is still working on his finger nails. he evidences little interest in the stranger, but at the bar in b.g. the loafers stiffen. macreedy takes a stool in front of sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what'll you have?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what have you got?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{chili wit' beans.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{chili wit'out beans.}
<A>__{macreedy winces.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't like the taste, that's what they make ketchup for.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{in that case, i will have it. and a cup of coffee.}
<A>__{the door of the bar & grill opens. smith and coley enter. they walk to macreedy, stopping just a few feet behind him.}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(to macreedy, with menacing friendliness)}
<D>__{you still around? i thought you didn't like this place.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{going to, or coming from?}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{staying put.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{no comment.}
<A>__{he turns again as sam plops an unseasonable mess of chili in front of him.}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(to smith, gesturing}
<D>__{a thumb toward}
<P>__{macreedy)}
<D>__{no comment, he says. no comment, and all the time he's got my chair.}
<A>__{macreedy smiles tiredly. he half turns toward coley.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i always seem to be taking somebody's place around here.}
<A>__{he gets up, with his chili, and sits down three stools away. coley straddles the stool macreedy has vacated. he squirms on it, his movements exaggerated. now he spins to face smith.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{this seat ain't comfortable.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i was afraid of that.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{i think i'd like the seat you're on.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(to macreedy, mildly)}
<D>__{he's as changeable as a prairie fire.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(to coley)}
<D>__{suppose you tell me where to sit.}
<A>__{coley opens his mouth but, realizing he has been outmaneuvered, closes it again. the loafers in b.g. are silent, watching. sam, seemingly oblivious to coley's pressure on macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the stranger. coley gets up slowly and walks stiff legged to macreedy. he takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing the cap, upends it over macreedy's plate. the cap is drowned in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs onto the counter.}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(to macreedy)}
<D>__{i hope that ain't too much.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(to smith, gesturing toward coley)}
<D>__{your friend's a very [...] fellow.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{sort of unpredictable, too. got a temper like a rattlesnake.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{that's me all over. i'm half hoss, half alligator. mess with me, i will kick a lung outta you. what do you think of that?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{no comment.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{talking to you is like pulling teeth. you wear me out.}
<P>__{(loudly, after a beat)}
<D>__{you're a yellow bellied jap lover. am i right or wrong?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{you're not only wrong you're wrong at the top of your voice.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{you don't like my voice?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(again turning to smith)}
<D>__{i think your friend's trying to start something.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{now why ever would he want to do that?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe he figures, needle me enough and i will crack. maybe i will even fight back. then he or hector your other ape would beat me to death and cop a plea of self defense.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i don't think that'll be necessary. you're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{before that happens, couldn't i pick a fight with you if i tied one hand behind me...?}
<A>__{macreedy rises to go out. as he passes coley, coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. the two men face each other.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{if i tied both hands...?}
<A>__{macreedy shakes free of coley's grasp. coley lunges. his big right fist streaks toward macreedy's face. macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch. he grabs coley's belt, twisting coley's body. the momentum of the swing throws coley off balance. as he goes past macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side. he plants his left foot firmly on the toes of coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring coley in place. he chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under coley's ear. with the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of coley's nose. the cartilage shatters. blood spills down his face. following through, macreedy's elbow smashes beneath coley's cheekbone. macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind burned face, finding coley's right wrist. he jerks the wrist out and backward. it snaps. coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity. his body lolls forward. macreedy steps back. he raises his right shoulder a few inches. his bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion. the fist strikes coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious. smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches coley fall. he takes half a step toward him. macreedy looks at smith. smith stops. macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. working methodically, macreedy frisks coley. he takes from a pocket a long, ugly knife. he snaps the spring and the four inch blade leaps into place. he looks at the knife in his hand and then at smith. he smiles gently, even dreamily.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(to smith)}
<D>__{wouldn't it be easier if you just waited till i turned my back?}
<P>__{(looking toward the}
<D>__{loafers at the bar,}
<P>__{then back at smith)}
<D>__{or are there too many witnesses present?}
<A>__{macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife. the are only three feet apart. smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes inside over the outline of a pistol. sam glances from macreedy to smith to the unconscious coley. he sidles toward the door and runs out fast.
