<L>__{interior ned's house day}
<A>__{ned hesitates at the front door. it's open a crack. he moves inside cautiously. there is a strange bubbling sound coming from the kitchen. he moves toward it... apprehensive. he enters the kitchen and sees... a huge bubbling pot on the stove, foam spilling over from under the lid! his mind reels! he charges out the back door.}
<L>__{exterior back of house day}
<A>__{ned bursts out the back door... camera tracking with his feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... music pounding! he sees the empty animal cage! the door is open. a fuzzy blanket hangs halfway out. shocked, ned spins around... running back toward the house... camera tracking his feet, struggling to keep up. the camera slams into a tree!... cracking the lens!}
