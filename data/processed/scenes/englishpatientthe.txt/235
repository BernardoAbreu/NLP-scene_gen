<A>__{caravaggio is at the gate to the monastery. the truck we saw before is waiting with him. the partisan with his head bandana and shotgun remains the same, but now there are children in the back and a woman sits behind the man, nursing a two year old.}

<A>__{he gets up into the balustrade, tentatively finds his balance, then starts to walk, heel to toe slowly, and then with more confidence along the long thin line of stone. the children watch intently. he turns and bows.}
