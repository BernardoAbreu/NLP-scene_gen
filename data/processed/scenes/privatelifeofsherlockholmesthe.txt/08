<L>__{interior living room evening}
<A>__{start on holmes' foot, operating a bellows. camera pans up to the top of the chemistry table, on which an elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has been set up. inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke. seated at the table is holmes, in shirt sleeves. occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope. watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest holmes adventure for strand magazine. the open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger. mrs. hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. the accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{how can you stand this? why don't you let me air the room out?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{please, mrs. hudson he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{i'm sure there's a crying need for that.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{in our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a macedonian cigarette and a jamaican cigar. sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{all of which will end up on my rug.}
<A>__{she is now pulling on the rope which lowers the dumbwaiter.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{that'll be enough, mrs. hudson.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(heading for door)}
<D>__{all right. if you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate...}
<A>__{she exits, shutting the door. for a while, the two go on working. then holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry table.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{she's right. i am suffocating.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{let me open a window.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{not from lack of air from lack of activity. sitting here week after week blowing smoke rings staring through a microscope there's no challenge in that.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{personally, i consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology...}
<A>__{holmes has opened his violin case and taken out his fiddle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{how i envy you your mind, watson.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. but my mind rebels against stagnation. it's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.}
<A>__{he has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to improvise a nervous pent up melody. there is nothing amateurish about it he plays quite well. watson resumes working on his manuscript. suddenly the music stops. watson looks up apprehensively. holmes has put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard. he opens watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of cocaine, starts toward his bedroom. watson pushes the writing arm to the side, rises from his chair.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes }
<A>__{holmes pays no attention, continues into the bedroom. watson crosses to the open door. inside the bedroom, holmes has put down the cocaine bottle on the washstand, and is rolling up his left sleeve.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, where is your self control?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{fair question.}
<A>__{from a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes a hypodermic syringe.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{aren't you ashamed of yourself?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{thoroughly. but this will take care of it.}
<A>__{he has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, and inserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to draw up the liquid.}
