<L>__{exterior chris' position night (rain)}
<A>__{later. a pool of muddy water has formed, in which a pair of buttocks sit. move up to chris still on duty, looking at his watch, drawn, drenched, pathetic, rainwater coursing down his face.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(continuing his letter)}
<D>__{... 'course mom and dad didn't want me to come, they wanted me to be just like them respectable, hard working, making $200 a week, a little house, a family. they drove me crazy with their goddamn world, grandma, you know mom, i don't want to be a white boy on wall street, i don't want my whole life to be predetermined by them.}
<A>__{a large ripping sound as the wind blows down a big tree branch onto the jungle floor. he starts, peering out. nothing. he looks at his watch again.}
<D>__{chris (v.o.) (cont'd) ... i guess i have always been sheltered and special, i just want to be anonymous. like everybody else. do my share for my country. live up to what grandpa did in the first war and dad the second. i know this is going to be the war of my generation. well here i am anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about they come from the end of the line, most of 'em, small towns you never heard of pulaski, tennessee, brandon, mississippi, pork bend, utah, wampum, pennsylvania. two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call america, they're the bottom of the barrel and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything. they're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best i've ever seen, the heart and soul i've found it finally, way down here in the mud maybe from down here i can start up again and be something i can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe ... i can see something i don't yet see, learn something i don't yet know ... i miss you, i miss you very much, tell mom i miss her too chris.}
<A>__{he moves towards junior, shakes him, but junior seems to be out of this world.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{wake up!}
<A>__{junior opens one dead eye.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{it's your shift, man ...}
<A>__{junior scowls, swears, looks around for his rifle in the mud. chris crawls back to his position, curling himself up in his soaked poncho, teeth chattering from the cold, rain splattering over him. a long beat. he sighs, the sigh kicking off the next image.}
