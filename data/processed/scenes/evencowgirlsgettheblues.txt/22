<L>__{interior outhouse day}
<A>__{jelly and delores are getting ready to run through the rain, when all of a sudden, jelly spies a barefoot cowgirl it's debbie run across the yard in her karate robe, jump on the exercycle that is rusting in the weeds and begin pumping the pedals furiously in the yammering rain.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{my sacred crocodile! she's flipped.}
<A>__{but in a minute, others follow debbie, everyone of them, in fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young cowgirls, squealing, giggling, they slide and roll on the wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough. the cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the rain goes away. play ceases. they are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one another's hair.}
