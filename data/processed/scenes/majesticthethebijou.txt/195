<L>__{interior limo (moving) day}
<A>__{leo and pete sit side by side in silence for a moment. leo breaks it.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{that was quite a show you gave them today. we shoulda sold tickets.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm not sorry for what i said.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{no, of course not, why should you be sorry? you're the new peter appleton. you exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. very noble.}
<A>__{they sit in silence again for a moment until leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he opens and offers to pete.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{leo takes one for himself and lights up. pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{when'd you quit smoking?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{luke didn't smoke.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{oh, i see. but you're not luke. you're peter appleton, the picture writer.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{not any more.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{leo, you were in there, you saw what i did. you think they're gonna let me write pictures? hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{besides, i don't even know if i want to write anymore.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(snickering)}
<D>__{what, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?}
<A>__{but before pete can answer...}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{peter, i'm an agent. i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. that's what i do. you're a writer. you write pictures. that's what you do. and trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{kid, you gave them what they wanted. this committee, it feeds on names. the more names, the better. but for some high profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{leo, i didn't give them the names. i wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{what, all of a sudden, "lucille angstrom" isn't a name?}
<A>__{pete freezes. he slowly turns to leo.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{her name was right there in front of them. they gave it to me, i didn't give it to them.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{well, that's not what they think.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{leo, she was... she was a girl i knew in college...}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you should keep track of your old school chums. turns out she eventually joined the communist party.}
<P>__{(takes a puff)}
<D>__{on top of which, she's lucy angstrom hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "studio one" on cbs.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(realization dawning)}
<D>__{oh god, oh, god, no, i...}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{so, our lawyers had a talk with the committee's lawyers. that elvin clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. they cleared you and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thank me publicly? for what? for ruining this woman's life?}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{climb down off your cross. they already knew about her.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{she was subpoenaed six months ago! who the hell do you think named you?}
<A>__{pete is dumbstruck. he slumps in his seat, ashen.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(he couldn't be happier)}
<D>__{all of which means... "ashes to ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back.}
<P>__{(takes a puff)}
<D>__{congratulations, kid.}
<A>__{pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or screaming or both.}
