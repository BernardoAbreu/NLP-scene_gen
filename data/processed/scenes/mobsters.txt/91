<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hallway of pennsylvania hotel day}
<A>__{the elevator doors slide open, and luciano and costello step out into the hallway, looking down the empty corridor to a broken nosed lug who stands guard by a door.}
<B>__{down the hallway}
<A>__{as the lug swings the door open for them.}
<C>__{lug}
<D>__{hope ya come hungry.}
<B>__{joe masseria}
<A>__{sits in the center of the room, at a table covered with hors d'oeuvres, meats and shellfish, antipasto, bowls of pastas, cheeses, sauces, fruits, and pastries. enough to feed a dozen men. he looks up from a pork loin he holds in both hands.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{excuse me bein' rude. lookin' at food always makes me hungry.}
<A>__{laying the pork loin aside, masseria rises to greet charlie and frank, wiping his hands on his napkin before shaking theirs.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{i'm glad ya come.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{what's with the banquet? this is supposed to be a private meet.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{it's only us and sonny. hey, sonny. come on out.}
<A>__{sonny catania enters by a side door and stands by a wall, regarding charlie with barely concealed contempt.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you boys carryin' pieces?}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{you tryin' ta tell me something? i don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{see if these two are my friends.}
<A>__{catania frisks them. masseria grabs the pork loin and bites in.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{so eat.}
<B>__{sometime later}
<A>__{frank and charlie sit back in their chairs, the remnants of their lunches before them. across the table, masseria has managed to consume an incredibly large amount of food. he shoves an entire pastry in his mouth, washing it down with wine. he scratches his distended belly, and belches.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you're a smart boy, charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. a man needs a family.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{i know. when the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{i got a place for you. in my family... or in the cemetery.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{never threaten me, boss.}
<A>__{masseria's only response is a cold stare.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{but yeah, i will join up.}
<A>__{beaming with pleasure, masseria picks up another pastry.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{under the right conditions.}
<A>__{masseria's enthusiasm fades as he chews on the pastry.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{i'm number two. above everybody but you, including catania here.}
<A>__{catania bristles. after a moment's hesitation, masseria nods.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{we get a fair piece of all the action, and everything from me and my associates goes into the pot.}
<A>__{masseria nods again.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{everything, that is, except not one fuckin' drop of whiskey. that stays with me and my friends.}
<A>__{a moment's dead silence. masseria's expression widens in fury, his eyes bulging from his head. the half eaten dessert explodes from his mouth, followed by a roar of protest.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you fuckin' weasel! you stupid shit eatin' weasel!!}
<A>__{masseria leaps up and smashes his wine goblet against the wall. madly, he grabs dishes and tosses them left and right. catania, frightened, backs away. costello grips the arms of his chair.}
<B>__{luciano}
<A>__{regards the tantrum with amused detachment.}
<B>__{masseria}
<A>__{picks up his chair, raising it over his head and bringing it crashing down into the table, sending debris flying. he grabs the table and flips it over, clearing his path to charlie.}
<B>__{costello}
<A>__{edges backward in his chair, but charlie doesn't flinch. masseria grabs the arms of charlie's chair and leans into his face, bellowing like wild beast. then, as quickly as the storm began, it dies. he grips charlie by the shoulders.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{you skinny son of a bitch! you're the only paisan in this whole fuckin' town ain't afraid a joe the boss!}
<A>__{masseria throws his arms around charlie and busses his cheek. charlie looks over to frankie and shrugs.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{i guess we got a deal.}
