<ACTION>__{CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING}
<LOC>__{INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by}
<ACTION>__{towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within... CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" ... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.}
<LOC>__{INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.}
<CHAR>__{BIERCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us, I have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use.}
<ACTION>__{CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.}
<CHAR>__{BIERCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just look at his accomplishments... three volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance novels... and who can forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow in our all-psychotic production of "Carousel"...}
<ACTION>__{ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that brilliant performance...}
<CHAR>__{BIERCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.}
<ACTION>__{ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top shrink. A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of seduction.}

<DIAL>__{Twenty years ago I was a lost soul. Loveless...}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(weeping, a brilliant performance)}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!}
<ACTION>__{Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.}
<CHAR>__{CASANOVA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pulls himself together)}
<DIAL>__{But my deeds have been done, and my youth is gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel world... and if I have learned anything from my wretched life it is that... When you walk through a storm, keep your head held high...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(singing)}
<DIAL>__{And don't be afraid of the dark...}
<ACTION>__{Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL... SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a paternal hug from Doctor Bierce. In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit (that's been waiting far him for twenty years). Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board stand watching, very proud... But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss... Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get in the car.}
<LOC>__{INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER}
<ACTION>__{Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his watch... CLOSE ON HIS WATCH - as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve noon... BACK ON CASANOVA -}

<DIAL>__{I'm home.}
<ACTION>__{BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads "Crime.  Don't even think about it."}
<LOC>__{EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Letters read "Six months later"... as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars... CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down the ramp.}
<CHAR>__{RED EYE 1} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Golf anyone?}

<ACTION>__{The others hadn't thought of that.}
<CHAR>__{RED EYE 3} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So what should we do with him?}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in the lake.}

<CHAR>__{RED EYE 3} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.}
<ACTION>__{But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE}

<DIAL>__{Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term loosely... Unhand that youngster...}

<CHAR>__{SHOVELER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or you're mulch.}
<ACTION>__{He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, highly amused.}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you guys supposed to be... superheroes?}
<ACTION>__{A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others. He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.}
<CHAR>__{FURIOUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We ARE superheroes!}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?}

<ACTION>__{Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{0ooooo, he's scary.}
<ACTION>__{The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A fork!}
<ACTION>__{The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver forks.}
<CHAR>__{RAJA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And there's plenty more where that came from.}
<ACTION>__{Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, taking huge bites out of it, container and all. RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.}
<CHAR>__{BIG RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{GET 'EM!}
<ACTION>__{The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming crooks... A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley brouhaha.) But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging fists... and so does the Shoveler... Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of him and crushing him under his massive weight.}

<CHAR>__{FURIOUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(faintly)}
<DIAL>__{Your mother!}
<ACTION>__{Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative voice is heard.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(0.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Is there a problem?}
<ACTION>__{Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate. ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...}
<CHAR>__{RED EYES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!}
<ACTION>__{Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca- like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he doesn't even break a sweat. The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in surrender.}
<CHAR>__{RED EYES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible}
<DIAL_PAR>__{childhoods!  (Etc.)}
<ACTION>__{Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and reporters... Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh as a daisy).}
<CHAR>__{RAJA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice work, Captain.}
<ACTION>__{But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer to Connie Chung).}
