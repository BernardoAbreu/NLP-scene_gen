<B>__{the grapes of wrath}
<D>__{"the grapes of wrath" screenplay by nunnally johnson based on the novel "the grapes of wrath" by john steinbeck}
<A>__{an oklahoma paved highway in daylight. at some distance, hoofing down the highway, comes tom joad. he wears a new stiff suit of clothes, ill fitting, and a stiff new cap, which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable. he comes down the left side of the road, the better to watch the cars that pass him. as he approaches, the scene changes to a roadside short order restaurant on the right side of the road. from it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. in front of the eatery is a huge diesel truck labeled: oklahoma city transport company. the driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door slamming behind him. he is chewing on a toothpick. a waitress appears at the door, behind the screen.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{when you be back?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{couple a weeks. don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about!}
<A>__{we see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side. getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake when tom appears at the driver's seat window.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{how about a lift, mister?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{can't you see that sticker?}
<A>__{he indicates a "no riders" sticker on the windshield.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sure i see it. but a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.}
<A>__{after a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.}
<A>__{as tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves. the scene dissolves to the cab of the truck. it is day, and tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion an inspection which tom ignores at first.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{goin' far?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{just a few miles. i'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{lookin' for a job?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no, my old man got a place, forty acres. he's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(after a curious glance)}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to tom's feet. we see tom's shoes. they are prison shoes new, stiff and bulky. curiosity is in the eyes of the driver as they shoot a swift glance at tom. tom is looking straight ahead, with the dead pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something. the driver's eyes take in tom's hands and the stiff coat.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{been doin' a job?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i seen your hands. you been swinging a pick or a sledge that shines up your hands. i notice little things like that all the time.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{got a trade?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{why don't you get to it, buddy?}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{get to what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know what i mean. you been givin' me a goin' over ever since i got in. whyn't you go on and ask me where i been?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i don't stick my nose in nobody's business.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{naw not much!}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(a little frightened)}
<D>__{i stay in my own yard.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(without emotion)}
<D>__{listen. that big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. but i ain't keepin' it a secret. i been in the penitentiary. been there four years. like to know anything else?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you ain't got to get sore.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{go ahead. ask me anything you want.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i didn't mean nothing.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{me neither. i'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{see that road up ahead?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's where i get off.}
<A>__{with a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. the truck stops and tom gets out. he look at the uneasy driver contemptuously.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're about to bust to know what i done, ain't you? well, i ain't a guy to let you down.}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{homicide!}
<A>__{the driver throws the truck into gear. he doesn't like this at all.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i never asked you!}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(as the truck moves away)}
<D>__{sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if i hadn't tol' you.}
<A>__{he looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad. a wind has begun to blow. the scene dissolves to the roadside under a willow tree in daylight. the wind is still blowing. sitting on the ground, his back against the tree, casy, a long, lean man in overalls, blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker. to the tune of "yes, sir, that's my baby" he is absent mindedly singing.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{mmmmm he's my saviour. mmmmm my saviour, mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now.}
<P>__{(looking up as tom comes down the road)}
<D>__{howdy, friend.}
<A>__{carrying his coat under his arm, tom wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{howdy.}
<A>__{he stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{say, ain't you young tom joad ol' tom's boy?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yeah. on my way home now.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{well, i do declare!}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i baptized you, son.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(staring)}
<D>__{why, you're the preacher!}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{used to be. not no more. i lost the call.}
<P>__{(reminiscently)}
<D>__{but boy, i sure used to have it! i'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners i pretty near drowned half of 'em!}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{but not no more. i lost the sperit.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(with a grin)}
<D>__{pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i got nothin' to preach about no more that's all. i ain't so sure o' things.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{maybe you should a got yourself a wife.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(shakes his head sadly)}
<D>__{at my meetin's i used to get the girls glory shoutin' till they about passed out. then, i'd go to comfort 'em and always end up by lovin' 'em. i'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. next time, do it again. i figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i never let one go by me when i could catch her.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{but you wasn't a preacher. a girl was just a girl to you. but to me they was holy vessels. i was savin' their souls.}
<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{i ast myself what is this call, the holy sperit? maybe that's love. why, i love everybody so much i'm fit to bust sometimes! so maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. there's just what people do. some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. but that's as far as any man's got a right to say.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(after a moment,}
<D>__{figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which}
<P>__{he extends)}
<D>__{have a little snort?}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(holding the flask)}
<D>__{course i will say grace if somebody sets out the food }
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{ but my heart ain't in it.}
<P>__{(he takes a long pull)}
<D>__{nice drinkin' liquor.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ought to be. that's fact'ry liquor. cost me a buck.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(handing back the flask)}
<D>__{been out travelin' around?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{didn't you hear? it was in the papers.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{no, i never. what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i been in the penitentiary for four years.}
<P>__{(he drinks)}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{excuse me for asking.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't mind any more. i'd do what i done again. i killed a guy at a dance. we was drunk. he got a knife in me and i laid him out with a shovel. knocked his head plumb to squash.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{and you ain't ashamed?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{he had a knife in me. that's why they only gave me seven years. got out in four parole.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{ain't you seen your folks since then?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(putting on his coat)}
<D>__{no, but i aim to before sundown. gettin' kind of excited about it, too. which way you going?}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(putting on his sneaker)}
<D>__{it don't matter. ever since i lost the sperit it looks like i just as soon go one way as the other.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i will go your way.}
<A>__{they pause at the edge of the shade, squint up at the sky, and then move off. the scene dissolves to the surface of a dirt road by daylight. leaves are scuttling across it. the top soil begins to fly up. it is not a hard wind as yet, but it is steady and persistent. tom's and casy's feet walk into sight.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{maybe ma'll have pork for supper. i ain't had pork but four times in four years every christmas.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i will be glad to see you pa. last time i seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the holy sperit i ever seen. he go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog wolf in moon time. fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. they was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' i give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more holy sperit in your pa after that.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(worriedly)}
<D>__{lissen. this wind's fixin't to do somepin'!}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{shore it is. it always is, this time a year.}
<A>__{tom, holding his cap on his head with his hand, looks up... the tops of the trees are bending before the wind. tom and casy continue walking.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{is it fur?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(still looking back)}
<D>__{just around that next bend.}
<A>__{tom and casy are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(lifting his voice above the wind)}
<D>__{your granma was a great one, too. the third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full growed deacon with her fist.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(pointing ahead)}
<D>__{that's our place.}
<A>__{the joad cabin is an ancient, bleak, sway backed building. there is neither sign of life or habitation about it.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{and it ain't any too close, either! we better run!}
<A>__{a dust storm, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving forward. tom and casy are running, but looking back over their shoulders as the dust storm nears. dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall. tom and casy are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the wind whipping up the dust. the two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them. the screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land. it becomes black. in the cabin, it is black too, but the sound is different. in addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house.}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{ma?... pa?... ain't nobody here?}
<P>__{(after a long silence)}
<D>__{somepin's happened.}
<C>__{casy's voice}
<D>__{you got a match?}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{there was some pieces of candle always on a shelf.}
<A>__{presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights one. he holds it up, lighting the room. a couple of wooden boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, and that's all. tom's eyes are bewildered.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they're all gone or dead.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{they never wrote you nothing?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no. they wasn't people to write.}
<A>__{from the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this was ma's. had 'em for years.}
<A>__{dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this used to be mine. i give it to grampa when i went away.}
<P>__{(to casy)}
<D>__{you reckon they could be dead?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i never heard nothin' about it.}
<A>__{dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door to the back, the only other room of the cabin. he stands in the doorway, holding the candle high. in the back room the scene moves from tom at the door across the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits motionless, wide eyed, staring at tom. his name is muley.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{tommy?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{muley! where's my folks, muley?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{they gone.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{i know that! but where they gone?}
<A>__{muley does not reply. he is looking up at casy as he enters.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(to casy)}
<D>__{this is muley graves.}
<P>__{(to muley)}
<D>__{you remember the preacher, don't you?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i ain't no preacher anymore.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{all right, you remember the man then.}
<C>__{muley and casy}
<D>__{glad to see you again. glad to see you.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{now where is my folks?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{gone }
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{ over to your uncle john's. the whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. but they can't stay there either, because john's got his notice to get off.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{but what's happened? how come they got to get off? we been here fifty years same place.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{ever'body got to get off. ever'body leavin', goin' to california. my folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{ever'body but me. i ain't gettin' off.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but who done it?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{listen!}
<P>__{(impatiently tom listens to the storm)}
<D>__{that's some of what done it the dusters. started it, anyway. blowin' like this, year after year blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{some say i am.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{you want to hear what happened?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's what i asked you, ain't it?}
<A>__{muley is seen at close range. not actually crazy, muley is a little touched. his eyes rove upward as he listens to the sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss of the sand. then...}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the way it happens the way it happened to me the man come one day...}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to muley's dooryard. it is a soft spring day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. seated in a three year old touring car is the man, a city man with a collar and tie. he hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. squatted beside the car are muley, his son in law, and a half grown son. at a respectful distance stand muley's wife, his daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted girl, watching worriedly. the men soberly trace marks on the ground with small sticks. a hound dog sniffs at the automobile wheels.}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{fact of the matter, muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. it don't even break even, much less show a profit. one man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. you just pay him a wage and take all the crop.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{but we couldn't do on any less'n what our share is now.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{the chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{i can't help that. all i know is i got my orders. they told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what i'm telling you.}
<A>__{muley stands in anger. the two younger men pattern after him.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{you mean get off my own land?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{now don't go blaming me. it ain't my fault.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{whose fault is it?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{you know who owns the land the shawnee land and cattle company.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{who's the shawnee land and cattle comp'ny?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{it ain't nobody. it's a company.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{they got a pres'dent, ain't they? they got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{but it ain't his fault, because the bank tells him what to do.}
<C>__{son}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{all right. where's the bank?}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(fretfully)}
<D>__{tulsa. but what's the use of picking on him? he ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east!}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{then who do we shoot?}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(stepping on the starter)}
<D>__{brother, i don't know. if i did i'd tell you. but i just don't know who's to blame!}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well, i'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't nobody going to push me off my land! grampa took up this land seventy years ago. my pa was born here. we was all born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. and that's what makes it ourn bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! so just come on and try to push me off!}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to the back room. the sound of the storm is heard again as tom and casy watch muley.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(without emotion)}
<D>__{they come. they come and pushed me off.}
<A>__{we see muley at close range.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{they come with the cats.}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the cats the caterpillar tractors.}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to a montage of tractors: tractors looming over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over mouth and nose one after the other, crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine men from some other world.}
<C>__{muley's voice}
<D>__{and for ever' one of 'em ten fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road. the rances, the perrys, the peterses, the joadses one after another they got throwed out. half the folks you and me know throwed right out into the road. the one that got me come a month ago.}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to muley's farm. we see the backs of muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. it is at some distance. muley holds a shotgun. his son has a baling hook. the son in law has a two by four. behind them is their cabin. frightened and huddled together are the women and children. the roar of the tractor comes closer.}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{you come any closer and i'm gonna blow you right outa that cat!}
<P>__{(he lifts his shotgun)}
<A>__{the tractor continues to lumber along, its driver goggled and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. muley lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{i tol' you!}
<A>__{the tractor stops. the driver takes off his goggles and dust mask. like the others he's a country boy. his face is sullen. muley is lowering his shotgun. there is a surprise in his face as he recognizes the driver.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{why, you're joe davis's boy!}
<A>__{he moves forward, followed by his son and son in law in the tractor. davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{i don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{then what are you doin' this kind a thing for against your own people?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{for three dollars a day, that's what i'm doin' it for. i got two little kids. i got a wife and my wife's mother. them people got to eat. fust and on'y thing i got to think about is my own folks. what happens to other folks is their lookout.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{but this is my land, son. don't you understand?}
<C>__{davis}
<P>__{(putting his goggles back on)}
<D>__{used to be your land. b'longs to the comp'ny now.}
<A>__{we see the womenfolks. a small girl pulls her mother's dress.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what's he fixin' to do, ma?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{hush!}
<A>__{back to the tractor and the men:}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat i'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.}
<C>__{davis}
<P>__{(contemptuously)}
<D>__{you ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. first place, you'd get hung and you know it. for another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.}
<A>__{and the tractor roars into slow motion again... we see the house and tractor. the womenfolks scamper out of the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. it goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower bed. muley and the two younger men walk along. breathing hard, frightened and desperate, muley is shouting warnings at davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. the dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. the womenfolks stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts from muley's wife.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{don't! please don't!}
<A>__{the little girl begins to whimper.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{i'm tellin' you!}
<A>__{the tractor moves across the yard, nosing a chair out of the way, and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house, knocking a part of the foundation away. the corner of the house sinks. muley lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and then slowly lowers it. as he stands looking at what has happened his shoulders sag. he seems almost to shrink. the scene dissolves to muley, once more in the back room of tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{what was the use. he was right. there wasn't a thing in the world i could do about it.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{but it don't seem possible kicked off like that!}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the rest of my fambly set out for the west there wasn't nothin' to eat but i couldn't leave. somepin' wouldn't let me. so now i just wander around. sleep wherever i am. i used to tell myself i was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. but i knowed that wan't true. there ain't nothin' to look out for. and ain't nobody comin' back. they're gone and me, i'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost that's all in the world i am.}
<A>__{tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{you think i'm touched.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{no. you're lonely but you ain't touched.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{it don't matter. if i'm touched, i'm touched, and that's all there is to it.}

<A>__{he takes hold of floyd's left arm. at the same time floyd swings, smacks him in the face. as the deputy staggers, tom sticks out a foot and trips him. floyd is already running through the camp. the deputy fires from the ground. there is a scream. a woman is looking down at her hand, the knuckles shot away. the coupe is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away. as floyd gets in the clear, the deputy, sitting on the ground, aims his pistol again, slowly, carefully. behind him casy steps up, gauges his distance, and then kicks him square in the base of the skull. the deputy tumbles over unconscious. tom picks up the pistol.}

<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{down that way under the bridge span.}
<A>__{casy leads the way softly. the bridge span is seen from the stream as casy, tom, and the other man wade carefully toward it. under the bridge it is almost black as they creep through the culvert. just as casy and tom step out from under the bridge on the other side, a blinding flashlight hits them, lighting them like day.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{there they are! stand where you are!}
<A>__{halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the embankment. two of them hold lighted flashlights.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{that's him! that one in the middle, the skinny one! chuck! alec! here they are! we got 'em!}
<A>__{there are faint responses from a distance. casy and tom are alone. the others have fled. the deputies approach, their lights on casy and tom.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{listen, you fellas. you don't know what you're doin'. you're helpin' to stave kids.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{shut up, you red }
<A>__{he swings the pickhandle. casy dodges but the stick cracks his skull. he falls face down out of the light. the deputies watch for a moment but casy doesn't stir.}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{looks like to me you killed him.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{turn him over. put the light on him.}
<A>__{bending over, their bodies hide casy. tom, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening.}
<C>__{deputy's voice}
<D>__{serves him right, too.}
<A>__{as the deputies straighten up, tom steps forward, grabs the pickhandle from the man who felled casy, and swings. the blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, and the scene is in semi darkness as tom swings again. there is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down. then all is confusion. backing away, swinging the pickhandle, tom bolts, splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers. they duck, and tom disappears into the night. the other men rush through the scene in pursuit. the second deputy is seen bending over the body of the man tom laid out.}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{where's that flash?}
<C>__{third deputy}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{the light flashes on the man's face.}
<C>__{third deputy}

<D>__{boy, he's good and dead! you see that fella that done it?}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{i ain't sure but i caught him one across the face, and believe me, i give him a trade mark he ain't gonna be able to shake off easy!}
<A>__{tom is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody. the scene fades out. the exterior of house 63 fades in. it is day. ma comes down the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house. inside house 63, rosasharn sits by the window as ma enters.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{anybody ask anything?}

<D>__{how's it feel, tommy?}
<C>__{tom}

<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well, the association don't like the government camps. can't get a deputy in there. can't arrest a man without a warrant. but if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp.}
<P>__{(unfolding a newspaper)}
<D>__{like last night. lissen. "citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county."}

<D>__{well, i tell you. they was a fella up the country named king got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery an' he's all a time talkin' about reds. drivin' the country to ruin, he says. got to git rid of 'em, he says. well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day. he kinda scratched his head an' he says, "mr. king, what is these reds you all a time talkin' about?" well, sir, mr. king says, "young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when i'm payin' twenty five."}

<D>__{but why? those fellas ain't botherin' nobody.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i will tell you why. those folks in to being treated like humans. suppose the government closes its camps. suppose too many people pass through 'em. well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle.}

<D>__{an' they ain't gonna be no fight, either.}
<A>__{they shake hands. the scene dissolves to the gate to the camp, at night. it is saturday evening, the night of the dance. glaring electric lights hang over the open gate. parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three men.}

<A>__{there is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, and everyone is in his or her best the men in clean washed overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and slicked down, the women in their nicest. through the gate, inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around the dance floor scores of wide eyed children. inside the gate to the camp, we see wilkie and a dark complexioned man named jule standing among a group inside watching the arrivals. they watch sharply, eyeing everyone, listening to every credential. as his employer, thomas, comes through the gate with his wife, wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake.}

<A>__{they smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments. down the road from the gate a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops. three men get out. they are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. they stroll down the highway toward the gate. the other men, deputies, sit watching them.}

<A>__{in front of the joad tent, dressed to kill, is al, ready for the festivities. he wears a tight fitting wool suit, a tie on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked down. he rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor. at another tent, a blonde girl sits on a box as al enters. casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped shirt. this is designed to stun his quarry.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{gonna dance tonight?}

<A>__{shrugging, al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the music, a very gay fellow indeed. the blonde girl's eyes follow him. then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent. on the dance floor, we see ma and rosasharn as tom enters and stands between them. this is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again. we also see the three men very casually looking around but no more casual looking than wilkie, standing just behind them, idly whistling.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{she's gettin' prettier, ma.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(as rosasharn hides her face)}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{excuse me, ma.}

<D>__{of the scene, toward}

<D>__{ you little }
<A>__{his fist goes back, his left hand reaches for al's collar. at the same instant tom grabs him, wilkie claps his hand over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all lifted bodily. there is not a sound as the three men, held in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the crowd. two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed gate and the deputies have drawn guns.}

<P>__{(waving toward the dance floor)}
<D>__{look for yourself.}
<A>__{as the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the dance floor, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened. within the joad tent at night, several hours later: the tent is black, tom strikes a match. from a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it. while he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens. in the camp street we catch sight of legs walking, the ground lighted from a flashlight. two pairs of the legs wear state policemen's leather leggings. the third pair are the caretaker's. they stop behind a car. the flashlight plays on the license plate. one of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet. then they move on. tom has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor. the legs are now seen at the joad jalopy. the light is on the license plate. the cop leans over and copies the number. they move on. tom, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him. he is wearing his clothes. we see the policeman's car at the caretaker's hut. the two policemen get into the car.}

<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{we'll have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters.}

<A>__{the truck, steaming and rattling and churning, passes the chevrolet and al leans out of the window and waves a jeering hand at it. as the joad truck pulls in front, we see ruthie and winfield laughing with excitement over the triumph. even uncle john shares the general satisfaction. grinning, he waves. as the truck moves away along the road, all three and beaming and waving. further along the truck passes a sign on the side of the road. it says no help wanted. the scene fades out.}
