<L>__{exterior beach house day}
<A>__{alvy's and annie's voices are heard over the wind browned exterior of a beach house in the hamptons. as they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the house. alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor. dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of groceries sit on the counter. there's a table and chairs near the refrigerator.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{alvy, now don't panic. please.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{look, i told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{stop it! don't ... don't do that! there.}
<A>__{the lobsters continue to crawl on the floor. annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{well, maybe we should just call the police. dial nine one one, it's the lobster squad.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{come on, alvy, they're only baby ones, for god's sake.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{if they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, all right. all right! it's all right. here.}
<A>__{she drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail. laughing, she shoves it at alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{don't give it to me. don't!}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(hysterically)}
<D>__{oooh! here! here!}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{look! look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. it'll turn up in our bed at night.}
<P>__{(they move over to the refrigerator;}
<D>__{alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly}
<P>__{dangles a lobster in front of him)}
<D>__{will you get outta here with that thing? jesus!}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(laughing, to the lobster)}
<D>__{get him!}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{talk to him. you speak shellfish!}
<P>__{(he moves over to the stove and}
<D>__{takes the lid of a large steamer}
<P>__{filled with boiling water)}
<D>__{hey, look ... put it in the pot.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i can't! i can't put him in the pot. i can't put a live thing in hot water.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{gimme! gimme! let me do it! what what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?}
<A>__{annie hands the lobster to alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping alvy and making sounds)}
<D>__{oh, god! here yuh go! oh, good, now he'll think }
<P>__{(she screams)}
<D>__{aaaah! okay.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(overlapping annie)}
<D>__{okay, it's in. it's definitely in the pot!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{all right. all right. all right.}
<A>__{she moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster. smiling, she places it on the counter as alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. i can't get it out. this thing's heavy. maybe if i put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{yeah. i'm gonna get my ... i'm gonna get my camera.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{you know, i i think ... if i could pry this door off ... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. they don't run around.}
<A>__{annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as alvy picks up the paddle. trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier. holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink. annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{great! great!}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{goddammit!}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{ooooh! these are ... p p p pick this lobster up. hold it, please!}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{all right! all right! all right! all right! whatta yuh mean? are yuh gonna take pictures now?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it'll make great alvy, be alvy, it'll be wonderful ... ooooh, lovely!}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(picking up the lobster annie placed on the counter earlier)}
<D>__{all right, here! oh, god, it's disgusting!}
<A>__{alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{don't be a jerk. one more, alvy, please, one more picture.}
<P>__{(reluctantly alvy picks up the}
<D>__{lobster again as annie takes}
<P>__{another picture)}
<D>__{oh, oh, good, good!}
