<L>__{interior corridor continuous}
<A>__{sidney flies out of the bathroom door screaming...burning up the hallway, not looking back. a teacher, hearing her scream, peer out from an open doorway...as sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running madly.}
<L>__{interior principal's office continuous}
<A>__{close on a red faced principal himbry as he reads someone the riot act.}
<B>__{mr. himbry}
<A>__{i'm sickened. your whole havoc inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me. the camera swings around to reveal two ghost masked students standing at attention. mr. himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's heads.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{two students have been savagely murdered. and this is how we express our compassion and sensivity?}
<A>__{he rips the mask off the other student.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{we throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again. you're both expelled.}
<A>__{the ghosts doth protest...}
<D>__{ghost #1 aw, come on, mr. himbry, it was just a joke. ghost #2 yeah, that's not fair.}
<A>__{a deep rooted hostility has taken over mr. himbry's face. neither student budges, scared to even breathe.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{no, it's not fair. fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are.}
<A>__{suddenly the door bursts open and sidney appears, hysterical.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{he's here...i saw him...he's here...}
<A>__{mr. himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{easy child.}
<A>__{sidney collapses in his arms.}
