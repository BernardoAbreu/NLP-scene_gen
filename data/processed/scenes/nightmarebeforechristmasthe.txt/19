<L>__{interior evil scientist's laboratory. night later.}
<A>__{the evil scientist carefully sews sally's arm back on evenso the stitches are crude and the fit awkward. the expression on her face is more tragic than ever.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{you're mine, you know. i made you.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{if you went away, what would become of me?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i'm grown up now. i have to leave some time.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{of course you do, and i want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i can't help it.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{that's twice this month you've slipped deadly night shade into my tea and run off. people might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.}
<A>__{sally whimpers sadly.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{i do the best i can to make it comfortable for us here.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{but i guess my best just isn't good enough.}
<A>__{as anxious as she is to be away from here, sally can't bear the thought of hurting anybody and instinctively tries to make him feel better.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{that's not true. it's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... i'm indebted to you for everything... it's just...}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{just what?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{just me, i suppose... i'm restless. i can't help it.}
<A>__{the scientist smiles, feeling sally under his sway again. he pats her consolingly, then finishes sewing on her arm and makes an elaborate knot at the end of his stitches. he snips the thread and puts away his sewing kit.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{it's a phase, my dear. it'll pass. we need to be patient, that's all.}
<A>__{sally heaves a big sigh.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{that's all....}
<A>__{she looks off tragically. outside, it's sunrise.}
