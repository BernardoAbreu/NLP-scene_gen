<A>__{the film is this gun for hire with alan ladd and veronica lake. it's projected on a wall in front of which stands lynn bracken and an older gentleman, in his underwear. lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye. she looks more like veronica lake than veronica lake. the film flashes over them as they kiss. the phone rings. lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it.}
