<L>__{interior courtyard day}
<A>__{rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms. a mongrel tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into jack. jack stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and fury.}
<L>__{exterior narrow alleyway day}
<A>__{jack reappears through the hidden archway and slips back into the narrow alleyway. it's like he's materialised from thin air. he takes 2 photographs: first of the hidden archway and then of the street sign: via romana. just then a man on an original 1970s ducati turns down the alleyway and drives towards him. casually, jack continues walking. the ducati gets nearer. the man on the ducati is wearing a black crash helmet with a tinted visor. jack picks up his pace. the ducati is ten metres away. jack's right hand moves towards his pocket. five metres. jack's hand goes in his pocket. two metres. bang! jack drops to his knees. bang! the ducati backfires for a second time. a pause. still on his knees, jack pretends to tie his right shoe lace. the man on the ducati stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet. he's a corpulent, ruddy faced italian man in his late sixties. he glances at jack. jack stands.}
<C>__{man on ducati}
<D>__{buon giorno!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{buon giorno.}
<C>__{man on ducati}
<D>__{da dove provenite?}
<A>__{for an instant, the directness of the question catches jack out.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{america.}
<C>__{man on ducati}
<D>__{ah! l'americano!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{si. il americano.}
<A>__{jack's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty. perhaps he's playing up on this. it suits the role of american tourist. the man laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct grammar:}
<C>__{man on ducati}
<D>__{l'americano ! l'americano!}
<A>__{a woman's voice comes from within the house loud and angry distracting the man on the ducati, who screams back passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him with a hearty slam. jack walks on.}
