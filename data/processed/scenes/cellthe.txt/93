<A>__{henry analyzes voluminous print outs from the last procedure. although his eyes are on the data, he converses with catherine in the procedure room via intercom.}

<D>__{...there was a moment when we thought we'd lost agent novak as well.}
<A>__{we see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the procedure, but henry is oblivious.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{his post procedure consciousness recovery was remarkably quick. never saw that before. hey, remember that one time...}
<A>__{he jumps when the door to the procedure room seals shut and mechanisms hum.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{catherine?}
<A>__{when he looks through the window, catherine is again suspended, the procedure under way.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{he types in a command, but nothing happens. he tires again. on another keyboard, but gets no response. when he looks at the "map" screens, he sees something odd. it's a small change, but it makes all the difference in the world.}
<D>__{interior the cell day}
<A>__{like a rock climber in a crevasse, julia shimmies up the walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using her hands and feet to push up. the tile is slippery and each movement precarious. she uses strength and balance to reach a position just below the plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie intense glow. she sees a gap between the glass and the wall and uses her engagement ring to dig into it, scape, scrape, scraping with the diamond. the shower sprays water! julia nearly loses her balance, but manages to stay pressed into the corner. she kicks the shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible, and continues to dig at the caulking around the light fixture. in the observation room, we see something unexpected. the clock reads 00:00:00. that water isn't going to stop.}
