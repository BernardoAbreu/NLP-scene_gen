<L>__{exterior premiere party night}
<A>__{a packed, glitzy party. viktor enters without an escort. despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone. he observes elaine, champagne in hand, and the younger kent, schmoozing with a group of industry movers and shakers.}
<D>__{mover shaker elaine! the picture is a revelation!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{thank you. i mean, it was a team effort }
<A>__{viktor cannot resist taking elaine's photo with a small pocket camera. elaine is unaware of the shot. viktor turns away just as elaine turns to look at him. viktor picks up a drink from the bar. a drunk woman, perched unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back jack daniels. she accidentally brushes one of her discarded glasses off the bar. viktor catches it. a hand taps viktor on the shoulder. hal stands there accompanied by his "eternity forever" co star, mac.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{is she here?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i'm fine, hal. how are you?}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(oblivious to his sarcasm)}
<D>__{somebody said she was here.}
<A>__{mac spots the two glasses in viktor's hands one glass lipstick smeared.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{oh my god, that's her glass!}
<P>__{(impulsively smelling "simone's" glass)}
<D>__{jack daniels, straight up. she is my kind of woman.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(looking anxiously around the room)}
<D>__{viktor, where is she?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she's around.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(dawning on him, glancing}
<D>__{to the far side of the}
<P>__{packed room)}
<D>__{jesus, hal... she's in the ladies room.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(unable to resist)}
<D>__{i know what you mean.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(anxiously looking to the restroom)}
<D>__{i have to talk to her about my experimental film. it's very... experimental.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{is that her? by the fountain.}
<A>__{far across the party, a woman, with a simone type hairstyle, her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{no. in fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(ignoring him, calling out to the woman)}
<D>__{simone!}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{simone!}
<A>__{several nearby guests, including elaine, overhear. they talk over each other.}
<C>__{guest 1}
<D>__{ simone's here!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(slightly the worse for drink)}
<D>__{ when did she arrive? why didn't someone tell me?}
<C>__{guest 2}
<D>__{ where is she?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ she's by the fountain.}
<C>__{guest 3}
<D>__{ simone, over here!}
<C>__{guest 4}
<D>__{ simone!}
<A>__{the rumor races through the party like wild fire. the guests surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration. the simone lookalike herself spins around.}
<C>__{lookalike woman}
<D>__{simone!}
<A>__{she gets knocked into the fountain. several other guests also fall in the stampede. back at the bar, the barman, autograph book in hand, deserts his station. viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.}
<B>__{local tv news}
<A>__{the limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced with ambulances. paramedics tend to guests, bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by simone's "appearance".}
<C>__{entertainment reporter}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{ forget "eternity forever", the big news tonight was the surprise appearance of simone. even these seen it all superstars are apparently not immune to simone fever and the resulting stampede forced organizers to bring the event to an early end. i spoke with some of the departing guests about their encounter with hollywood's most reluctant superstar.}
<A>__{cuts of interviews with various bruised guests.}
<C>__{executive 3}
<D>__{ i would say, even more beautiful in person, you have to see her to believe her.}
<C>__{male guest 1}
<D>__{ i can't reveal what we spoke about. it was... personal. simone and i go back a long way.}
<C>__{female guest 1}
<D>__{ when she talks to you, for that moment, you are the only other human being in the room.}
<C>__{female guest 2}
<P>__{(dress torn)}
<D>__{ i really don't know what the fuss is about. so over rated. she's done one film. talk to me when she's had the kind of career i've had.}
<C>__{male guest 2}
<D>__{ i do expect her to be nominated, yes.}
<A>__{we return to the live shot of the entertainment reporter.}
<C>__{entertainment reporter}
<D>__{fortunately, simone was not amongst the injured and was spirited away as mysteriously as she arrived.}
