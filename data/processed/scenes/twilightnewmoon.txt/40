<L>__{exterior bella's house day}
<A>__{bella exits to find charlie out by the street, stuffing trash into the bins. he talks with neighbor, bob marks, who also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's about time you got rid of those, bob. seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{save the lecture, chief. soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy.}
<P>__{(starts off, but stops)}
<D>__{oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem? folks are saying they're huge.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{that's just... talk...}
<A>__{ as charlie watches bella walk to her truck, head down. bob sees her, too }
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{how you doin' there, bella?}
<A>__{bella, in her own world, doesn't respond. bob gives charlie an understanding shrug and heads off. on bella as she opens her truck door. suddenly, it gets slammed shut again by charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're going to jacksonville to live with your mother.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i just don't know what to do any more. you don't act like someone left you; more like someone died.}
<A>__{she looks away. that's how it feels to her.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i'm not leaving forks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{bells, the bastard's not coming back.}
<A>__{she nods. knows this all too well.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's not normal, this behavior. and frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and your mother.}
<P>__{(gentler)}
<D>__{go to jacksonville, baby. make some new friends.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i like my old friends.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you never even see them anymore.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i do, too. in fact, i'm... um... jessica and i are going to port angeles tomorrow. shopping.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{you hate shopping.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's how good a friend i am.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(somewhat appeased)}
<D>__{alright. shopping.}
<P>__{bella (pre lap)}
<D>__{hi jessica, it's bella...}
