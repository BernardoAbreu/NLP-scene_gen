<L>__{interior throne room day}
<A>__{dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne. gatekeeper, lucifer, jimmy and a few other demons stand around.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i can't see shit. you're all still here, right?}
<A>__{adrian enters. they all cheer.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{adrian's here. you'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir.}
<C>__{dad lips}
<D>__{yea! i can't believe little nicky came through.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{where's nicky?}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{he came with you and cassius, right?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{i came through that gate alone.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{sorry, sir, false alarm.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{boooo.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{somebody explain what's going on.}
<A>__{puts the gatekeeper in a headlock.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{you'll get nothing out of me.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.}
<A>__{he twists a breast. the gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{the only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{how much time does dad have before that happens?}
<A>__{adrian twists hard.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{thirty minutes. and then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power.}
<A>__{adrian throws him down.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{all boobs and no balls.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{thirty minutes. hmmm. i hope you don't mind if i take a seat while i wait for you.}
<A>__{he moves to the throne and throws the lips off.}
<C>__{dad lips}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<A>__{he pushes lucifer out of the way.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{i don't get no respect.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{ten thousand years. and i never once got to sit here.}
<A>__{he sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little. he grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{wow. and this is just a little taste of my power.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{hell's gonna bust wide open. demons, get him out of the chair!}
<A>__{the demons approach.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{ah ah. not so fast, demons. there are a couple of million evil souls on earth ready to be harvested. anyone interested?}
<A>__{the demons stop. now loyal to adrian. all except jimmy.}
