<L>__{interior the grim house bathroom day}
<A>__{a moment later. henry throws open the door and enters. he steps over simon, who is on the floor, folded up against the toilet.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we gotta talk.}
<A>__{henry sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes the notebook from his pocket.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what the hell were you trying to do when you wrote this thing?}
<A>__{simon just looks at him, not certain what he means.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, you know you wrote it in a kind of iambic pentameter.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{iambic what?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{verse.}
<A>__{he scratches his chin and smokes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{look, in my opinion, this is pretty powerful stuff. though your spelling is neanderthal, and your reasoning a little naive, your instincts are profound. but the whole thing needs to be given a more cohesive shape. it can be expanded. followed through. unified.}
<P>__{(smokes, then)}
<D>__{you see what i'm getting at?}
<A>__{simon just stares at him, overwhelmed. henry drops the notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{are you willing to commit yourself to this? to really work on it? to give it its due? in the face of adversity and discouragement? to rise to the challenge you yourself have set?}
<A>__{simon just blinks, looks away and wonders.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{and don't gimme that wonderstruck 'i'm only a humble garbage man' bullshit, either.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it hurts to breathe.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{of course it does.}
<A>__{simon coughs and henry leans back and smokes.}
