<L>__{exterior yorktown hilltop day}
<A>__{washington's officers who include harry lee, colonel alexander hamilton, lafayette, general pinkney, and various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of the hill and wait for washington and marion who trail a bit behind them, talking privately, eating walnuts as they go. while they wait, the officers look out at the view, seeing the puffs of smoke of intermittent cannon fire.}
<B>__{washington and marion}
<A>__{finish the walnuts. they stop for a moment to catch their breath.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{i was sorry to hear about your son.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i lost another a year ago, thomas. he was only fifteen.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{i've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i lose the sons of other men.}
<A>__{they look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{life was easier when we only had ourselves to get killed.}
<A>__{they walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill. the officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at the british emplacements.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{gentlemen, what do we see?}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{mortars, center, with two lines of enfilading trenches.}
<C>__{pinkney}
<D>__{more along the right flank and behind the forward redoubts.}
<C>__{lafayette}
<D>__{a formidable defensive position. very formidable.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{they could hold out for weeks.}
<A>__{washington nods and turns to marion.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{francis, tell me about general cornwallis.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{remember braddock?}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{that bad?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{worse.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{proud, priggish and competent. a very bad combination in an adversary.}
<A>__{washington sighs.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{for those of you who don't know, we intercepted a british dispatch this morning. general clinton has sailed from new york to relieve cornwallis.}
<A>__{that hits washington's officers hard.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{how long before they arrive?}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{less than a week. sixteen ships and over nine thousand redcoats.}
<C>__{lafayette}
<D>__{sooner or later that message will get through to cornwallis.}
<C>__{pinkney}
<D>__{and when it does, he'll just wait us out.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{and when the british ships arrive, the french ships will flee. and when the french ships flee, general rochambeau and the french troops will flee as well.}
<A>__{marion speaks up.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{then you must let the message go through.}
<A>__{they all turn to marion, most of them looking at him as if he's insane.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait. he'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no, he won't. there are two things you need to know about cornwallis. first, he is a very proud man, he would rather risk defeat than share a victory.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.}
<C>__{washington}
<D>__{and what is the second thing?}
<A>__{marion pulls cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and leafs through it.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will let him tell you himself...}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"... but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome. not worthy of my attention, but demanding it; not worthy of british blood, but taking it; and not worthy of a soldier's honor, but sullying it. those nights of mine that are not sleepless, are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers..."}
<A>__{marion closes the journal.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{he has no respect for citizen soldiers. that's your bait... militia.}
<A>__{washington nods, considering it.}
