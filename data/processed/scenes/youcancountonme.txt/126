<L>__{interior exterior front door. day}
<A>__{terry opens the door. it's ron, the minister, in his civvies.}
<L>__{exterior front yard. day}
<A>__{rudy is playing basketball by himself.}
<L>__{interior sammy's house living room. day}
<A>__{terry, sammy and ron sit in the living room. sammy and ron are drinking coffee. through the window we see occasional glimpses of rudy playing basketball in the backyard. there is a heavy silence in the room.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well... i'm not really sure why you're here, ron. i mean, i realize i haven't exactly been a model citizen since i got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, i thought i was doing pretty well.}
<A>__{he turns to sammy.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{and i also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think i need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that i don't believe in any of this stuff at all }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well... i didn't mean to discourage you }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i mean it's really kind of insulting.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{can i say something here?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{sammy asked me to come and talk to you, because it's her opinion that you're not gonna find what you're looking for the way you're looking for it }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{how would she know?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{but i'm really not here to try to get you to do anything, or to believe anything. and i will tell you the same thing i told her, which is that as far as i'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example by trying to be a model for you, by the way she lives her life...}
<A>__{terry smiles.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{and that doesn't mean she's supposed to be a saint, either, if that's what you're smiling about.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i didn't realize i was smiling.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{you know, terry, a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems. drugs, alcohol, marital problems, sexual problems, health problems }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{great job you got.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well... i like it. because even in this little town, i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of people's lives. i'm not saying i'm always mr. effective, but i don't feel like my life is off to the side of what's important. you know? i don't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people. i don't feel like a negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void, with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies i can scrape together on my own...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well }
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{can i ask you, terry: do you think your life is important?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you mean like, me personally, my individual life?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well... i'm not sure what do you mean? it's important to me. i guess. and like, to my, you know, the people who care about me...}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{but do you think it's important?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i }
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{do you think it's important in the scheme of things? not just because it's yours, or because you're somebody's brother. because i don't really get the impression that you do.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, i don't think... i don't particularly think anybody's life has any particular importance besides whatever you know whatever we arbitrarily give it. which is fine. i mean we might as well... i think i'm as important as anybody else...}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i don't know: a lot of what you're saying has a real appeal to me, ron. a lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids... but i don't want to believe something or not believe it because i might feel bad. i want to believe it because i think it's true or not... i'd like to think that my life is important... or that it's connected to something important...}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well, isn't there any way for you to believe that without calling it god, or religion, or whatever term it is you object to?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yes. i believe that.}
