<L>__{exterior main street simultaneous}
<A>__{bobby, ducking around a corner, hears the brief "whoop" of the sheriff's police siren. he glances back. his pov sure enough, the sheriff's having a field day. he's just pulled sergei over. at this distance, we catch snippets of conversation as the sheriff ambles from his car, checking sergei's out of state plates.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{where's the fire sweetheart? don't know how they work things in nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.}
<C>__{sergei}
<D>__{vat? i am going 5 miles an hour! i am looking town. i not even moving.}
<A>__{we pop in closer to their conversation bobby relishing this in his mind's eye. sergei is constantly looking off to where he last saw bobby. but the sheriff, strangely, pays no attention to these looks.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{whoa, what kind of accent you got there? you one of them russians?}
<C>__{sergei}
<D>__{i am russian, da! i am also rich russian, da? maybe we work something out, my friend sheriff?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{what? you trying to bribe me, mister? just cause you russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...}
<A>__{down the street, sheriff potter is holding up a concealed gun.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{what's that? (he grabs the gun)}
<D>__{..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, ivan. you know anything about jamilla's grocery store?}
<C>__{sergei}
<D>__{what fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! you call yourself a police...}
<A>__{sergei looking bobby's direction.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{get out of the car, spread them. you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up ! you commie motherfucker. either way you're goin' to the can.}
<C>__{sergei}
<D>__{i want my lawyer!}
<A>__{sheriff cuffs sergei and sticks him in the police car. bobby can't help smiling as he turns away to the soda machine seen in an earlier scene. he comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin. though still under considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new today some luck. the icy cold soda bottle shoots out. bobby raises it to his lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once. violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a kidney punch. he stumbles forward into the soda machine, gasping. the legs of his assailant are close to him, but the face is unseen. bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine, re opening the wound. blood starts to seep through the bandage.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{bobby crumples to the ground as toby now towers over him with his fists curled and a snarl on his lips.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{get up, mister! don't ever let it be said toby tucker beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? you fucking psycho!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. i'm stompin' your ass.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you idiot! you don't even know what you're fighting over!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{my honor, that's what i'm fighting over. now get up off the ground, or do i have to whoop you where you lie?}
<A>__{jenny comes running up the street.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{toby! toby tucker, leave him alone!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you stay away, jenny. i aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.}
<A>__{jenny runs to bobby and cuddles him where he lays.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{don't be afraid of him none. i don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<A>__{bobby sees his bus ticket on the ground. he grabs for it, but toby beats him to it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{now, what's this?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{give it to me!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mexico? you going to mexico?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm leaving. you never have to see me again. just please, give me the ticket!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{this means something to you? jenny means something to me.}
<A>__{toby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nooo!}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{i'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your days. rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when i'm done. i'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick. i'm gonna ...}
<A>__{toby's words drift to bobby from a million miles away. the world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare. a primal rage wells inside of bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the soda bottle up out of nowhere across toby's head, smashing him backwards. then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on the boy's face and head. jenny screams:}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{stop it! you're killing him!}
<A>__{jenny grabs bobby's arm, literally hanging all her weight on it, stopping him from striking toby again.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're killing him! toby!? toby!?}
<A>__{jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles toby. bobby stands. he looks at toby, then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief. his bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs the pain.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you killed him! you killed him!}
<A>__{she wails in the background as he backs away, around the corner, into main street, crossing to where the phone booth is.}
