<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{claire}

<D>__{no, i mean, if you had to choose between them.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i dunno, i'd probably go live with my brother. i mean, i don't think either one of them gives a shit about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other. suddenly, from the back of the room. allison speaks.}

<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{why not? bender gets up.}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{and the bizarre thing is, is that i did it for my old man...i tortured this poor kid, because i wanted him to think that i was cool. he's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do. and i got the feeling that he was disappointed that i never cut loose on anyone, right...so, i'm...i'm sitting in the locker room, and i'm taping up my knee. and larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me. yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak. and i started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. and the next thing i knew, i uh, i jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...and my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. and afterwards, when i was sittin' in vernon's office, all i could think about was larry's father. and larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him. and the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt. it mustuv been unreal...i mean,}
<P>__{(he's crying)}
<D>__{i mean, how do you apologize for something like that? there's no way...it's all because of me and my old man. oh god, i fucking hate him! he's like this...he's like this mindless machine that i can't even relate to anymore..."andrew, you've got to be number one! i won't tolerate any losers in this family...your intensity is for shit! win. win! win!!!" you son of a bitch! you know, sometimes, i wish my knee would give...and i wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. and he could forget all about me...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling. andrew laughs briefly.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when i, when i step outside myself kinda, and when i, when i look in at myself you know? and i see me and i don't like what i see, i really don't.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? why don't you like yourself?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{'cause i'm stupid...'cause i'm failing shop. see we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, i got a f on it. never got a f in my life... when i signed up, you know, for the course i mean. i thought i was playing it real smart, you know. 'cause i thought, i will take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{why'd you think it'd be easy?}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{okay, but you have to swear to god you won't laugh...i can't believe i'm actually doing this... claire takes lipstick out and opens it. she places it between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage. when she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect. everyone claps. bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{all right, great! where'd you learn to do that?}

<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{don't you ever...ever! compare yourself to me! okay? you got everything, and i got shit! fuckin' rapunzel, right? school would probably fucking shut down if you didn't show up! "queenie isn't here!" i like those earrings claire.}

<D>__{or did your daddy buy those?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(furious)}

<C>__{bender}
<D>__{i bet he bought those for you! i bet those are a christmas gift! right? you know what i got for christmas this year? it was a banner fuckin' year at the old bender family! i got a carton of cigarettes. the old man grabbed me and said "hey! smoke up johnny!" okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay? there are a few beats.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{my god, are we gonna be like our parents?}

<D>__{what happens?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{when you grow up, your heart dies.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{who cares? allison is on the verge of tears herself.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i care...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{um, i was just thinking, i mean. i know it's kind of a weird time, but i was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on monday? when we're all together again? i mean i consider you guys my friends, i'm not wrong, am i?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{so, so on monday...what happens?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{are we still friends, you mean? if we're friends now, that is?}

<D>__{with all of you...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that's a real nice attitude, claire!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh, be honest, andy...if brian came walking up to you in the hall on monday, what would you do? i mean picture this, you're there with all the sports. i know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him!}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{'kay, what if i came up to you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{same exact thing!}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(furious and screaming at claire)}
<D>__{you are a bitch!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{why? 'cause i'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch?}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{no! 'cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone! and you don't got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{okay, what about you, you hypocrite! why don't you take allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties? or take brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high? what about andy for that matter, what about me? what would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. they'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me.}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(furious once again)}
<D>__{don't you ever talk about my friends! you don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's bmw and your poor rich drunk mother in the carribean!}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(furious and sobbing)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{and as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and i walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it! 'cause it's never gonna happen! just bury your head in the sand...and wait for your fuckin' prom!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i hate you!}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{yeah? good! there is silence until brian speaks.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{then i assume allison and i are better people than you guys, huh? us weirdos...}
<P>__{(to allison)}
<D>__{do you, would you do that to me?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i don't have any friends...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well if you did?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no...i don't think the kind of friends i'd have would mind...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i just wanna tell, each of you, that i wouldn't do that...i wouldn't and i will not! 'cause i think that's real shitty...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us... brian laughs at her.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you're so conceited, claire. you're so conceited. you're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(crying again)}
<D>__{i'm not saying that to be conceited! i hate it! i hate having to go along with everything my friends say!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well then why do you do it?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know, i don't...you don't understand..you don't. you're not friends with the same kind of people that andy and i are friends with! you know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you! brian is shocked.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i don't understand what? you think i don't understand pressure, claire? well fuck you! fuck you! brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{know why i'm here today? do you? i'm here because mr. ryan found a gun in the locker...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{why'd you have a gun in your locker?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i tried. you pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on...and it didn't go on, i mean, i...}
<C>__{andrew}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{just forget it...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you brought it up, man!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i can't have an f, i can't have it and i know my parents can't have it! even if i aced the rest of the semester, i'm still only a b. and everything's ruined for me!}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(with pity)}
<D>__{oh brian... brian bashes a chair over.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{so i considered my options, you know?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no! killing yourself is not an option!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well i didn't do it, did i? no, i don't think so!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it was a hand gun?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker.}
<C>__{andrew}
