<L>__{exterior brooklyn bridge night}
<A>__{a town car speeds toward manhattan.}
<L>__{interior town car same}
<A>__{wills and charlotte stare straight ahead, each lost in thought. the lights of the city illuminate their faces in eerie flashes. finally, wills glances over and smiles }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i have a strange feeling that you're upset with me.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, i was just wondering if you had sex with that woman.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{ever?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, the answer to that's pretty obvious. i meant tonight. on the roof.}
<A>__{wills breaks into a grin }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you're not serious.}
<A>__{wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. wills smiles back at charlotte }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{of course not. why would i want to do something like that?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{that's what i was wondering. i thought, "we're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. and if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? but he doesn't. he looks more relaxed than before the party started."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{well, there you have it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but then i thought, "he's a womanizer that's what they say." funny word, huh? sounds like some sorta machine. "and how do you get to be a womanizer? obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{sure, except that }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{let me finish.}
<A>__{again, wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror. they seem more serious now.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{anyway, there's something about being sick right here }
<A>__{she touches her own chest. her voice trembles slightly }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ that has made me acutely aware of my heart. nothing corny i mean, literally... i feel every beat. i know how sensitive it is. it reacts to everything.}
<A>__{she turns in her seat and lifts an open palm.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{if you're lying to me, i will know it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you have sex with wendy on the roof?}
<A>__{he smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. she looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt. she slips her palm inside, over his heart. still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle. their eyes are locked. ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes. she shakes her head }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{my god... oh my god.}
<A>__{she slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry. wills looks down, then glances up at the rearview mirror. illuminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience. wills looks out the window. when he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{look, i never pretended to be anything other than }
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(a piteous cry)}
<D>__{you hate yourself so much!}
<A>__{wills is stunned. he looks out the window, speechless, his eyes small and frightened.}
