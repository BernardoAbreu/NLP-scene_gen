<A>__{stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. he also has equipment strapped onto his body. he sees the charging creature. peter is trying to unsling his rifle. stephen conquers his fear of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. he crumples up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things flying. peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing creature. stephen regains his footing. the second creature is moving up the aisle. stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a nearby exhibit. it is loaded. it fires with a strumming sound and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. the zombie walks forward a few steps before it falls.}
