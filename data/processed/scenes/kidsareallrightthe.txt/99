<A>__{joni and sasha stand at the makeshift "bar". joni's downs several tequila shots quickly.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{slow down, tiger.}
<A>__{across the room, joni spots jai chatting with a waify girl in a sundress. joni drops one more tequila shot and walks up to jai and waify girl, interrupting them.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{i like the scruff. it's sexy.}
<A>__{waify girl juts out her hip territorially.}
<C>__{waify girl}
<D>__{uh, `scuuuse me...}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{you're excused.}
<P>__{(then back to jai)}
<D>__{hey, can i talk to you?}
<A>__{joni leads jai to a private corner. she leans in and kisses jai. and jai actually returns the kiss. and it's completely sweet and intimate. but then the kiss starts to morph as joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. we see jai start to pull away. but joni keeps holding him, wanting more. finally, jai breaks off the kiss.}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{joni...joni...}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{joni looks pained, embarrassed. jai keeps holding her hands.}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah, i'm fine...}
<A>__{joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused jai in her wake.}
