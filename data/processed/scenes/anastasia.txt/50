<L>__{interior rasputin's wagon}
<A>__{a lone candle lights the dark wagon. a frightened bartok, stays on the window sill.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{ummm ... father gregori? it's, uhh ... me. bartok.}
<P>__{(a sign of relief)}
<D>__{phew! not home ...}
<A>__{rasputin's face suddenly roars into frame from the bed below, his eyes fiery red and his beard wild.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<P>__{(wing to chest)}
<D>__{don't do that ... feel my heart. go ahead. i'm dying here ...}
<C>__{rasputin}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{and what do you want, my little rat with wings?}
<A>__{rasputin rises and pours himself a glass of vodka.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{name calling! that's mature.}
<A>__{rasputin grabs him by the throat.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out!}
<C>__{bartok}
<P>__{(strangled)}
<D>__{no, i really like my tongue... we're very attached.}
<P>__{(rasputin releases him)}
<D>__{oyyyy... okay, now... promise you won't get angry.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{why would i ever be angry with you, little friend?}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{yeah, right. keep that thought okay? so, i'm in town, stop by the old palace. you get a better class of bats there no tattoos or anything.}
<A>__{rasputin rummages around for a full bottle of vodka, tossing the empties which bartok has to dodge.}
<C>__{bartok }
<D>__{so, i'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can i say, i struck out. i thought chicks would like the fact that i can talk, you know but, i mean, the way things are going i couldn't get invited to a plague.}
<P>__{(a bottle smashes)}
<D>__{someone's gotta clean that up...}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{get to the point sometime tonight.. i'm late for a wenching.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like anastasia is ... still alive.}
<A>__{he tenses, waiting for rasputin's explosion but rasputin just laughs.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{impossible. that rumor's been around for years.}
<A>__{bartok hovers face to face.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{trust me, it's her!}
<C>__{rasputin}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{rodent's intuition, how do i know? she looks exactly like her. except she's taller, which is natural ... of course my second cousin treplev he never grew. looks like a little pepper shaker. he was so cute ...}
<A>__{rasputin begins a slow growl that builds.}
<C>__{bartok }
<D>__{oyyy... i knew this was gonna to upset him!}
<A>__{rasputin howls in anger and smashes his glass against the wall. he moves toward the cabinet, knocking over furniture. rasputin flings open the cabinet and we see the reliquary, glowing gently as if it were sleeping. bartok covers his eyes in fear. even rasputin seem a bit nervous in front of it.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<P>__{(with reverence)}
<D>__{source of my power. owner of my soul. i need your help.}
<A>__{rasputin takes the reliquary out of the cabinet and sets it on the table.}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{hey, she's just a kid. and she's going to paris outta sight, outta mind, outta russia.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{i cursed then all!}
<C>__{bartok}
<D>__{my aunt bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "curses were made to be broken". course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...}
<A>__{rasputin pulls out a set of russian dolls (a small painted. hollow doll with a smaller doll inside it, and a smaller doll inside it, etc.) the first doll bears an eerie resemblance to nicholas. inside the second looks like alexandra, all the way down to the anastasia doll. "the end of the line" (production number) rasputin will have a dark, menacing, deliciously scary number in which he sings of his obsession with killing the romanovs once and for all. bartok will interject comically throughout. as rasputin will conjure up tlis minions from the iquary and sing about romanovs finale, he sends them off after anya.}
