<A>__{chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the crazy horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks. behind them, the two massive samoans try to follow, but are slowed by all the foot traffic. strippers scream as they're bowled over by the obese islanders.}

<A>__{a spotlight holds on a closed curtain covering the main stage. some sort of techno limp bizkit song is playing.}
<C>__{stripper d.j. }
<D>__{annnd on stage one, put your hands together for...double staxxx!}
<A>__{all the patrons turn their attention to stage one then stu blows through the curtain, out of breath. beat. the patrons look at stu, confused. stu looks at them, equally so. the patrons start to booo, just as vick, chastity, and alan blow through the curtain after stu.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{did she just do that in heels?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i'm really starting to like this girl.}
<A>__{the guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! then the guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. they lumber down the stage and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.}
<B>__{chastity and the guys race through the strip club}
<A>__{upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again, leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and, finally, sprinting out the front door! the massive guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through a forest. just as they're blowing out of the door, however, they're clotheslined by two chairs being swung into their chests! smash! they both stumble backwards, and then four roided up strip club security guards pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.}
