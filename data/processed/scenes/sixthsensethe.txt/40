<L>__{interior mr. marschal's living room morning}
<A>__{this brownstone has been home to the marschal's for many, many years. it's filled with a lifetime of memories. memories shared by two people. two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that overlook the street... a corner table displays fancy wooden chess set. the game half finished, frozen in a layer of dust... an easel stands before a piano. the incomplete water color painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper. malcolm takes in the living room silently. he stands near the open door. cole walks through the room. tiny eyes searching carefully. he leans behind the sofa looking for something. malcolm watches cole with a crinkled brow. cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.}

<D>__{maybe jill will play for us when she gets back.}
<A>__{cole turns to find mr. marschal standing with a glass of lemonade. cole takes it from his shaking hands.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{mr. marschal shuffles over to the sofa. takes a seat. cole begins surveying the room again. beat. his eyes finally come to rest on a plant seated in the corner. he stares at it...}
<B>__{the leaves of the plant shake slightly from a breeze.}
<A>__{cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant. cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside. the}

<A>__{malcolm calls to cole under his breath.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{cole }
<C>__{mr. marschal}
<D>__{what's going on there?}
<A>__{mr. marschal strains to see across the room. cole doesn't answer either of them. instead, he continues to push the plant aside revealing an air vent. cole gently reaches over and takes off the metal face. it slips right off. cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent. they reemerge holding a stack of notebooks. malcolm becomes very still. cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to mr. marschal. cole carefully places them on his lap.}
<C>__{mr. marschal}
<D>__{is this for me?}
<A>__{mr. marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick glasses hanging from his neck. he places them on the tip of his nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.}
<C>__{mr. maschal}
<D>__{what's this? jill's keeping a diary.}
<A>__{malcolm takes an involuntary step forward. mr. marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.}
<C>__{mr. marschal}
<D>__{she's full of surprises...}
<A>__{he gets to the last book. his hands become still as he stares at the final page of writing.}
<C>__{mr. marschal}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{she hasn't written anything for some time.}
<A>__{beat. mr. marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks. looks up to cole. cole just stands quietly. mr. marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization. they gently spill down his weathered face.}
<C>__{mr. marschal}
<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{cole takes a deep breath. trying hard not to cry himself. the sight of mr. marschal weeping shakes cole. cole softly lays his hand on mr. marschal's silver hair. mr. marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand. they stay like that for a while. beat. mr. marschal lets go and brings the notebooks tighter to his body. cole quietly walks to malcolm who stands motionless. he stares down at cole in a daze. cole turns his head, crying.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{stop looking at me.}
