<L>__{interior bob's hotel room night}
<A>__{bob comes back to his room. the maids have left everything perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the tv has been left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close ups in nature while sad violin music plays. it's supposed to be relaxing, but it's just sad.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{bob lies in bed. he flips through tv channels from the remote control. he passes a japanese game show, to an 80s cannon ball run type movie with him in it dubbed into japanese. he turns it off as he hears a knock at the door. he goes to the door, and opens it part way.}
<C>__{woman }

<D>__{mr. harris?}
<C>__{bob}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. kazuzo sent me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{can i enter?}
<A>__{he pauses, then opens the door. a woman in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in. she is wearing '60s style make up. bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her. bob's pov we see her back to us as she puts a cd on the stereo it begins to play: serge gainsberg and brigitte bardot sing "bonnie & clyde". the woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to bob.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(as she tries to undress him)}
<D>__{mr. harris?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{do you like massage?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. kazuzo send premium fantasy.}
<A>__{she pushes him back onto the bed. he hesitates, but then goes along with it passively.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{my stockings.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{take them.}
<A>__{he fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no lip them... don't touch me!}
<A>__{he takes his hands back confused.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{lip my stockings!}
<A>__{he backs away, as he tries to understand her.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{lip them!}
<A>__{she throws her leg up to him on the bed.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{she pantomimes ripping them. he finally understands.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh, you want me to rip them?}
<A>__{he pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. she pretends to struggle.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{please let me go!}
<A>__{he pulls his hands away. she grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. they wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. she rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake defense.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{let me go!}
<A>__{she pulls a confused bob down on top of her. he doesn't know what she wants. she rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. he tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. he grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i think you should leave.}
