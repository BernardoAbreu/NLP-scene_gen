<C>__{norman}
<D>__{fifteen miles. i will get your bags.}
<A>__{he goes to door, opens it. the rain has slowed down considerably. he smiles at this fact, as if to communicate some pleasure he finds in it. mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits and watches as norman runs to her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of cabin one. mary walks along the porch, waits before the door of cabin one. norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches on a light. mary goes into the cabin. norman follows her.}
