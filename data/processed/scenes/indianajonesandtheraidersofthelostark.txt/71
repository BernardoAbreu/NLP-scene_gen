<L>__{interior sallah's house}
<A>__{fayah brings in a tray of food and puts it on the table. the bowl of dates is in one corner. as fayah leaves the room, the monkey slips out of sallah's lap and disappears under the table. indy leans over the food tray, his hand hovering over the dates. but he chooses some cheese and bread instead.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{and they made the calculation in the map room?}
<C>__{sallah}
<P>__{(nods vigorously)}
<D>__{this morning. belloq and the boss german, shliemann. when they came out of the map room, we were given a new spot in which to dig... out away from the camp.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{the well of the souls.}
<A>__{sallah nods, moves to the food. he picks up a date, then changes his mind and drops it, taking a bunch of grapes instead. indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a date in the other, his mind distracted. fayah enters the room just in time to see indy flip the date high into the air and try to catch it in his mouth. it bounces off his chin and falls to the floor. indy looks sheepishly at fayah. fayah picks up the fallen date and puts it in the dirty ash tray she is now removing. amir speaks in a slow, raspy voice without looking up.}
<C>__{amir}
<D>__{come. look.}
<A>__{the two men go and huddle over the old man. the monkey peeks up over the edge of the table at the array of food. he picks up a date and disappears below the table. amir points to some markings on the lower part of the headpiece.}
<C>__{amir}
<D>__{this is a warning... not to disturb the ark of the covenant.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{just want i need.}
<A>__{the monkey's paw comes up over the edge of the table and grabs another date.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{how 'bout the height of the staff? did belloq get it off of there?}
<C>__{amir}
<D>__{yes... it is here.}
<A>__{indy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another date. when he turns back to the men, the monkey's paw grabs another date. we see the headpiece in closeup on the table. amir's crooked fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom section to the break in the piece.}
<C>__{amir}
<D>__{it says it is... ten jamirs high...}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{about seventy five inches.}
<C>__{amir}
<D>__{wait! i am not finished...}
<A>__{amir's finger moves across the break as the markings continue on the sun medallion.}
<C>__{amir}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"and one jamir to honor the hebrew god whose ark this is."}
<A>__{indy, still holding the date, exchanges a long look with sallah.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you said their top section was blank. are you absolutely sure?}
<A>__{sallah nods.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{belloq's staff is seven and a half inches short. they're digging in the wrong spot!}
<A>__{sallah and indy begin to laugh. amir gives them a glance and returns to his wine. sallah leans over and kisses the old man.}
<C>__{sallah}
<P>__{(to amir)}
<D>__{a home run, my friend, grand slam!}
<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{we have a saying "a little luck is better than much smartness." indy, pardner, you are very lucky fellow.}
<A>__{indy hoots. then he takes the data in his hand and flips it high in the air. he opens his mouth to catch it, but it doesn't come down. he has inadvertently thrown it into a bowl of a hanging lamp. this makes the men laugh even harder. indy goes over and picks up another date. he turns laughing to sallah and doesn't see as the monkey's paw comes up, slowly, takes another date and begins to withdraw. suddenly the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen monkey goes into its death throws. sallah watches the paw as though hypnotized. finally the paw slips from sight and we hear a solid thump! on the floor. sallah walks around the table and looks at the floor. the monkey lies dead among a mess of date pits. indy is in a happy world of his own. he throws his date high in the air. he positions himself under it and waits for it to drop in. here it comes. right on target. as it's about to disappear into indy's mouth, sallah's hand flashes in and grabs it. indy looks mystified and disappointed. sallah motions toward the dead monkey.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{bad dates.}
