<L>__{interior the plaza girls' pov day}
<A>__{in the street, bennie's getting up, brushing the crap off. when a cab honks at him, he gives it an italian salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb it's clear: he's lost the girls.}
<B>__{drew and parker}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i don't want to do this anymore. i want to be done. no more rats, no more mob hit men.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{well, cinderella, your wish has come true.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{voila, la plaza, mademoiselle.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so? hello? no dinero?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yeah. i've got what i'd like to call a 'creative solution' to that.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no. i'm calling mom.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what good will that do?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will have her... uh...}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{have her what? hi, mom? could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{dad, then.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{dad, hey. drew. complete loser. couldn't get to an interview by myself, need full bail out. yeah. i'm the one who was going to change the world, i just couldn't get across town.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{damn it, parker, my itinerary is shot to hell! blue, red }
<A>__{her watch alarm beeps.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i don't even know what that means! i'm running out of time.}
<P>__{(noticing)}
<D>__{is that guy looking at me?}
<A>__{parker starts to look.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't look.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{when you ask a question like that, the person is going to look.}
<A>__{drew drags her behind a palm. sure enough, across the lobby, a guy dressed as plainclothes hotel security (morty sestero) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on them.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i think he was.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{drew, we haven't done anything.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm standing in the lobby of the plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment. in fact, i might attack at any moment.}
<A>__{the elevator behind them opens.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{the girls slip into the elevator. when it closes, morty's watching.}
