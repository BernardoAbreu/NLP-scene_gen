<A>__{she waves him off then she walks several yards away, holding a knapsack in her hand. she takes off a brush and runs it through her hair opens a plastic case and takes out a travel toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water from her canteen. she puts everything back in place, then looks about, sobs for several beats. one of the guerrillas hears her sobbing and enters the scene he stands a respectful distance away. jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.}
