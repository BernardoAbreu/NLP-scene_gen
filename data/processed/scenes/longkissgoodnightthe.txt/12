<A>__{if you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer one. a country highway. bathed in moonlight. crusted with snow. pontiac sunbird, wending its way through the wooded slopes.}
<L>__{interior sunbird same time}
<A>__{samantha drives while earl (the santa we saw earlier) reclines, still drunk.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you're married what now, five years...?}
<A>__{he makes a thumb circle. jabs his finger in and out of it:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you and hal, how often you two...?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? every chance we get. shut your piehole.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{don't get all snippy...}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{earl, do me a favor. every few words say "hic" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{goddamnit, i'm not drunk. would a drunk man have this much raw talent?}
<A>__{he starts playing the hawaiian nose harp. in sam's ear, she can't help it, snorts laughter the adult deer appears perfectly framed in the sunbird's headlights. dead ahead. sam looks up, face etched in sudden terror. no time to think. swerves, no dice...! broadsides the animal and it comes through the windshield. all two hundred and fifteen pounds of it. fucks up their night altogether. actually, it only makes it halfway through but the damn thing is alive. more than alive. kicking. thrashing. squawling with pain and rage. a flailing hoof takes out earl. kills him in less than a second. collapses his skull. sam rides the wheel, screaming. an antler gouges her chest. rips. draws blood. she swerves, madly hits the tree doing}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{sam goes airborne. explodes through the windshield, outward bound. shower of glass, spritz of blood... and then she's flying. slow motion, end over end... we lose all sound. silence as she tumbles. below and behind her, the sunbird noiselessly erupts. fireball, sky high sam floating. describes a lazy arc in mid air... whoomph ! disappears into the snow. swallows her, leaves a silhouette. around her, trees catch fire. burn. she lies in her impromptu sarcophagus. out of sight. the flaming deer totters from the wreck, thrashing. scene from a nightmare. nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human shaped divot arises a woman of blood. she stumbles from the drift. toward the wreck. and though it's clearly sam caine under all that crimson, there's something wrong about her eyes. en route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, its flesh scorched and torn and kills it. puts it away with a sharp crack !ing blow to the head. stands, eyes squirming with madness... the car's an inferno. earl is dead. she turns away, wiping blood from her eyes comes face to face with a snowman. a jolly white fellow. charcoal briquettes for eyes. she watches, fascinated, as he melts in the blast furnace heat with warning, she screams. crumples to the ground. the snowman's eyes fall out. he melts away and away...}
