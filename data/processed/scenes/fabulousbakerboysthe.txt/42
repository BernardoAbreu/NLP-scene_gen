<L>__{interior jack's apartment}
<A>__{jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the refrigerator. a carton of cream, a few eggs there's not much there. he takes a small container of cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an empty shelf. as he closes the refrigerator door, he glances around the apartment. it is very still, very quiet. he looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks over to the window and looks out. there is a mug of coffee there on the sill. he takes it and holds it in both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill. he sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on the keys and begins to play. "jingle bells."}
