<L>__{interior neo's apartment}
<A>__{it is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with technology. weed like cables coil everywhere, duct taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks. tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse. we turn towards the center of this rat nest of technology, following the slurping and crunching of cereal. we pass an open box of capln crunch as we find neo, a younger man who knows more about living inside a computer than living outside one.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{fuckin' idiots don't know shit.}
<A>__{he finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an anonynous message slices onto the screen.}
<C>__{screen}
<D>__{do you want to know what the matrix is, neo?}
<A>__{neo is frozen when he reads his name.}
<C>__{screen}
<D>__{superastic: who said that? jackon: who's neo? gibson: this is a private board. if you want to know, follow the white rabbit.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<C>__{screen}
<D>__{timaxe: someone is hacking the hackers! fos4: it's morpheus!!!!! jackon: identify yourself. knock, knock, neo.}
<A>__{a chill runs down his spine and when someone knocks on his door he almost jumps out of his chair. he looks at the door, then back at the computer but the message is gone. he shakes his head, not completely sure what happened. again, someone knocks. cautiously, neo approaches the door.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey, tommy boy! you in there?}
<A>__{recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it. anthony, who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group of friends.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what do you want, anthony?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i need your help, man. desperate. they got me, man. the shackles of fascism.}
<A>__{he holds up the red notice that accompanies the denver boot.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you got the money this time?}
<A>__{he holds up two hundred dollars and neo opens the door. anthony's girlfriend, dujour, stops in front of neo.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{you can really get that thing off, right now?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i told you, honey, he may look like just another geek but this here is all we got left standing between big brother and the new world order.}
