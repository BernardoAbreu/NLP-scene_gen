<A>__{the debris has been shoved up against the walls. peter and michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped over the table. peter is giving mary her bottle. michael is looking at mary as though he were seeing her for the first time.}

<A>__{peter is in bed, completely out of it. michael is changing mary very carefully. he puts one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. he lays mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and peter's body. michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out. once he's alone, peter leans over the basket. mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously. peter switches off the light.}
