<A>__{there's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in here. the room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. it's going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' cartons stacked all over the place. louis is drinking a can of pepsi, and he looks pretty damned tired anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand. he finishes the last of the pepsi and surveys the living room. he sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket, and lights one. he drops the spent match in the empty can, and taps into the can during the scene. sound: feet coming down the stairs. the door on the far side of the room opens and rachel comes in, wearing a nightgown.}
