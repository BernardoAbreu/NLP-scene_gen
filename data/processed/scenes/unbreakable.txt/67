<L>__{interior stadium tunnel afternoon}
<A>__{an unlit arched concrete passageway. the sunlight from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.}
<B>__{the thunderous cheers of the sixty thousand fans in the stadium echoes from the field into the tunnel.}
<A>__{david enters the tunnel and joins elijah. he hands him a ticket.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i got you a seat in the seven hundred level.}
<P>__{(points straight up)}
<D>__{it's nose bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{probably the army jacket. those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you thought he was carrying a knife?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought he was carrying something.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{but not a knife?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like on t.v.}
<A>__{elijah stares at david. the stadium cheers bounce off the gray walls.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you have good instincts when it comes to things like that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{telling when people have done something wrong?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{have you ever tried to develop it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know what you're asking?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you're skill.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{listen. i got to be on the sidelines during the game... you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at }
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. x ray vision, things of that sort.}
<A>__{david exhales slowly as he stares at elijah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay, i don't want to play this game anymore.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{it's an exaggeration of the truth. maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... or the level of what they've done wrong.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the guy might not have been carrying anything.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.}
<A>__{david's walkie erupts with noise.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i have to go now.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{one last question.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{quick.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{the car accident you were in... was there anyone else involved?}
<A>__{the two men stand very still in the tunnel.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. my wife megan. she was in the car with me.}
<A>__{david turns and starts down the hall. david talks back over his shoulder.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{have a good life elijah and try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location.}
<A>__{elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of david dunne jogs down the darkness of the tunnel.}
