<L>__{exterior golden gate racetrack day}
<A>__{beautiful day. roper and mccall leaning against the rail at the walking ring. the horses are being paraded and saddled. roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. mccall seems totally disinterested.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you know why i like the track?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{you're a compulsive gambler?}
<A>__{roper ignores that.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{because there are a multitude of possibility's. everything is there to see if you know what to look for. you have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation.}
<A>__{roper points across the ring to a particular horse.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{see the four horse. dropping in class. no works. front wraps. looks like he's broken down. but notice the woman in the sun hat. she's the owner. she wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. he's live. we use him.}
<A>__{mccall listens indifferently.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{see the favorite? tail up. washy. he doesn't want to run today. cross him off... now the six looks good. on his toes. coat shiny. this trainer jockey combo does well. we can't leave him out.}
<P>__{(turns to mccall)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i have two words for you... seek help.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i have three words for you... ex ac ta.}
