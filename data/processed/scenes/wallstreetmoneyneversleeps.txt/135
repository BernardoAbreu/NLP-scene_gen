<A>__{the cabin of a boeing 777 as jacob opens up a copy of barron's... gekko on the cover under the caption "what's his next move?"}
<B>__{and bretton woods}
<A>__{in an official office of our federal reserve bank, proudly signing the documents...}
<B>__{and along the banks of the persian gulf}
<A>__{dubai in the background. jacob waits against a bench. and across the way he sees... approaching him... gordon gekko.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{did you see barrons?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you finally got the cover.}
<A>__{gordon nods.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{everybody thinks you got rich of betting against the system. if they only knew...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{the powers that be will never let that happen.}
<A>__{jacob's not arguing it...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how much is enough, gordon?}
<A>__{gordon laughs with a shake of the head.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i've been asked that before...}
<P>__{(and then)}
<D>__{they took a hundred, twenty two thousand, six hundred and forty hours from me... for a goddamn victimless crime. all the while i sit in my 8 by 12 and watch real crooks by the thousands give out mortgages like candy, package them into unexplainable derivatives and spit the cancer out into the world.}
<A>__{and he just shakes his head...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{and when i get out... who's there waiting for me? nobody.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you better believe i'm going to get mine.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you're not going to miss america?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i will always have america... it's why i'm here. i'm buying the island.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know it's kitschy but it's fun and good for business.}
<A>__{looking over the water...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{i have a lot business abroad now. interests in an australian copper mine, a german solar company, some russian oil pipelines, a casino in macau... see jake, america just isn't where the action is anymore.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what happened to the precious depreciating asset of time?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{it still trades...}
<A>__{and he turns to jacob with a smile...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{... but i'm a billionaire now, pal.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm out, gordon, i'm done trading.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i don't know why. you pulled it off, kid, you took him down granted with my help but you atoned for zabel's sins with bretton's money.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as i see it, you're just getting started.}
<A>__{and jacob stops walking then slowly turns to gordon with...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{did you ever really want to reconcile with her?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<P>__{(of course i did)}
<D>__{i'm human.}
<A>__{glaring at him...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{then why did you do it?}
<A>__{and gordon... strongly holding jacob's glare... simply replies...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{same answer.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but it didn't work.}
<A>__{gordon sadly shrugs...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{i've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i know. she doesn't want it... we don't want it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because it's not about what you have... it's about what you do. and gordon it's never about the money.}
<A>__{gordon shakes his head.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{that sounds good. i bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow. but champ, it's idealistic... and idealism kills every trade.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{winnie will realize that at some pointerior.. and then we'll be fine.}
<A>__{and jacob finally looks away... in pity.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{see jacob the hustle we all fall for is actually thinking we can fight what's inherent, what's inevitable... that we can somehow undo what genetics, or god, or whatever name you wanna tag it, has placed deep inside of us. because whether it's greed or revenge or the compulsion to chase... it all amounts to the same thing... loss of control. and it's always going to be there and it's always going to be stronger than you, pal.}
<A>__{now walking again...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{it's why bubbles will always exist and it's why we're all currently in this mess.}
<A>__{joining gordon's stride...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{winnie's pregnant.}
<A>__{and gordon stops walking.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{it's going to be a boy.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's bad out there, gordon, people are panicked. they're not looking to their government. they're not looking to their trusted advisors. they're looking to you.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you want me to buy?}
<A>__{and jacob moore... slowly confirming...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{publicly and aggressively.}
<A>__{gordon just looks at him.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{but they're all lemmings. simple psychology. you once said every crash should have a jp morgan to step in and save it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well gordon this is your chance to be jp morgan.}
<A>__{and now gordon shakes his head...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{we're far from the bottom. it'll be a dead cat bounce.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it'll buy us time. that's all i'm asking for... time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{time for the new administration to put their plan into action.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{what do i get in return?}
<A>__{as gordon turns... takes in the city of dubai... in all of its ridiculous splendor...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{full clemency.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you can offer that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{your daughter can. she works with the new secretary of treasury now.}
<A>__{considering that...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{winnie. me. your grandson. something money can't buy... a family.}
<A>__{and gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it all to register, then...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{sorry son that's simply a trade i cannot make.}
<A>__{and as gordon gekko walks off... leaving jacob moore behind...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) you wanna know what the mother of all bubbles was? us. the human race. scientists call it the cambrian explosion, from the cambrian fauna.}
<B>__{and ronald reagan national airport}
<A>__{as jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see winnie waiting for him...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) it happened 530 million years ago... when all of the sudden, there was the seemingly rapid appearance of most major groups of complex animals.}
<A>__{and as they embrace...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) and from it was born humanity.}
<B>__{and gordon gekko}
<A>__{being led through a massive empty space... office space...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) it was an explosion of life. scientists will tell you it was unprecedented, excessive and by the standards of evolution time... happened in a flash.}
<A>__{the city of london outside the large windows...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{suddenly the world had millions of new species... just like that.}
<A>__{this will be the home of his new international empire.}

<A>__{at his desk in his 15 cpw penthouse...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) see bubbles are the purest form of darwinism.}
<A>__{... looking over pages and pages of destruction... andrew zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) they teach us what we didn't know and they remind us of what we forgot...}
<A>__{and bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out the pages then tearing them in two...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) they kill excess and they lean out the herd.}
<A>__{... methodically... page by page... over and over again...}
<B>__{and gordon gekko}
<A>__{sitting in his massive london office. it's empty. it's night. he's completely alone. he looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of jp morgan and uncle sam rowing that boat. then he looks down at an old picture of winnie... she's probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her baby brother, rudy. and gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before finally...}
<D>__{gordon gekko (v.o.) (cont'd) they actually bring us back to the necessary simple...}

<A>__{as the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging bull of bowling green park across the way... gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the new york stock exchange. and gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears inside.}
<B>__{and winnie and jacob}
<A>__{greet the morning in their small washington dc apartment. winnie pouring coffee, jacob turning on the tv. and on the screen is a picture of gordon gekko walking the floor of the new york stock exchange under the graphic... "gekko now betting on a recovery."}
