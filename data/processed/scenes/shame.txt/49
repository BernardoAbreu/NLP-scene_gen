<A>__{brandon and david enter a beautiful bar. a spectacular 180 degree view of manhattan. the room has the most elegant decor. it is to die for: metropolis meets blade runner, a glittering new york skyline to the north of the room, the grey endless black of the hudson river to the south. it surpasses david's idea of classy. the murmur of conversation the shake of cocktails mixed }

<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{my little town blues }
<A>__{suddenly sissy's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic, slowly but quietly captivating }

<A>__{even david's listening now }
<C>__{sissy }
<P>__{(singing)}

<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{a number one...}
<A>__{sissy draws out the note, bringing the song momentarily to a silence sissy's misty eyes open as brandon at last looks at her, the moment oddly fragile between them, brutal and yet tender. even david sensing something until }
