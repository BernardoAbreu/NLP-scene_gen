<L>__{interior apartment hall}
<A>__{electra's front door opens slowly. timidly, she steps out of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is standing in front of jennifer's door. she starts to knock, but stops herself. she isn't sure she should do this. she paces, then turns to the door. she knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear. she stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when she hears jennifer.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{hello? ken, is that you?}
<A>__{electra panics. the door knob turns, the door opens and jennifer looks out into the hall. it is empty.}
