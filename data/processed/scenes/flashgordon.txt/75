<A>__{as the tree men scurry to obey, barin moves forward, reloading and cocking his weapon. the stricken lion man comes into view. incredibly, the glass arrow in his back has transformed him into a statue of ice. at barin's footfall, he disintegrates in a tinkling fall of frozen shards. the tiger man is poised behind a tree near the lodge, panting. he is a magnificent creature, with a horn sticking out of his forehead. he tenses, hearing the birdlike calls of the advancing hunters. closer, closer. angle widens. we see another pair of lion men crouching nearby, terrified. the line of tree men comes into view. the crouching pair look in appeal to the tiger man by the tree. he watches a beat, waves them to run backward, then covering the escape of the others, tiger man charges into his enemies headlong. from lodge balcony pov shot flash and aura watch the fight. tiger man's rage is magnificent as he flails the nearest tree men without regard for their number. he has flattened half a dozen when suddenly barin's upper line of tree men leap down on him from the branches above, and he is buried under their sheer weight.}
