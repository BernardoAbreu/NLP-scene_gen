<L>__{interior bb's apartment living room}
<A>__{this is a two story apartment in a renovated building. it has high ceilings and exposed brick. it is sparsely furnished, but what there is is decent looking. we see nora and bb dancing closely in the shadows of the dark ened room. a frank sinatra record is playing on the record player in the b.g. it is "in the wee small hours of the morning." a bottle of wine is on the coffee table. the remains of chinese food in containers are alongside.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'm still nervous.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{well, i guess that's to be expected. you want me to take you home?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{no, not right now.}
<A>__{they dance quietly for a moment.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{every time i listen to sinatra, i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late 40's... you know, a busboy job... sinatra used to play at the 500 club, and we used to take our dates and say, 'hey, you wanna go and hear sinatra?' then we'd just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music. i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown.}
<A>__{nora laughs.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'd go with you and lean against the door.}
<A>__{they dance for a bit and look at one another. he leans toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. then the record sticks on the words "that's the time"... "that's the time"... "that's the time"... bb slips off one of his loafers, while still embracing nora, kicks it so that it hits the side of the record table. the record slips a little and continues to play correctly.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(she looks at bb)}
<D>__{you've got a pretty good aim.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i sure do.}
