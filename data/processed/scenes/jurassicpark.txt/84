<A>__{nerator building ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall. her face is lit by a flashing yellow light. she bangs her head on a pipe. she rubs her head.}

<D>__{damn, i banged my head.}
<C>__{wu }
<D>__{oh that's good, that must be the water pipe. you're really close now, there's a cabinet just above your head. reach up and open it. the handle turns to the left.}
<A>__{ellie turns the handle. the cabinet opens.}
<C>__{wu }
<D>__{it's a large throw switch. pull it down, count to three, and push it back up. that's all there is to it.}

<D>__{one }
<A>__{back on grant and kids just a few feet from the bottom of the fence. back on ellie }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{two }
<A>__{back on grant and kids grant and timmy jump down. lex is just behind. her sneaker catches in the fence pattern. she pulls on it. back on ellie }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{she throws the large switch back. back on lex she jumps off the fence. her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground. camera pushes in on lex it celebrates her narrow escape. grant casually leans against the fence to help lex with her shoe. nothing! still no electric fences! the visitor's center is in sight. they all turn to each other. elated.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we did it!}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{we made it!}
<A>__{lex jumps up and down. grant smiles, high fives timmy. back on ellie the siren and the flashing lights stop. the room lights go on. ellie turns to go back upstairs. her foot slips, she falls to the ground. she has slipped on a pool of blood. she jumps up, recoils. it's arnold. she squelches a scream, covering her own mouth. smash! ellie screams as a raptor lunges at her. he jumps down from above the water pipe ellie banged her head on. ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft. she dives into it. the raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall. ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push against the wall, begins to climb up. the raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside. ellie scrambles up. the raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned. ellie continues her scramble up the shaft. at ground level, she slams her feet hard against a vent, popping it open. scraping the wall and banging against pipes, she races toward the door.}
