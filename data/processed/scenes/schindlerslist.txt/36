<A>__{klonowska, wearing a man's silk robe, traipses past the remains of a party to the front door. opening it reveals a nice looking, nicely dressed woman.}
<C>__{klonowska}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{a series of realizations is made by each of them, quickly, silently, ending up with klonowska looking ill.}
<C>__{schindler }
<D>__{who is it?}

<A>__{schindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife. behind him, through a doorway, klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{she's so embarrassed look at her }
<A>__{emilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom, catching the girl just as she looks up embarrassed.}

<D>__{oskar, please }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what }
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i don't have to like her just because you do. it doesn't work that way.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you would, though. that's what i'm saying.}
<A>__{his face is complete innocence. it's the first thing she fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now. klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self conscious.}
<C>__{klonowska}
<D>__{goodbye. it was a pleasure meeting you.}
<A>__{she shakes emilie's limp hand. schindler sees her to the door, lets her out and returns to the table, smiling to himself. emilie's glancing around at the place.}

<A>__{he nods; he's proud of it. he studies her.}
<C>__{schindler}
