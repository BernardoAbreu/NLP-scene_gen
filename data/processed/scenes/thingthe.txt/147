<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{now why'd you go and...}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it. i know what you're up to. don't think i don't. and if anyone tries to get in here i've got rope. i will hang myself before it gets to me.}

<D>__{you promise?}
<A>__{nauls picks up the tray, heads back mumbling.}
