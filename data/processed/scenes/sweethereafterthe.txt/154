<L>__{interior dolores's house day}
<A>__{mitchell is getting ready to leave. dolores is still grasping onto abbott's hand.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{i have a question for you, mr. stephens.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{what's that, dolores?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. that's how i remembered it. but the truth is, i might have been doing sixty. or sixty five. and if that's true, that i was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{that would complicate things.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{because i'd be to blame, right?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{billy ansel will insist that you were driving fifty one miles an hour. just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{he knows that? billy?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{yes. he does.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{billy said that?}
<A>__{mitchell nods.}
<C>__{dolores }
<D>__{you've talked to billy?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{and billy told you that he'll tell that to...}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{mrs. driscoll, if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.}
<A>__{pause. mitchell plans his next step.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{but in order to do that, you must let me bring a suit in your name charging negligent infliction of emotional harm. that's what i'm now asking you to consider.}
<A>__{pause. dolores is lost.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{it's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{what other people?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{who's been talking to you about what i'm feeling? who should care about what i'm feeling?}
<A>__{mitchell stares at dolores.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{dolores, people have to know that you've suffered too.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{and they won't understand until you let me clear your name your good name once and for all. will you let me do that? will you let me do my duty?}
<A>__{suddenly, abbott says something. he twists his face around his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a string of broken syllables and sounds. after this outburst, dolores looks at mitchell, a comforted smile on her face.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{you heard what abbott said?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{anything you didn't understand?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{there might have been a word or two that slipped by. maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{abbott said that the true jury of a person's peers is the people of her town. only they, the people who have known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt or innocence. and if i have committed a crime, then it's a crime against them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment.}
<A>__{mitchell stares at abbott, who stares back.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{that's what he said, is it?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{yes. abbot understands these things.}
