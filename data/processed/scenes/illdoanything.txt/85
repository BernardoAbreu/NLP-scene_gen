<L>__{interior screening room day}
<A>__{ad libbed enthusiasm... mostly about the girl...}
<B>__{on cathy}
<A>__{as the conversation about the girl grows more pointed... cathy, impassive outwardly, recoiling inwardly.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay, come on... let's have our creative meeting right here.}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{well, i'd sure go to bed with her.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(professionally concurring)}
<D>__{very fuckable.}
<C>__{male casting person}
<D>__{i'd sure fuck her.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay... that's her... what about him?}
<C>__{female d person}
<D>__{i think he's a very good to excellent actor i do...}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{but there's something...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you wouldn't want to fuck him?}
<C>__{female d person}
<D>__{well, six years ago, maybe.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think he's talented and attractive.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so you'd want to fuck him?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{he might be light in that area.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{the man is talented. if you get one of those directors who like actors, i think...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{a director can't make you hot if you're not hot. you'll end up with warm which is death.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(defending matt slightly)}
<D>__{we laughed.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{let me ask you something... would you fuck him?}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{everything doesn't boil down to...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{let me stop you before you embarrass yourself.}
<A>__{burke rises and addresses his staff... the camera has his back in the foreground as it moves towards a rendezvous, burke moving too as he continues...}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{we all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to. everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say... i'd fuck her... i wouldn't fuck him... and you're ducking it... i want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue.}
<A>__{and now burke and camera meet up the effect being that he is talking directly to us as he continues.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{we do have some kind of responsibility to the audience... you just saw his screentest... so, if this is the first time you saw the guy, do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends, 'i'd sure go to bed with him; oh god, would he be something.' would you, cathy?... i'm being real here.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay, so let's keep looking.}
<A>__{they file out. cathy gets up several beats later than the others... and follows them out, avoiding nan's look.}
