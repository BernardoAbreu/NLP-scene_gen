<L>__{ext moments later approaching men's changing rest room}
<A>__{eddie is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the men's restroom. he stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. we see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one.}
<L>__{ext moments later in front of men's changing rest room}
<A>__{skeeter pops his head out and looks around. he sees eddie in the distance about 5 minutes away, and putting a plastic liner in a trash can. he nods and disappears into the men's room. skeeter and snitch appear at the door, look out, and see eddie finishing his card trick. he presents a card for the girls to see, and the both nod encouragingly, but as they walk off, they look at each other and shrug. skeeter and snitch take off, barely containing their laughter. but eddie notices them leaving. all of this has happened under the watchful though distant eye of alex. eddie goes into the restroom. eddie exits the restroom and goes to his cart. at this point alex and robbie walk up to him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hey eddie. what have you got?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{water balloon.}
<A>__{eddie reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors, eyeing them.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you got this?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah. rookies!}
<A>__{alex and robbie walk away as eddie places a "restroom closed" sandwich board in front of the door. just then big mike rushes up.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(big hurry potty emergency)}
<D>__{oh eddie. listen, i know you're working but you hold on for just a minute. i've been so busy, and i really gotta go.}
<A>__{eddie motions and tries to find the words....}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{but....no....}
<A>__{but big mike is already in. eddies waits for it, wincing, and there is a loud splash...}
<C>__{big mike }
<P>__{(echoing through the door)}
<D>__{yeahhhah that's cold!}
<A>__{eddie just shrugs and puts away his scissors.}
