<A>__{groggily, jamal sits up and groans. somehow in the tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year old. and salim a strong fourteen year old. through the haze of pain and dust, jamal sees something glinting in the distance something impossibly beautiful.}

<D>__{salim? is this heaven?}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{you're not dead, jamal.}
<A>__{jamal clears his head. sees salim picking himself up from the ground. but the apparition is still there.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{so what's that?}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{they stare at the apparition. the unmistakable outline of the taj mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the morning sun. nothing could be more beautiful.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{some hotel, huh?}
