<A>__{prison waiting area. ann, wearing a wool suit, waits among black hispanic friends and relatives. the first scene without letour: she sits quietly. a corrections officer instructs the visitors to proceed. ann walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting area. letour, in prison fatigues, sits at a table. he sees her, smiles. ann sits down. this is not her first visit.}

<C>__{letour}
