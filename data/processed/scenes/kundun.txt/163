<L>__{interior dalai lama's room, chinese guest house night}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso snoops around this room. he opens drawers, cabinets, just as a child would. he finds odd little pieces of ceramics, pens, paper. he moves to the bathroom, runs a bath. hot water. electricity. this is the modern world.}
<L>__{interior mao's office day}
<A>__{the dalai lama sits beside chairman mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces. mao offers his holiness a plate of chinese delicacies. we notice that mao's clothes are shabby and old. (his suit is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey drab). his cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn. but, his shoes, are beautifully polished. he has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny. later, chairman mao and the dalai lama sit across from one another. tenzin gyatso takes notes as mao speaks.}

<D>__{i am so glad that tibet has come back to the motherland.}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso quietly sips his tea.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i have great hopes for the future of our co operation.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement. we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet. the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people. changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.}
<A>__{mao speaks and moves very slowly. he pants and wheezes. he appears to be sick. tenzin gyatso takes notes.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i am happy to hear you say this, chairman mao. i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax, and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{good. very good. tibet is a great country. a a wonderful history. long ago, you even conquered part of china. but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. in twenty years time you could be ahead of us. then it will be your turn to help china.}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso writes in his notebook.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{you know, i have great respect for your lord buddha. he was anti caste. anti corruption. anti exploitation. for some, politics and religion can mix.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{for me, i think such a mix is crucial.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{have a sweet. made in my home province. the kind my mother used to make.}
<A>__{the dalai lama accepts.}
