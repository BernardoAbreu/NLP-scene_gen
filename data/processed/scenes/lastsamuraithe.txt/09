<A>__{algren lies in his cramped berth. can't sleep. a sudden flash: on the wagon of dead bodies, algren's eyes open to stare into the unblinking eyes of his brother, davey, half his face shot off. he tries to move but be is buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him. blood drips down into his eyes and mouth, blinding and choking him. back to the ship: algren awakens, bathed in sweat. terror. a silhouette in the doorwa y. colonel bagley stands looking down at him.}
