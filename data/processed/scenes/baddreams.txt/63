<L>__{interior therapy room day}
<A>__{cynthia's scream trails off as she throws herself back from the pillow. the unity house members and harris are all gone. the group therapy people all turn to her in amazement.}
<B>__{miriam}
<A>__{open mouthed, she drops the match she's holding to light a cigarette. it sizzles on the rug. alan stomps it out, rushes over to cynthia, who sags in his arms,}

<L>__{interior alan's office day}
<A>__{cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in alan's office. the room is decorated in comforting tones, with sierra club posters and outdoors y souvenirs. the late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds. alan sits beside cynthia on the couch, concerned. berrisford sucks on his pipe, makes notes. wasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own little notebook.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(softly, tense)}
<D>__{...they... they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers... they were... happy. because it was going to be their break with the world... a world that didn't understand them. i don't remember if they took a vote or if harris just... decided. but they all agreed. they were... happy... smiling... laughing... crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline...}
<C>__{wasserman}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{ jesus }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{somehow, i... i knew it was wrong... i ran... when he threw the match, i was at the other end of the hallway... there was a flash... and a... like a wind, or the hand of god picked me up, threw me... the ceiling fell in... when i opened my eyes...}
<P>__{(she looks up)}
<D>__{i was here.}
<A>__{hettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her eyebrows inquisitively at alan. alan nods immediately: hell, yes. hettie comes in, gives cynthia her medication. wasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(to wasserman)}
<D>__{if that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson?}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{the plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else... we knew there'd been an explosion... we just didn't know how or why.}
<A>__{berrisford stands, approaches wasserman as the police officer closes his book, moves to the doorway.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{well. you must be pleased. closing a case after... what is it, twelve years?}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{who says it's closed?}
<A>__{the medical people look at him. cynthia's thoughts are elsewhere.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{when the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. now she remembers they committed suicide...}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{but she, of course, was innocent. who knows what she'll remember tomorrow? running for help... or pouring gasoline on the fire?}
<A>__{he goes out.}
<C>__{hettie}
<D>__{that man's a candidate for shock therapy... with a car battery right to the cojones.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no... he's right. i am guilty.}
<A>__{they look at her, startled.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{i'm guilty of lying... to unity house. i promised to be part of it... forever. they expected me to keep my word.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{they still do.}
<A>__{she stands, goes out. alan and hettie look worried. berrisford looks... unsurprised. he turns to alan.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{well, alan. still think she doesn't belong in the group?}
<A>__{alan just looks at him.}
