<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{hello, rob. remember me? i'm ray. ian.}
<A>__{rob says nothing.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{i thought maybe we should talk. sort a few things out?}
<A>__{rob is disoriented on the way to angry. dick and barry's ears perk up.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what needs sorting out?}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{come on, rob. my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{funnily enough i haven't been too thrilled about it.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{we are not talking jokey understatement here, rob. we're talking actionable harassment. ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah, well, i've stopped all that now.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{we've noticed and we're glad. but, you know... how are we going to make peace here? we want to make things easier for you. what can we do? obviously i know how special laura is, and i know things can't be good for you at the moment. i'd hate it if i lost her. but i'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, i'd respect that decision. do you see what i'm saying?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{good. so shall we leave it at that then?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{think about it, rob.}
