<A>__{legs hobbled, uniform soiled, jordan is led past a row of huts. she looks like she got hit by a train and got back up. jordan's pov: vision still blown out. but inside the pen, we make out 40 trainees now. one guy wrings out a sock and drinks from it. jordan moves past huts. volatile voices spill out as trainees get interrogated. jordan's pov: outside one hut, we see flea. at least we think it's him: strapped face down to a table, sobbing quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup. they broke him and it's an ugly, ugly sight.}
