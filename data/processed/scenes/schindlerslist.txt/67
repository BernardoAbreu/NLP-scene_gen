<L>__{exterior schindler's building evening}
<A>__{elegantly dressed for a night out, schindler and klonowska emerge from the building. as they're escorted to the waiting car, schindler hesitates. a nervous figure in the shadows of an alcove is gesturing to him, beckoning him. schindler excuses himself. klonowska watches as he joins the man in the alcove. their whispered conversation is over quickly and the man hurries off.}
<L>__{exterior prokocim depot cracow later night}
<A>__{from the locomotive, looking back, the string of splattered livestock carriages stretches into darkness. there's a lot of activity on the platform. guards mill. handcards piled with luggage trundle by. people hand up children to others already in the cars and climb aboard after them. the clerks are out in full force with their lists and clipboards, reminding the travelers to label their suitcases. climbing from his mercedes, schindler stares. he's heard of this, but actually seeing the juxtaposition human and cattle cars this is something else. recovering, he tells klonowska to stay in the car and, moving along the side of the train, calls stern's name to the faces peering out from behind the slats and barbed wire. an enormous list of names several pages worth on a clipboard; a gestapo clerk methodically leafing through them.}
<C>__{schindler }
<D>__{he's essential. without him, everything comes to a grinding halt. if that happens }
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{itzhak stern?}
<P>__{(schindler nods)}
<D>__{he's on the list.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{he is.}
<A>__{the clerk shows him the list, points out the name to him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, let's find him.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{he's on the list. if he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. he's on the list. you can't have him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm talking to a clerk.}
<A>__{schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man who isn't ready yet to bring out his heavy guns:}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{sir, the list is correct.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i didn't ask you about the list, i asked you your name.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{klaus tauber.}
<A>__{as schindler writes it down, the clerk has second thoughts and calls to a superior, an ss sergeant, who comes over.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{the gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{my plant manager is somewhere on this train. if it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why.}
<A>__{the sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the pin, at the man wearing them.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(to the clerk)}
<D>__{is he on the list?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(to schindler)}
<D>__{the list is correct, sir. there's nothing i can do.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{may as well get your name while you're here.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{my name? my name is kunder. sergeant kunder. what's yours?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{schindler.}
<A>__{the sergeant takes out a pad. now all three of them have lists. he jots down schindler's name. schindler jots down his and flips the pad closed.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{sergeant, mr. tauber, thank you very much. i think i can guarantee you you'll both be in southern russia before the end of the month. good evening.}
<A>__{he walks away, back toward his car. the clerk and sergeant smile. but slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow arrange such a fate... all three of them schindler, the clerk and the sergeant stride along the side of the cars. two of them are calling out loudly }
<D>__{clerk & sergeant stern! itzhak stern!}
<A>__{soon it seems as if everybody except schindler is yelling out the name. as they reach the last few cars, the accountant's face appears through the slats.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there he is.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{guards yank at a lever, slide the gate open. stern climbs down. the clerk draws a line through his name on the list and hands the clipboard to schindler.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{initial it, please.}
<P>__{(schindler initials the change)}
<D>__{and this...}
<A>__{as schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the carriage gate closed. those left inside seem grateful for the extra space.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{it makes no difference to us, you understand this one, that one. it's the inconvenience to the list. it's the paperwork.}
<A>__{schindler returns the clipboard. the sergeant motions to another who motions to the engineer. as the train pulls out, stern tries to keep up with schindler who's striding away.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i somehow left my work card at home. i tried to tell them it was a mistake, but they }
<A>__{schindler silences him with a look. he's livid. stern glances down at the ground.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it was stupid.}
<P>__{(contrite)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{schindler turns away and heads for the car. stern hurries after him. they pass an area where all the luggage, carefully tagged, has been left the image becoming black and white.}
