<L>__{interior trevor's living room night (short while later)}
<A>__{dimly lit. trevor stands in front of the television set, staring at a late night repeat of "talk soup." insert talk soup a clip from "sally jessy rafael" or "jerry springer." one of those sturm und drang moments. everyone points the finger at everyone else. no one willing to take responsibility for themselves. only partially watching the television. his eyes are fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind, lost to the world.}
