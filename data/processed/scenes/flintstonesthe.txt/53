<A>__{fred and barney cough in the rising dust. neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the slate company's granite doored safe... ... and right beside it is the xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. recovering its composure, the xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.}
