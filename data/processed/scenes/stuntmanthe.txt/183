<L>__{interior nina's bedroom}
<A>__{scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost completed packing for tomorrow's departure. nina lies in bed staring into nothing, cameron beside her. each is talking aloud to himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact with the other. the room is semi dark, except for the nightstand light on cameron's side, by which he studies the booklet eli gave him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...it was so unnecessary...for christ's sake, i'm no shrinking violet...i've had my ass pinched black and blue by account execs for not showing enough enthusiasm for vitalis. but this from eli...it was so pointless...sadistic...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{..."open all windows slowly to keep pressure from caving in the roof, should an unexpected skid achieve aquatic consequences..." that's kind of witty.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(still in her own world)}
<D>__{...could've handled it later on. it doesn't look so raunchy after it's cut...maybe i'd of got them stoned...something...but for eli to trap them like that...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(eyes on the book)}
<D>__{beautiful...there's a second school of thought that says the first school is all wet. it says, "keep the windows rolled up tight and wait for the air bubble."}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{say it was an accident...benefit of the doubt. but then to use me that way...like a gadget...why would eli do that? he's not a cruel man...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{he's not a cruel man. he's a crazy man. a maniac.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"the water pressure at two hundred feet can crush a man into the size of an egg." he wants to get that on film....so he's gonna kill me.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(jumping out of bed)}
<D>__{what in god's name are you babbling about?!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{it's a rotten shame about your folks and your naked ass, but dying always scared me a little, okay?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...and you are beginning to scare me. you're talking like a wild man!...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{did you know that eli almost strangled a man because he stopped the camera when burt got killed?!}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what is going on in that head of yours?! you take the word of some...malcontent...technician!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...i saw the bruises!}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...and i saw eli that night when he had to tell burt's brother on the phone...i saw the tears.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{she saw the tears! did you ask him what he was crying about?! 'cause you can bet your sweet tits, it wasn't over burt. he was crying over losing his fucking shot!}
<A>__{to keep from exploding, nina opens her luggage and furiously starts repacking.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{didn't they give i.q. tests in the army? what did you get...minus twelve? haven't you figured out yet why he's working himself to death? what his film is all about? he's trying to tell people not to kill each other!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{and you know what? you want the shock of your life...? i understand what the son of a bitch is saying, and he may be right...which makes me what? minus twelve, the dumb schmuck with a gun. that doesn't change the fact that he's crazy. if he had his way, there wouldn't be a soldier left alive by morning. but all he's got on hand is me. i don't know if he is doing it consciously, but it's a hell of an idea. if he can really get it on film, a genuine dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before your very eyes, i mean the real mccoy...that's gotta help his picture...then he's killed two birds with one stone. it's got a nice logic. trouble is, both birds are me.}
<A>__{against her instincts, nina is emotionally affected by what cameron says.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{stop it...sweetheart...i'd die if anything happened to you.}
<A>__{the telephone rings. her head whips to look at it. it continues ringing, but she doesn't move.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{it's my father...i won't talk to him...you're all driving me crazy...i won't talk to him.!}
<A>__{cameron calmly picks up the phone.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{hi...hello?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{tell them i'm not here. tell them anything. tell them i'm working.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(glancing at nina)}
<D>__{okay, chuck. i will meet you in an hour.}
<P>__{(he hangs up)}
<D>__{for me. amazing how they keep secrets around here.}
<A>__{he walks over to the still stricken nina and tenderly embraces her. she leans against him, the trembling subsiding.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what if i told you i wasn't going to do the stunt?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i'd say fine.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{and what if i told you i was gonna get out of here tonight...and that i want you to come with me?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(upset and confused)}
<D>__{but there's just one more day of shooting...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what if i can't wait?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i...i have two more scenes...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{that's a shame.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...i could meet you...}
<A>__{when he doesn't answer, nina resorts to her last defense, irrational anger.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{...look, don't do the stunt! if you believe eli's a killer, call the police...why are you doing this to me? that's all i need right now, with all i've been through!...for you to give me now or never ultimatums and tell me my director is insane!...}
<A>__{by now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one suitcase to another as cameron silently watches her.}
