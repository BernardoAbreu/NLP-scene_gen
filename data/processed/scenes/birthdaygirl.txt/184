<D>__{you still love me? eh? of course you do. come here. yuri won't be here for a while. come on babe.}
<A>__{he takes his shirt off nadia glances up with horror, she sees john in the doorway. alexei turns to see john stand by the door, holding a little silver gun.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{john and nadia look at each other.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{what the fuck is he doing here?}
<A>__{he looks at the little gun.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{that's that cigarette lighter i gave you isn't it?}
<A>__{alexei stands. john takes a step back. alexei walks calmly towards john and throws a punch. it catches john right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{alexei turns round to see nadia holding the knife. he is dumbstruck.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{what? what are you doing?}
<C>__{nadia}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{alexei kicks john in the ribs.}
<C>__{nadia}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{he looks at nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing the knife at him. he suddenly looks completely punctured. john has struggled up again and stands behind him. they are both looking at nadia.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{what. you're what? you're with this creep now.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{leave him!}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{you have. you've actually fallen for this prick.}

<D>__{no i haven't.}
<A>__{alexei looks dumbstruck. he laughs emptily}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{babe it's me. i won't let you get away.}
<A>__{nadia stares back at him. the seconds pass. she speaks in a whisper.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i will kill you if you try.}
<A>__{in the impasse, john picks up a lamp and hurls it at alexei's head. it is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short. in the confusion. alexei grabs nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. he grabs the knife, just as john brains him with one of the guitars. it emits a fruity final chord.}
