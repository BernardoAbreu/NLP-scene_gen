<L>__{interior funeral home. eliot's office moments later}
<A>__{eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. he looks at a day calendar on his desk. idly flips over the page from tuesday to wednesday.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. it's no problem at all.}
<A>__{he glances at his watch.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i will pick up the deceased from the hospital. yes. this afternoon? that'll be fine. it's my pleasure mr. merano.}
<L>__{interior hospital morgue day}
<A>__{gray bodies lie on steel tables. eliot moves over to one of the corpses. examines it with professional interest. just then the old guy walks in with the pale assistant pushing a gurney with a body wrapped in plastic sheeting.}
<C>__{old guy}
<D>__{well here he is. frank merano.}
<A>__{the old guy hands eliot a clipboard. the assistant unties the rope. pulls the plastic sheeting away.}
<B>__{on body}
<A>__{frank (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened. his head split open. grotesquely distorting his face.}
<C>__{assistant }
<D>__{ouch. that had to hurt.}
<B>__{morgue}
<A>__{eliot glances at the assistant with disdain. signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the old guy.}
