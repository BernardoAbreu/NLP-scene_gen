<L>__{exterior veranda ali, bundini, bingham + angelo day}
<A>__{waiters scurry. ali talks to a blonde reporter from france and settles next to lloyd price, without a shirt. everyone crowds around their table. a zairian interpreter and lieutenant nsakala are present. ali disregards their presence because his attention tracks... ali's pov: veronica seen over the heads of zairians. she's 5 feet 10 inches tall. without acknowledging she's the object of ali's attention, her radar tells her she's the object of ali's attention.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{say, girl...!}
<A>__{veronica turns, sees ali. lights up.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{c'mere. i know you?}
<A>__{over veronica as she makes her way to the table by ali's side, where he takes her hand in his.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{veronica porche.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{like the sports car.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{but with a little something extra.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{veronica, i know you now. c'mere, sit down.}
<A>__{he steers her into the chair next to him, which is immediately vacated by lloyd price.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{you with don?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don brought me here, but i'm not "with"...anybody.}
<A>__{the others are paying them no attention. bundini stands to talk to howard cosell. there's an ocean of side conversations. ali's presentation to veronica is natural, open admiring. it is not seduction. it's more seductive than seduction. she feels from ali nothing predatory or exploitative...only the warm rays of the sun from his open face and appreciating eyes. still holding her hand...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{where you from?}
<A>__{meanwhile, george foreman, with sadler, moore, broadus, sees and laughs at ali and veronica and onto george foreman going into hotel.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{l.a. but my people are from louisiana. we're creole. so i'm african, french, spanish, my mother's grandfather was jewish.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(looking at her admiringly)}
<D>__{well...they all came together real nice.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you know...}
<P>__{(hesitating; low)}
<D>__{...i'm glad you said what you did. you made sure this fight stays here.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{all them writers in there think foreman gonna...kill me!}
<P>__{(eyes go wide)}
<D>__{what you think?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{ali, boma ye.}
<A>__{meanwhile, 15 chinese and some vietnamese approach and wait patiently. ali has to force his attention away from veronica to respond... they all bow. he bows. the zairian interpreter translates english to french to another zairian, who speaks mandarin. it all gets lost in chaos while bingham shoots pictures and a plimpton type explains pedantically to bundini...}
<C>__{plimpton type}
<D>__{...she's an african "succubus." means witch doctor.}
<C>__{bundini}
<D>__{succubus? suck my dick. they ain't room in africa for more than one witch doctor. and that's b'dini.}
<A>__{the eyes of some of the asians are very emotional. ali stands up and bows to them. chinese bow themselves away. ruth pointer arrives. ali kisses her. she sits, but talks to bingham.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you been to hong kong? taiwan? thailand?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i can't go there. all the ladies out there from indonesia, japan, hawaii, india...}
<P>__{(high pitched voice, imitating female fans)}
<D>__{"ali i i e e e! ali e e e! oh, muhammad al i i i!"}
<P>__{(speaks in faux foreign}
<D>__{language, imitating}
<P>__{female fans; to bingham)}
<D>__{you seen those people from thailand? i was in bangkok i couldn't walk.}
<P>__{(laughter; hangs his head)}
<D>__{i couldn't...i just couldn't do nothin'. "get me outta this country!"}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{the women were so pretty...}
<C>__{bingham}
<D>__{'b b b bout hong kong, man?! you know what i heard?}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{ladies in thailand, their hair comes down to their knees...and they about veronica's complexion...and they bad!}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{but they ain't nothin' like the "sisters."}
<P>__{(holds veronica's}
<D>__{hands, looks deep}
<P>__{into her eyes)}
<D>__{ain't nothin' like the sisters!}
<A>__{veronica laughs as ali mocks swooning over her... another news crew arrives.}
<C>__{news cameraman}
<D>__{champ...}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(to veronica)}
<D>__{let's go for a ride.}
