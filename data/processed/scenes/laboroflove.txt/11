<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{where ellen and her husband are eating breakfast. claude is now in a cage in the hallway. mr. maurice parker eats a buttered piece of raisin bread. he is a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his new york times folded into a manageable rectangle. this is a man who has been seated a great deal of his life... the type of man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage. he feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that glowing smile. he smiles back. ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now displayed proudly on the window ledge.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{the flowers... they're beautiful.}
<A>__{maurice studies them.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{they are... who sent them?}
<A>__{beat. this takes ellen by surprise. maurice catches the expression.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you thought i sent them?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{there was no card.}
<A>__{maurice reaches over and searches the bouquet.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{have i forgotten something? is this a special day?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{it's just a regular day.}
<A>__{maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{it's from dan and kate wilkins... for dinner last week...}
<A>__{maurice hands ellen the card, she looks at it uninterested.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{it's a special day isn't it?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{well, i'm sure it's not christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... i know it's not new years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and i'm sure it's not our anniversary, because i didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'pick out something pretty'... yes maurice i'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.}
<A>__{ellen begins to eat. maurice stares at her...}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you're mad at me... you were beaming a minute ago, but since i didn't send the flowers... now you're mad at me.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{why would i send flowers? what's the occasion.}
<A>__{ellen instantly becomes emotional.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{occasion? because you love me... that's the occasion.}
<A>__{ellen returns to eating. maurice stares at her quietly.}
