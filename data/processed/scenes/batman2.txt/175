<L>__{exterior park mouth of tunnel that moment night}
<A>__{a police car streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before bruce and dick roll out into the snow, still grappling. bruce flings the kid into the bridge abutment. dick lands hard; when he looks up, his eyes widen, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. the body armor the gold and black emblem on the breastplate and above it all, the face of bruce wayne, exposed to view... as a siren howls nearby, bruce flattens himself against the bridge. like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. the kid sizes up the situation immediately. he nods his head up and down. then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to bruce. bruce is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. he pulls on the coat, gives dick a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off.}

<D>__{no. wait!}
<A>__{bruce turns, uncertainly. dick throws him his woolen ski cap. the kid giggles oddly, uncontrollably. then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. as he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost feral shriek which is obviously intended to divert the cops. bruce makes haste in the opposite direction.}
