<A>__{kane comes out of the door. mrs. tinsdall has been joined now by a fairly sizable turnout of servants. they move back away from kane, staring at him. raymond is in the doorway behind kane. kane looks at the glass ball.}

<D>__{close the door, raymond.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{yes, sir.}

<D>__{raymond }
<P>__{(he is almost in a trance)}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{yes, sir }
<A>__{one of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up. kane shakes the ball again. another flurry of snow. he watches the flakes settle then looks up. finally, taking in the pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the glass ball in his coat pocket. he speaks very quietly to raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{keep it locked.}
<A>__{he slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way to let him pass, and watching him as he goes. he is an old, old man!}
