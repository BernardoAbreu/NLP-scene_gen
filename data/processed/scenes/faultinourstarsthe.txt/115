<L>__{int exteriorhazel's car day}
<A>__{hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash in an effort to find what van houten gave her. she's about to give up when she sees it crumpled up into a ball beneath the passenger's seat. she reaches under, pulls it up, and unwraps it. as she reads, we hear:}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{mr. van houten, i'm a good person but a shitty writer. you're a shitty person but a good writer. we'd make a good team. i don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what i saw you have plenty, please fix this for me. it's a eulogy for hazel.}
<A>__{hazel is overcome with emotion.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{she asked me to write one and i'm trying, i just, i could use a little flair. see the thing is... we all want to be remembered.}
<A>__{she smiles to herself, remembering: that first time gus and hazel ran into each other. the staring contest in support group.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{we all want to leave a mark.}
<A>__{ driving (badly) in gus's car. their first kiss at the picnic by "funky bones."}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{but not hazel. hazel is different. hazel knows the truth. she didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one. and she got it. maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply. and isn't that more than most of us get?}
<A>__{ and back to hazel reading the letter, tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{when hazel was sick, i knew i was dying. but i didn't want to say so.}
