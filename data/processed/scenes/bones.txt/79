<A>__{her usual small crowd arrives for her seance, all hoping this will be the night they reach their loved ones' spirits. from outside, through the window, we see pearl greet and seat each of them around the table. she starts lighting candles.}

<A>__{patrick and cinnabar sipping a little remy in his room. alone at last. awkward. intimate. he refills her glass.}

<D>__{she doesn't want me here. with you. in this house.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.}

<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i'm sure i can make your mother like me. but then do i gotta worry 'bout your father?}
<A>__{suddenly their banter is dead. her face looks stung, like he'd slapped her.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i don't know anything about my father. i never met him. momma won't talk about him, either.}
