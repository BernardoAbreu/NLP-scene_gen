<L>__{exterior revie's home leeds day (1972)}
<A>__{don revie speaking to journalists outside his home..}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{i haven't personally heard mr. clough's comments, but they have been reported to me, and our solicitors are looking into them. if i could offer mr. clough some advice ...i think he'd be better off keeping his opinions to himself...some of these allegations against leeds united and his fellow professionals are an absolute disgrace...}
<A>__{and we're into a quickfire montage of: clough appearing on half a dozen tv shows. quick, controversial, charismatic, witty. a natural media star, (we intercut our actor with the genuine archive footage)}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{don revie? ooooh.}
<P>__{(shudders playfully)}
<D>__{don't mention that name to me.}
<C>__{david frost}
<D>__{it's really like the other house of commons. you hate to mention him. why?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i hate to mention him why? because he's a very talented man and i don't like him.}
<A>__{the audience laughs.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{he's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable. but i just happen not to like him. and i don't like the way he goes about football either. football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit.}
<C>__{david frost}
<D>__{sure. 45aa}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and er... it makes the game go round. half the country don't like a labour government. it just happens that the other half do.}
<C>__{david frost }
<D>__{why don't you want me to ask why you don't like him?}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{because i can't tell you. it's impossible. we'd get closed down, david.}
<A>__{john sadler, pipe smoking football journalist, sits in a television studio, (calender)..}
<C>__{john sadler}
<D>__{brian, you've been called big headed, arrogant, brash, the lot }
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{by your profession, john, yeah.}
<C>__{john salder}
<D>__{sure. and a whole of it right too.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and a whole lot of it wrong.}
<C>__{john salder}
<D>__{fine. i will concede that. so how would you define your approach to management, apart from being brilliant?}
<A>__{all laugh.}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(laughing, rubbing eye)}
<D>__{good lad. thank you for the compliment. it's very, very difficult when you get asked a question like that.}
<A>__{david coleman, black and white footage, speaking into a bakolite telephone..}
<C>__{coleman }
<D>__{you've achieved something here that most managers struggle for years to achieve this. it's come to you very young. are you surprised? 45ab}
<A>__{clough sits at home, his son on his lap.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{suprised, david..but more than surprised, delighted. it's nice isn't it. for the good guys to win for once.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{which for you was the most important match to win and the best performance from your point of view...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{beating leeds united, obviously. always a particular pleasure that.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{brian, you've also done it on comparatively small gates, which i know has niggled you a little bit during the season.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{niggled me, david, it's absolutely made me blazing. to be honest, i know what i want to achieve, i know what the people of derby want us to achieve, but when you've got a chairman not wanting to put his hand in his pocket...}
<A>__{michael parkinson, the highest rating talk show on tv..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking i'd love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally i believe the very sight of them brings the game into disrepute (some clap in the audience). and every time they open their mouths it kills it. because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man or men can stop me talking to people like you. i love football. it's deep, it goes right down through. it's in every nerve, vein, you name it. it consumes me. and when i have to come and talk about i like the passions of football to come out. because there are not enough in the game. 45aa}
<C>__{clo ugh }
<D>__{i like a bit of the honesty, i like a bit of the truth. i accept without any shadow of a doubt that i talk too much, apart from on this show.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{parkinson }
<D>__{how do you react when someone says "boss, you're doing it wrong?"}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{i say, "how do you think it should be done?" we talk about it for twenty minutes, then we decide i was right.}
<B>__{black and white archive tv footage of mohammed ali}
<C>__{mohammed ali}
<D>__{..the world knows who i am. the world knows i talk a lot.}
<P>__{(mo re)}
<C>__{moh ammed ali }
<D>__{but there's some fellow in london, england named...."brian clough"...}
<P>__{(audience laughter)}
<D>__{anyway i heard all the way in america, they say he's another mohammed ali. well, there's just one mohammed ali. i want you to know...}
<P>__{(jabbing finger)}
<D>__{clough...you are not taking my job. i'm the talker. now, clough...enough. stop it!}
