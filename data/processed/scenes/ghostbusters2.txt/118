<L>__{interior van horne station night (later)}
<A>__{stantz, spengler and winston come down the stairs into the station, guided by a very old map of the underground city.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{this is it. van horne station. right where the old transit map said it would be.}
<A>__{they cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{let's get a sounding on the depth of that flow.}
<A>__{stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of it attached to his utility belt.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{stand back.}
<A>__{he takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and casts it out into the middle of the flow. the plumb bob sinks and spengler reads the depth.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{six feet seven eight }
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{that's it. it's on the bottom.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{nine feet ten }
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{is the line sinking?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{no, the slime is rising.}
<A>__{stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the platform and around his boots.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{let's get out of here, boys.}
<A>__{he starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck. spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them. as their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge, stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. spengler lets go in time but winston doesn't. he is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow. stantz and spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in after him.}
