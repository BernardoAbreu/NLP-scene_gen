<A>__{ramirez drives and we see that he has an earpiece which goes to a walkman tape recorder. we hear the instructions being fed to him on the tape in jack's voice:}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you're going to hit a hairpin turn exactly three tenths of a mile from the stop sign which should be coming into view at any minute.}
<A>__{new angle on the stop sign up ahead back to scene ramirez starts to slow down.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't stop for the stop sign, don't even slow down for it. you've got to hit the hairpin exactly fifteen seconds after you pass the stop sign.}
<A>__{we see that ramirez is going 60 miles an hour down the straightaway. the road is open and straight ahead. ramirez drives on with total focus. the intensity is obvious. up ahead is a hairpin turn.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the hairpin should be right in front of you. keep your focus. you can't let down even after you negotiate the turn. you never know what's going to be around the next corner... or whose life might depend on your reactions.}

<A>__{on the jeep as it negotiates the turn.}
