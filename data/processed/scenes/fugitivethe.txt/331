<A>__{the cop stares at sykes' window when suddenly we hear fire sirens, and a pair of fire trucks turn onto the street and pull up across the street from the unmarked car blocking the view of sykes' house. firemen climb down and move to a nearby building. the street begins to fill up with people. the cop stares at the commotion directly behind him. he becomes so engrossed in the action like everyone else that he fails to see sykes, using the distraction, exit his apartment and walk calmly away from the scene.}
