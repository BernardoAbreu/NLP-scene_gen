<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{olive half listens in class, while her english teacher mr. griffin (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `the scarlet letter.'}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{so, i'm feeling like the cat's ass, because everyone thinks i've been deflowered. i'm surprised at how empowered i felt by this prevarication. i wonder to myself, would i feel this invigorated if i had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach infested dorm room? probably not.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{ironically, we were studying `the scarlet letter,' but isn't that always the way with these teenage tales? the literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted. i consider this.}
<P>__{(pause.)}
<D>__{then i think: except for `huckleberry finn.' i don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy.}
<C>__{mr. griffin}
<D>__{alright, so thoughts?}
<A>__{nina raises her hand. mr. griffin points to her.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i think hester prynne was excuse my language a whore.}
<C>__{mr. griffin}
<D>__{you don't see her as a victim?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{why should i? she brought it on herself.}
<A>__{nina whips around and gives olive a look, surprising her.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{perhaps you should embroider a red a on your wardrobe?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{perhaps you should get a wardrobe, you twat!}
<A>__{the class bursts into surprised laughter. even mr. griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction.}
<D>__{olive (v.o.) (cont'd) admittedly, not my best line. but it was provocative enough to land me in the principal's office.}
<A>__{mr. griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk. he starts writing something on a piece of paper.}
