<A>__{he hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. it's fairly non descript place, boxing materials, etc. products seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc) he lifts a loading door and light pours inside, washes out the frame....he's silhouette....camera follows him out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks down towards the street..... ...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway, shared with a few other nondescript places and an auto mechanic....distant sound of a car speeding and skidding.... ....hold, then: ....a jeep cherokee comes flipping into frame, far off at the mouth of the alley, on the street. the jeep ends up landing right side up....hold.... .....barry flinches a little, stares.....the jeep sits idle for a moment....then it drives off....then: a speeding, small toyota comes into view at the mouth of the alley, screeching to a halt. the passenger side door opens and a small, wooden harmonium (like a portable organ) is placed on the ground. the toyota speeds away..... ....a moment or two later another non descript car flies past very fast.... beat. barry squints, looks at the small harmonium sitting alone in the middle of the street. he hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside his warehouse.}
