<L>__{exterior east wilmington high school short time later}
<A>__{randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the school, each step labored and painful. waiting near the entrance are two fans, both men in their 30s.}
<D>__{fan #1 yo, ram. think you could...?}
<A>__{fan #1 holds out a sharpie and an old wrestling program from the `80s. on the cover is a shot of randy wrestling corporal punishment, a heel in a drill instructor get up. randy takes the program, happy to oblige.}
<P>__{fan #1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{i was there.}
<A>__{randy hands back the program. fan #2 hands him a mini poster. the faded, mid '80s poster features randy, biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. across the top, it says "eat your vegetables, punk!"}
<D>__{fan #2}
<P>__{(as randy signs)}
<D>__{my first match ever was you versus davey diamond at the spectrum.}
<P>__{(nostalgic)}
<B>__{..}
<A>__{randy smiles a little. he remembers, too. he hands back the poster. fan #2 looks fondly at randy, a part of his boyhood.}
<P>__{fan #2 (cont'd) (vaguely sad)}
<D>__{you were awesome.}
<A>__{randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. the two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the delaware night. randy is left standing alone, still holding fan #1's pen. he walks over to a beat up old conversion van and climbs in. turns on the engine. music starts up on the stereo mid song. music: cinderella "don't know what you got (til it's gone)"}
