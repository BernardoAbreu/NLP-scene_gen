<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you know, when i only see one dog, i know i've had too much to drink. te family dog, skipper, sits near a ceramic dog table. maggie smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box and bag.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you'll never guess who came crawling into town with his tail between his legs.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{who? maggie enters the parlor to see ike smiling evilly from his seat on the couch.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(innocently)}
<A>__{hello, maggie. i just came by to apologize to your family.}
<P>__{(looks to walter)}

<A>__{you've got to be kidding me. maggie stares at them both.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(enjoying the moment)}
<A>__{no, no, you should have seen skipper.}
<P>__{(then, imitates growling)}
<A>__{it wasn't that funny. maggie gives him a look that says, "you are not absolved." she smiles stiffly, looking back at ike. she then sits on the arm of bob's chair and puts her arm on his shoulder.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{so, the forces of good and evil have already met. maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to walter. she snaps a look to bob, who follows her.}

<A>__{gee, i hope they don't have a fight out there. you don't think they'll call it off...?}
<C>__{walter}

<C>__{grandma julia}
<A>__{sorry.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{that's okay, grandma. grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from ike's sleeve.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(continuing his thought)}
<A>__{... like such a lovely girl. walter points to a portrait painting on the wall.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{like her mother.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(seeing the portrait)}
<A>__{ah, beautiful.}
<P>__{(gets up to admire the portrait)}
<A>__{i just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.}
<C>__{grandma julia}
<A>__{oh, yes, you can. she's has 'em all on tape.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{she has a tape?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(good natured)}

<C>__{ike}
<A>__{dad's fishing trip, grandma's knee operation, grandma's birthday...}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{gotta tell you this about my daughter. my daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels. maggie may not be hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest. walter cracks up.}
<C>__{grandma julia}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<A>__{ha ha. close on: a tape. it reads: "maggie i, ii, iii." ike's interest is more than piqued. ike picks it up. they get up and go to the dining room.}
