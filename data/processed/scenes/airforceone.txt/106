<A>__{no time for remorse. marshall tries the main conference room door. locked. he knows the others will be coming so he flattens himself against the corridor wall. trains his gun on the stairs. just as the terrorists descend, marshall squeezes off a few rounds. the terrorists edge back up the steps, returning fire. marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. he fires off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some gauze. the terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the stairs to take position. marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made molatov cocktail and throws it down the corridor. the bottle crashes into a ball of flame. catching bazylev on fire. he yells, drops and rolls. fire suppressing foam immediately sprays down from overhead.}
