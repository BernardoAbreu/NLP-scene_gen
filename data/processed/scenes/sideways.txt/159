<L>__{interior a.j. spurs barbecue night}
<A>__{miles and jack are finishing their salads in the rustic themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what i'm thinking?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm thinking it's time to settle down. one woman. one house. you know. it's time.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{jack nods his head with no self awareness or acknowledgment of the irony.}
<B>__{now two plates arrive}
<A>__{mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter whipped mashed potatoes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mm. mm.}
<A>__{their cheery, saftig blonde waitress removes several foil packets from her apron and places them on the table.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{and here're your handi wipes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, so that's what those are? for a second there i thought you guys were promoting safe sex.}
<A>__{the waitress over laughs and swipes a hand at her naughty customer.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i will be right back with more corn bread.}
<A>__{jack watches her go and leans in close to miles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i bet you that chick is two tons of fun. you know, the grateful type.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. i wouldn't know.}
<A>__{now she comes back toward the table carrying a big basket. beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons sh sh sh as she walks. when she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket using big tongs. jack watches attentively.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice technique there...}
<P>__{(checking her name tag)}
<D>__{...cammi.}
<C>__{cammi}
<D>__{it's all in the wrist.}
<P>__{(a moment later)}
<D>__{you know, you look really familiar. you from around here? where'd you go to high school?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, we're from san diego. why?}
<C>__{cammi}
<D>__{i don't know. you just seem really familiar to me. never mind. enjoy your meals.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hang on. did you ever know a derek sommersby?}
<C>__{cammi}
<D>__{doctor derek sommersby? you mean from "one life to live"?}
<A>__{miles looks away and sighs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair.}
<A>__{as cammi stares at jack, her face transforms in astonishment.}
<C>__{cammi}
<D>__{no. way. no way!}
<A>__{jack smiles and nods.}
<C>__{cammi}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{could you tell me where the bathroom is?}
<C>__{cammi}
<P>__{(her eyes barely leaving jack)}
<D>__{uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo.}
<A>__{in a wide shot miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as jack's flirtation with cammi continues. the camera pans with miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word "men." later a toothpick dispenser as a finger tips it forward to dispense one. wider miles stands by the cash register and picks his teeth as he watches jack finish speaking with cammi and head his way.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she gets off in an hour, so i think i'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're joking, right?}
<P>__{(seeing that he isn't)}
<D>__{what are you doing? un fucking believeable. can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?}
<A>__{jack rests one hand on miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, miles. i know you're my friend and you care about me. and i know you disapprove. i respect that. but there are some things i have to do that you don't understand. you understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight. and that's okay.}
<A>__{close on miles as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.}
