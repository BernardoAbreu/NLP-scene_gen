<L>__{interior dining room, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{parrish, joe, susan, allison and quince are seated at the table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside. allison and susan's eyes are on parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again. parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks over his demi tasse cup at joe, parrish aware of joe's heightened interest in susan, and susan's reciprocation. coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with cakes on them, luisa follows with one other. they set them down in front of parrish.}
