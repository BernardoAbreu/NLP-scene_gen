<L>__{interior a jazz record store. late afternoon.}
<A>__{this record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and stuffed with the trendiest romans, all of whom rifle the stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke. there are two listening booths, one of which has freddie and dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones. ripley stands outside the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant, while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly. he looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading. dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the accordion doors.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{look, tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of freddie's. the best thing is if you want to be a tourist grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(absolutely crestfallen)}
<D>__{what club?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum...?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i did. and then maybe get the jacket and what have you...}
<C>__{freddie}
<P>__{(from inside the booth)}
<D>__{dick you've got to hear this!}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(oblivious to ripley's pain)}
<D>__{listen, just take one of mine when we get back. don't worry about it. i did the forum with marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.}
<A>__{ripley hands him the coats, turns away.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{ciao. have fun.}
<A>__{ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the booth. dickie pushes it open.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you said to make sure you didn't miss the train. it leaves at eight.}
