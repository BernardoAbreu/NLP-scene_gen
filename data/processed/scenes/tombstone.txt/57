<L>__{int dressing room bedroom, wyatt's house night}
<A>__{mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while wyatt finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his face, looking in the cabinet for a towel. opening the bottom drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor. laudanum bottles, all empty. mattie looks up as wyatt comes out, bottle in hand:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{mattie. what about this?}
<C>__{mattie}
<P>__{(looks up, keeps ironing)}
<D>__{i need it.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{'least you admit it.}

<D>__{you know nothing. what you don't know would fill a book. jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most. you're never yourself, you never relax. never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself. oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh. but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt. i get so cold.}

<D>__{all right, look. i can make it right, i can make this up to you, mattie. i can, i swear.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she's nothing to you? right out loud so i can hear? tell her she's nothing, tell her she's nobody, just dirt? will you do that?}
<A>__{wyatt falls silent. mattie stands, staring at him a moment, then:}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{until you can do that we've got nothing to talk about, wyatt. nothing. now leave me alone.}
<A>__{she keeps ironing. wyatt looks as if a building fell on him....}
