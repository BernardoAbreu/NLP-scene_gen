<L>__{exterior desert road later day}
<A>__{bobby, holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped bleeding, hauling his bag on his shoulder, walks back to town along the side of the road. already he is caked with a mixture of sweat and dust, looking up at the relentless sun that beats down on him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fuckin' shithole!}
<A>__{a cadillac slows beside him, jake driving.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the fuck do you want?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i will give you a lift, son. too hot to be walking... people die out here, y'know.}
<A>__{bobby continues walking.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{aw, you're not still upset about that love tap, are you? if i meant you real trouble, i'd have given it to you by now. get in, lad. come on. get in.}
<A>__{bobby gets in.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{after you huffed off, grace lied so bad, i got so pissed off, i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger fucked it instead. sorry i lost my cool like that. it's a funny thing, women.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{say, what happened to your hand?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{accident.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you've got to be }
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, i know. more careful.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i guess we've never been introduced proper. jake mckenna.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's a solid name.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm a solid man.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{bobby cooper.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{"bobby cooper." what brings you to superior, coop?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{an overheated car.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh? darrell taking good care of you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{darrell's a moron.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{yeah, he sure is a character. you need any help with that car now?... where you headed?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{california...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{live there?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{got work. i know a man who's got a boat. wants me to sail it for him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you a sailor man? that'd be the life. drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. a man could pretty well disappear like that. just sail away until all he was was a memory. i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i hope so. (beat) listen, mckenna about your wife: if i had known she was married }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it? not a wit. do you know why? because you're a man without scruples.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wait a second }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ah, i can smell it on you.}
<A>__{jake wipes his hand across the back of bobby's neck and holds it to his nose.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. don't be offended, lad. a man who's got no ethics is a free man. i envy that. beside, how can i blame you? that grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? eh?}
<A>__{jake nudges bobby who smiles a nervous smile.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{she does at that. i knew when i married her she was a free spirit. a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. so, i married her. what are you to do, eh? women.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.}
<A>__{jake looks at bobby, his lips curled into a sly smile.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{"you can't shoot 'em!" i like that.}
<P>__{(laughs) i bet she led you on good, didn't}
<D>__{she? taking you up to the house to hang drapes. oh that's a good one. bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face. i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. then me busting in like some wild bear. ha! bet you had a fire going under you.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{like you don't know.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{mad like a dog in heat, i bet you were. i can tell you got a temper on you.}
<A>__{bobby gives a little laugh.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{bet you just wanted to snap her neck right then, didn't you? bet you just wanted to kill her.}
<A>__{bobby starts to laugh heartily. jake joins in, then stops abruptly.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{would you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{would i what?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{would you kill her?}
<A>__{bobby starts to laugh. bobby stops laughing.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{because i'm sick and tired of her little games. because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. because i've got a fifty thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.}
<A>__{for a moment bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of the offer.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i've done a few things but i'm not a murderer, mr. mckenna.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how do you know if you've never tried?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{this is a joke, right? you just want to rattle me. right?}
<A>__{they reach town and jake stops the car near a small grocery}
<B>__{store.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's right. nothing but a joke. that's all.}
<A>__{bobby gets out of the car. with a big smile jake says:}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{enjoy your stay, lad.}
<A>__{jake speeds away. bobby looks after him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who are these people?}
