<L>__{exterior 1486 evergreen bud night}
<A>__{steps to the house. inside, we hear slaps, muffled cries. bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and yanks. the sleigh crashes to the ground with reindeer exploding around it. a beat. the fat guy runs out to investigate, trips over rudolph. bud pounces. fat guy takes a swing, misses. grabbing fat guy's hair, bud smashes his face to the pavement. once, twice. teeth skitter down the walk.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{touch her again and i will know about it. understand? huh?}
<A>__{another face full of gravel. fat guy's wife watches with apprehension from the steps as bud cuffs her husband's hands behind his back, empties his pockets. a cash roll and car keys. bud looks over at her.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you got someplace you can go?}
<A>__{she nods. bud hands her the keys and the cash.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{go get yourself fixed up.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(nods, determined)}
<D>__{merry christmas, huh?}
<A>__{bud watches as she gets into a pre war ford in the drive. she backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.}
<C>__{stensland}
<D>__{you and women, partner. what's next? kids and dogs?}
