<A>__{paul lies awake, watching jan sleep. he looks troubled not to mention feverish. it occurs to him how badly he has to pee. he sits up, clutching at a queasy stab of pain in his groin...}

<A>__{...and comes hurrying down the steps, clutching himself...}
<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{...and he's moving even faster as he exits the kitchen, racing for the outhouse. he realizes he's not going to make it, stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the house... ...and as he does, he's hit with the most stunning pain of his life. he buckles to his knees it's only his flailing hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face first into his own piss. he crams his other hand to his mouth in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife. he manages to ride it out until his bladder empties. he falls onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the sky with both hands pressed to his groin.}
