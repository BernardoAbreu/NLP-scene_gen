<A>__{the sound of a tumbler tripping and, suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling willie with his stethoscope in his ears. in the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio. willie reaches in. willie grabs the folio and flips through it. insurance forms, deeds, social security cards, birth certificates, etc., all bear the name of the kid's father, roger merman. nothing of value. he puts the folio back, grabs the cash.}
