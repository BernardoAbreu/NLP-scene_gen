<L>__{exterior sherwood forest day}
<A>__{the sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest. from the other side of the flaming trees, little john's men pick off shots with their longbows. they retreat, turn and fire again. they back into a clearing... the celtic mercenaries charge at them across the open ground. the woodsmen drop their bows. hand to hand combat. woodsmen are being decimated. little john storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy, inspiring his men. the scotsmen are awed by this giant. tuck is confronted by a wild eyed celt.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{surely you would not harm a man of the cloth?}
<A>__{the man swings, tuck sidesteps.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{you would? then to hellfire with you.}
<A>__{he pummels the man to the ground with his staff. the woodsmen are broken into two groups. one group, including will, is surrounded and surrenders. the others fight on. bleeding from several wounds, little john is surrounded by four celts. he spins, challenging them, spitting out expletives. defiant to the last... suddenly his attackers are hurled aside. robin rides right through them, slashing with his sword.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{'bout bleedin' time, mush.}
<A>__{tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver ing the lethal blow, when aslan cuts him down. tuck glances heavenwards.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{thank you, lord.}
<P>__{(an afterthought)}
<D>__{and thank you, allah.}
<A>__{aslan is a wild man. steering his horse with just legs and knees, he strikes out with both swords to left and right. the momentum is turning. wulf appears at the edge of the clearing. starts picking off stragglers. his father spots him.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger.}
<A>__{distracted, he doesn't see a celt swing at his back... but wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. he freezes in mid air, before toppling at john's feet. when john turns back, wulf is being dragged away by three of the sherrif's men. he attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more celts... and struck down. aslan charges between the two celts. slashes down with both swords. both men topple to the ground simultaneously. suddenly all is quiet. the smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. only four men seem to be alive. robin, aslan, tuck, who is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. robin dismounts and runs to little john. overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit.}
<A>__{robin manages a relieved smile. aslan strides over. all around them lie slain celts and woodsmen.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{it was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign.}
