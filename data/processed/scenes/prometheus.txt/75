<L>__{interior magellan laboratory night}
<A>__{holloway stands studying the data displays: cross sections of the engineer's skull. watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the plastic tank. not a pretty sight. as she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one gossamer eyelid. the revealed eye is black as obsidian, iridescent like opal. a jewel. fascinated, watts pulls out a plastic case. opens it to reveal a high tech control unit with a screen. she pops open a plastic capsule: removes a tiny seed probe, smaller than a grain of rice. drops it into the vat. under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck. burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain. on a screen: in the probe's pov the medulla looks like a tunnel. the probe climbs along neural channels. another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull. glasse enters. stands beside holloway to watch watts at work.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{you won't get anything. tissue's too degraded. hmm. brain chamber's massive, even proportionately.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{neural paths are still conductive.}
<A>__{the seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye and its pov fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. an angel. glasse and holloway gasp. the woman in the blurry vision is watts as seen by the dead engineer's eye.}
<C>__{glasse}
<D>__{incredible.}
<A>__{the image dissolves into noise. error messages flicker across the display. watts sighs.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{formaldehyde's killing the tissue.}
<A>__{holloway stares at watts, awe on his face.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{did you record that?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{of course.}
<B>__{at a lab table}
<A>__{watts dissects one of the engineer's eyes working underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. glasse looks on avidly, an unabashed fan. watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead the lenses lowering and rising at need. she bisects the apple sized eyeball carefully and extracts the hard lens from behind the cornea. holds the lens up to her eye. it is opalescent, almost luminous.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{the lens is where the phase shift happens.}
<A>__{the uncorrected view through the lens is blurry.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{glasse. i want to look through these lenses. can you seal them and do the optical correction?}
<A>__{glasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from watts's forehead. he grins.}
<C>__{glasse}
<D>__{got an idea about that.}
