<A>__{as book and carter explode through the door of the bar, violently propelling coalmine along with them. now we see coalmine is not the killer. as book and carter escort coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into book's car. an alarmed rachel holds samuel close as book forces coalmine's face down next to the car window.}

<C>__{book}
<P>__{(continuing; to samuel)}
<D>__{look at him.}
<A>__{crazy as rasputin on speed and booze, coalmine glares at samuel inside the car: samuel, white faced, finally shakes his head in the negative. coalmine tries to twist free of book's grip. book snaps, and slams coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing his face up against the front window. his face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass. carter restrains his partner and book cools down. coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police. this sudden show of violence has horrified and angered rachel, and she glares at book as he gets back in the car.}
