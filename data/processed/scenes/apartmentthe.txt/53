<A>__{it is a gloomy december morning, and hundreds of desk bound employees are bent over their paper work. bud baxter, in raincoat and hat, is clearing out his desk. he has piled everything on his blotter pad reference books, papers, a fountain pen set, pencils, paper clips and the calendar. watching him from the next desk is a dumbfounded moffett. bud picks up the blotter pad with his stuff on it, and as he moves past moffett's desk, moffett takes out a dollar bill, drops it grudgingly on the loaded pad. bud flashes him a little grin, continues between the desks toward the row of glass enclosed offices housing the supervisory personnel. he comes up to an unoccupied cubicle. a sign painter is brushing in some new lettering on the glass door it reads c. c. baxter, second administrative assistant. bud studies the sign with a good deal of satisfaction.}
