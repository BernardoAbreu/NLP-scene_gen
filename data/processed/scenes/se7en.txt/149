<L>__{interior coffee cafe morning}
<A>__{somerset and tracy are seated in a booth by the window. the city's morning rush passes by outside. the cafe is noisy. tracy is very upset. somerset is very uneasy.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{david doesn't know about this? you haven't told him?}
<A>__{tracy shakes her head. somerset sighs. long silence.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{i have to tell you, tracy, i'm not the one to talk to about this.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i just can't think straight. i don't know why i called you, except i can't stand to hold it as a secret anymore. i had to get it out... and i can't tell david yet. not yet.}
<A>__{somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and puts them away. he watches tracy stir her coffee.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i... i had a relationship once, very much like a marriage. and, there was a baby. a long time ago. things were good. and i got up one morning, and i went on a case... a murder, like any other. except it was my first since hearing about the baby. and, i felt this fear and anxiety coming over me. i looked around and i thought, how can i raise a child here? so, that night, i told her i didn't want us to have children, and, over the next few weeks... i convinced her...}
<A>__{tears come to somerset's eyes.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{i mean, i wore her down... slowly.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i want to have children. but...}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i can tell you, i know... i'm positive i made the right decision. i'm positive it was the right thing to do. but, there's never a day that goes by that i don't wish i had decided differently.}
<A>__{tracy reaches to hold somerset's hand, but he withdraws it, wipes his tears away.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{if you... if you decide not to have the baby... if that's what you decide, then never tell mills you were pregnant. i mean that. never tell.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{your marriage would just wither, and die altogether.}
<A>__{tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{but, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him. tell him that exact second. and, spoil that kid every chance you get.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{somerset...}
<A>__{somerset stands. he forces a smile.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{that's all the wisdom i can share with you, tracy. i barely know you.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{will i see you again, before you leave?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{probably not. but, it's probably better that way.}
<A>__{somerset steps away, leaves. tracy watches him go.}
