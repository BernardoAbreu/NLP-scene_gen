<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i don't know why, but for some odd reason, i feel absolutely compelled to tell you the truth about this... even at the risk of }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hey, you're giving me the creeps. just spit it out.}
<A>__{wills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says it }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i never had a date for the benefit. my plan from the beginning was for you to come with me.}
<A>__{charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{so i made the hat for myself?}
<P>__{(he nods.)}
<D>__{and you bought that dress for me?}
<P>__{(he nods.)}
<D>__{and you did all this just so you could sleep with me?}
<P>__{(he nods.)}
<D>__{why? i mean, why me?}
<A>__{wills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the eulogy you gave at ella's service was so... impressive. you spoke about her death... about loss... in a way that i could never have done. you understood life emotionally in a way that i didn't. whatever that understanding was, i wanted to get close to it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{and sex seemed like the best way to do it.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and the most enjoyable, yeah.}
<A>__{charlotte sips her wine and considers. then she sets down her glass }

<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{and, second, don't ever lie to me again.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{seriously. there isn't a lie in the whole world i'd rather hear than the truth.}
<A>__{wills stares at her solemnly. her expression just as somber, she lifts a hand and points to her lips. he leans forward to kiss her.}
