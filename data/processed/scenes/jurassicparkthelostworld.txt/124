<L>__{exterior main street night}
<A>__{nick drags a badly limping malcolm down the main street. they can see helicopter at the far end, engine roaring and searchlight playing over them as they draw closer. they approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the street and a raptor leaps on top of it. its claws clack on the roof as it goes into its pre attack crouch. they don't stick around to negotiate. nick hauls malcolm off into the nearest building.}
