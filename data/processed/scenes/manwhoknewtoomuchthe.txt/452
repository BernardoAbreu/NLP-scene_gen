<A>__{standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an oil painting of the prime minister, is the ambassador whom we saw at the albert hall. he is on the telephone.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{yes...yes...i see. well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, i suppose. all right.}
<L>__{interior embassy (night) med. close shot}
<A>__{mrs. drayton closes the door behind the two as drayton advances towards the ambassador with an easy manner, the camera panning him.}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{excuse me sir, i have a lot to explain to you something very unusual has happened. i must also have the money to pay our french marksman.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(almost casually)}
<D>__{wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?}
<A>__{drayton and his wife stare mutely at the ambassador. they are staggered at this news.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{his aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. the target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. worse than useless.}
<A>__{drayton still stares, petrified, at the ambassador.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{then your french friend panicked, and made a fatal crash landing on the floor of the albert hall.}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(blustering weakly)}
<D>__{i don't see how you can hold me responsible. he was most warmly recommended by our people in marrakesh...}
<A>__{the ambassador now begins to get really nasty.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{i'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. i am holding a reception here this evening. in a few minutes, i have to welcome our prime minister as my guest of honor when i hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. that amuses you, no doubt?}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(feebly)}
<D>__{i don't know what to say ...}
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(brutally)}
<D>__{no. but i do. you've muddled everything from the start. kidnapping that child in marrakesh...don't you realize that americans dislike having their children kidnapped?}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(trying to keep his end up)}
<D>__{how else could i make sure the american would hold his tongue?}
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(ignoring this)}
<D>__{and then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide and bring the child with you: don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this embassy?}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i didn't think...i only thought...}
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(staccato)}
<D>__{how are you going to get the child out of here, eh? eh? eh? eh?}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(struggling for self confidence)}
<D>__{there's no difficulty about that, surely? the car }
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{with plain clothes detectives planted right round this building?}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{you english intellectuals will be the death of us all.}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{i will think of some method. just give me time....}
<C>__{ambassador}
<P>__{(he snorts contemptuously)}
<D>__{time!}
<A>__{the ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage, and then he stops and looks at drayton as if thinking about something.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{i want the child removed from this embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.}
<C>__{mrs. drayton}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{the ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks. she tries to say something, but no words come out of her half open mouth. drayton, however, answers the ambassador with horrible servility.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{right, i will see to it..}
<A>__{lucy drayton looks at her husband with loathing. there is a polite tap on the door. the ambassador looks up.}
<C>__{ambassador}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens and a butler enters.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{your excellency, the princess should be arriving at any moment.}
<A>__{the ambassador braces himself, his chest swells out a little, h assumes a set smile and strides from the room. just at this moment we hear a string orchestra in the distance strike up some gay waltz music. the ambassador goes out of the door. mrs. drayton is looking down at the floor.}
