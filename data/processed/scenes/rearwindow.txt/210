<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi long shot}
<A>__{shooting towards the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer. the second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. this newcomer is police detective lieutenant thomas j. doyle, the man jeff phoned earlier in the day. he is an intelligent appearing, well dressed modern detective. he has a sense of humor. he lowers the glasses, and turns to jeff.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you didn't see the killing, or the body? how do you know there was a murder?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{because everything that man's done has been suspicious. trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i will admit it all has a mysterious sound but is could mean a number of different things. murder is the least likely.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{go ahead, doyle tell me he's an unemployed magician amusing the neighborhood with sleight of hand.}
<A>__{doyle paces a little.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{it's too stupid and obvious a way to murder in full view of fifty windows and then sit over there }
<P>__{(he points)}
<D>__{ smoking a cigar waiting for the police to pick him up.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well, officer do your duty.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you've got a lot to lean about homicide, jeff. morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i will bet it's been done.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{almost everything's been done under panic. but this is a thousand to one shot. that man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{you think i made all this up?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i think you saw something that probably has a very simple explanation.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{for instance?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{his wife took a trip.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{she was an invalid!}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you told me.}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{i've got to run, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{all right you don't believe me.}
<A>__{doyle saunters toward steps, picking up his hat on the way. stops.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i uh won't report it to the department. let me poke into a little on my own. no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{we know the wife is gone. i will see if i can find out where.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{do that.}
<A>__{he goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat. he pauses his hand on the door knob.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you have any headaches lately?}
