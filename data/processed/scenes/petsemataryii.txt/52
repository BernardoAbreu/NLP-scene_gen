<L>__{exterior the bog day}
<A>__{geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall... beyond is a dark swamp, a bog, looking unlike anything one would expect in maine. tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation that looks almost prehistoric. gnarled trees rise up from the murky earth, blocking the sun from view. geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with drew. somewhere off in the distance we hear an unearthly sound. not a bird. not any animal known to man. spectral shapes flicker at the edge of geoff's vision, sinking back into the shadows as geoff tries to focus on them.}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{drew, where are we going?}
<A>__{drew doesn't respond. he continues on without another word, hell bent on finding this "better place." further along day at the boundary of the bog, a stairway of huge, wide stones rises from the blanket of ground fog. bordered by fir trees. leading up the hillside. the final leg of drew and geoff's journey.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this is it... i wasn't sure if it even really existed.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{what did?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{the old indian burial ground.}
<A>__{geoff's eyes move to the stairway of stones.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{come on, that's just a bullshit story. you said so yourself...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what if it's not bullshit? if i bury zowie there, and it works...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...he'll come back alive.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{drew, i know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?}
<A>__{geoff feels for drew. it's pointless to reason. drew starts up the stone steps. geoff has no choice but to follow.}
