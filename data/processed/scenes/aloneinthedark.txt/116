<L>__{exterior mine}
<A>__{burke leads carnby, aline, and miles to the entrance hall.}
<P>__{burke (into comm link)}
<D>__{no. initiate nine alpha on my authority. but i won't hold my breath. by the time this clears defense council, we'll be dead or drinking...}
<L>__{interior mine entrance hall night 135}
<A>__{rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie discarded throughout the hall. several shafts have been dug into the mountain. narrow paths lead up the slope. agents scurry around, setting up the defense system. the main position is set up just inside the entrance to the hall. burke and miles enter, followed by aline and carnby.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{we've got three perimeters of flash mines. gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. and every available agent in the vicinity is here. but commander...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i know, miles. but back up won't make it before sunrise.}
<A>__{several raised platforms stand in the middle of the hall. on one platform, agent turner helps two agents unload a large gold plated generator from the back of a humvee.}
<C>__{agent turner}
<D>__{generator will be on line shortly, sir.}
<A>__{burke nods to turner as he and the others walk by. carnby and aline get into step with burke and miles.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{it looks like you're going to war.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{we are. the highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. this could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all.}
<A>__{a tunnel, carved directly into the rock wall of the mine, leads off into darkness. carnby stares down at the tunnel.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{we need to go down there.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{they're coming here for a reason. until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them.}
<A>__{agent miles consults his hand held para meter.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{something's definitely down there, sir. but there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here.}
<A>__{miles looks at burke expectantly. carnby and aline watch him as well. burke looks conflicted.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{goddamn it. miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there.}
