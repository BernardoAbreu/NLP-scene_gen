<A>__{karen steps inside. moving boxes are stacked against the wall, next to a desk. it's an unfinished room. she listens. no scratching. nothing unusual here. except karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty shelf. it's a black ceramic cat. facing the wall. strange. and then karen hears the scratching sound again.}

<A>__{karen steps into the hallway and listens. there it is again, and this time there's no doubt the sounds are coming from the room by the stairs. karen walks to the door. she pauses, disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside. then she reaches for the doorknob. thud. thud. karen hesitates. the strange rhythmic thudding continues, coming from beyond the door.}
