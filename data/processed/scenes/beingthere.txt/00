<L>__{exterior townhouse garden washington, d.c. afternoon}
<A>__{an afternoon in late november, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches. the garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall. at one end stands the rear of a three story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building. classical music is heard in the distance. a man, handsomely dressed in a well tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden. a gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. he works slowly, precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings. this man is called chance. chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time. he looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket. as chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork.}
