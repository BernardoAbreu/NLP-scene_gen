<A>__{ivan 2 helps petra off the motorboat. they look down at the water, but there's no sign of xander. gibbons and his men push through the cordon of police, scanning the water. nothing. tears well in petra's eyes. even gibbons looks dejected. then petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream. there's a boat ramp leading into the water. at first they see a ripple, then the top of a shaved head emerges. the whole crowd looks on as xander rises from the water, walking up the boat ramp. his shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. but there's a look on his face, a calm, a self confidence we haven't seen before. the phoenix has risen. petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. xander shakes ivan 2's hand and then turns to gibbons.}
