<C>__{linga}
<D>__{how can we trust them?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{we can't.}
<P>__{(heading back in)}
<D>__{this is what madiba wants, okay.}
<A>__{not okay for linga, judging by the expression on his face.}
<L>__{interior security office day}
<A>__{when jason and linga enter, etienne looks up from mandela's schedule.}
<C>__{etienne}
<D>__{are there any special orders or conditions?}

<D>__{yes, seriously. it's the new south africa.}
<C>__{etienne}

<A>__{jason lifts the schedule.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{let's get through this.}
<A>__{still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over etienne's, at the month's schedule. apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office. both teams study and discuss the schedule (shop talk tbd use this to give us a quick glimpse of a day week month in the life of m.) etienne shakes his head.}

<C>__{jason}
<D>__{i don't care about the game. i care that the president'll be so exposed.}
