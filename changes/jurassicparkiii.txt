Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing water, intently watching for Enrique's signal. As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer. Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and Eric braces themselves. Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat, hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR." THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel. BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher. ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain height, he LOCKS OFF the reel. High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant. Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs. As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him. And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line, pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites through the line.}
