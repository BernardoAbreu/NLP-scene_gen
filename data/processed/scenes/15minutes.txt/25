<L>__{interior milos' apartment dawn}
<A>__{camera descends from the sky picking up jordy as he enters what is left of milos and tamina's apartment. the roof has been burned off. he moves into the next room, trying to see through the darkness looking through the muck and char.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{okay to smoke?}
<A>__{jordy turns, surprised. eddie sits on a singed chair. he pours from a half pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton soup' container, smoking a cigar. on the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{it's your crime scene now. you can do what you want.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{watch the news?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{nah, i musta missed it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, just so you know. i gave you guys the credit.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{well, just so you know, i don't care about that stuff.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{nah, why should you?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{i don't even watch tv.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{good. good. commendable.}
<A>__{eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{did you get a report from the m.e.?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{sure. but i would like to ask you something. you got a problem with me?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{if you found me steppin' on your crime scene it might piss you off, too.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what about the report?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you were right, they were both dead before the fire. the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. that's usually an indicator of something personal.}
<A>__{jordy pulls out a sketch of daphne. hands it to eddie.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{pretty.}
<C>__{jordy}
<P>__{(acts as if he didn't notice)}
<D>__{hmmmm.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{maybe you don't care about that either.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{prettiest suspect i've had in awhile.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{who says she's a suspect?}
<A>__{jordy tries to take the sketch back. eddie holds on.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what would you call her?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{look, i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead. maybe she saw something. maybe she was visiting somebody here. who knows?}
<A>__{eddie walks up to the burnt mattress where the bodies were.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{obviously they weren't having sex. as you pointed out. so why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?}
<A>__{eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to jordy.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe. it could be to humiliate them. just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{eastern europe. like what? romania? hungary?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{or czechoslovakia. the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years. these are very intense people and they take things personally.}
<A>__{eddie's cellular rings he grabs it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah? where? you sure it was a knife? uh huh. really? okay.}
<P>__{(to jordy)}
<D>__{we've got another murder in a hotel on eighth avenue. a stabbing. clerk said the room was rented by a russian...}
<A>__{eddie's moving with daphne's sketch.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{i will come with you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{there wasn't a fire. there'll be nothing for you to do.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{i can watch you, eddie. maybe i will learn something.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{this isn't homicide school.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{my parents are from poland. i can help with the eastern european angle.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you're polish?}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{my folks are.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{stay here.}
