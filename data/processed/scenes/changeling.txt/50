<L>__{interior union station train platform day}
<A>__{we hear the same train whistle from this side as christine and jones come to the ramp, police chief davis is waiting. the reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{mrs. collins, i'd like to introduce you to chief of police james e. davis.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, my, i didn't expect }
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{we don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here when there's a positive story, don't you think?}
<A>__{changeling a true story but she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform, where the train is starting to pull in.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{i take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh...yes, of course, they've been great. well, there was that part about having to wait twenty four hours before filing a report, but }
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{technicalities aside }
<A>__{the train stops. doors begin to open.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yes...other than that, no complaints. they've all been wonderful.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{good, then you won't have any problem telling that to the press, and how the lapd is concerned first and foremost with the safety of }
<A>__{but she's already running down the platform as people start to step off the train. jones exchanges a look with davis.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{women. just a sec....}
<A>__{he trots off to catch up with christine, who walks alongside the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager. then: the matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her...but christine spots them. with jones not far behind, she breaks into a run.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{walter...walter!}
<A>__{she runs toward them. the matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy. christine stops. staggers so hard she almost falls. she steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. for a moment, we're not sure what's going through her mind. she looks to the matron, who smiles. looks to the boy, who smiles. then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as jones comes jauntily alongside her. changeling a true story}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{well? aren't you going to }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{he's not my son.}
<A>__{jones freezes at the words.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i...what are you }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{he's not my son.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's not my son.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i'm...i'm sure you're mistaken.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{mistaken?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{he's been through four long, terrible months...he's gone through changes, lost weight }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i know my own son.}
<A>__{he glances over his shoulder to where the chief of police is waiting, not aware of any of this, and beyond him...the press.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{i'm just saying...i mean, you're in shock, and he's changed, and }
<A>__{he turns from her, stoops down to look at the boy.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what's your name, son? can you tell me your name? "walter" walter collins.}
<A>__{christine steps back as though slapped. this can't be.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it's a common name, it }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{do you know where you live, walter? do you know your home address?}
<A>__{the boy considers for a moment...then: changeling a true story}
<D>__{"walter" my house is at 210 north avenue 23, los angeles, california.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and that's my mommy!}
<A>__{and he runs to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only magnifies her horror. jones has no idea what to make of her, or this, or the boy. the only thing he knows is that the chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion. the press is nearly insane trying to get through to them.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{mrs. collins...listen to me. i know you're feeling uncertain right now, but that's to be expected...a boy this age changes so fast...but we've compensated for that in our investigation. we're experts in child identification. there's no question that this is your son.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it's not walter.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{it's not walter as you remember him. that's why it's important for you to take him home, on a...trial basis.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{a trial basis?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{once you've put him back in familiar surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition...you'll see that it is him. i swear to you, mrs. collins. i give you my word. trust me...this is your son.}
<A>__{she looks from him to the boy...who is not terribly dissimilar from walter...so that even the audience may not be entirely sure if it's him or not...and part of her wants desperately to believe...the pressure is immense.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{if there's any problem, any problem at all, come and talk to me and i will take care of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mrs. collins...he has nowhere else to go.}
<A>__{changeling a true story it's an agonizing moment, then finally:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i...look, i will take him home, but only because i...might not be thinking clearly right now, and }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the chief of police approaches as the press rushes toward them. in an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement.}
<C>__{reporters}
<D>__{how does it feel to have your son home, mrs. collins? what did you think when you saw him for the first time?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it was...it's...hard to explain.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(jumping in)}
<D>__{it was certainly quite a shock. at first she hardly recognized him. perfectly natural, the boy's been through quite an ordeal.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{how're you feeling, son? bet it feels great to be home. "walter" yeah, it's great!}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{the los angeles police department is thankful for all the hard work done by the de kalb county sheriff's department in helping to make this joyful reunion possible. the lapd is dedicated to serving the public at all times, and }
<C>__{another reporter}
<D>__{can we get a photo of mother and son, captain?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i }
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{he poses christine and "walter" so she is holding the boy in her arms. dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for the cameras. bulbs flash and time slows down, the sound muted, as christine looks around at it all as though in a dream...reporters shouting questions she doesn't hear...bulbs flashing...the boy beside her, smiling at it all. he looks at her, mouths the word mommy, as }
