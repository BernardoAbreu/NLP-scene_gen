<L>__{interior the art treasure room}
<A>__{hawk and alex weave through the room which is crammed, with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures including an impressive array of faberge eggs. a solid gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...}
<C>__{hawk and alex}
<D>__{"just traveling along, singing a song. side "}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{geez, this place is a mess...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{voila...}
<A>__{they rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room covered by a small curtain that has the da vinci man in the circle drawing emblazoned across it. hawk reaches for the curtain. alex puts his arm around him and speaks, not sings.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{side by side, man...}
<A>__{suddenly, the roof above them explodes. kaplan and the candy bars drop down behind them.}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{what the hell....}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{you're supposed to be dead!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm a ghost. boo.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{i wish i could think of those cute quips the way you can, hawk, but i can't, so i will just shoot alex.}
<A>__{kaplan point blank shoots alex in the chest. alex crumples backward, moaning. butterfinger, casually, but with incredible strength, holds hawk's arms behind his back.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no....}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{that was pretty uncool, george...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{sorry, you know he kind of reminds me of little eddie. but i digress. ah, victory is so sweet....}
<A>__{kaplan pulls back the da vinci curtain. nothing is there.}
<B>__{the ballroom banquet}
<A>__{a soviet chef lifts up a silver domed serving tray, revealing the da vinci helicopter model.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{yum. this is the best meal i ever had...}

<A>__{bulges her eyes at the revelation. she pulls out alex's gun and bangs herself in the head. what to do....}
<B>__{the art treasures room}
<A>__{kaplan is bugging out.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{damnit, this isn't the plan! blue light, green light, shit! snickers, kit kat, a.j., scramble, see if you can find out anything.}
<A>__{they thunder out. hawk, still in butterfinger's oblivious clutches, shouts..}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{can't you see the mayflowers double crossed you...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{they may be scum, but if i get the da vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.}
<A>__{kaplan raises his gun.}
<B>__{the ballroom banquet}
<A>__{darwin holds the da vinci model in one hand and raises a glass of vodka in the other.}

<C>__{anna }
<D>__{stop or i will shoot.}
<A>__{minerva and some various soviet vips spew their vodka to look up to anna pointing a gun down at them from the second level. she is shivering, shaking the gun.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you people are immoral and narcissitic and i won't let you...}
<A>__{in unison, the soviet soldiers surrounding the table begin machine gunning up at her. she dives behind the railing.}
<B>__{the art treasures room}
<A>__{kaplan lowers his gun.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{i can't believe this. i'm in fucking russia, or do i have to say, the fucking soviet union and i'm shooting a non bolshevick.}
<P>__{(raising back up his gun)}
<D>__{i never thought i'd say "i'm just in this job for the money." sad. any last immature quips?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but why do you let butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?}
<A>__{falling for the oldest trick in the book, butterfinger looks down to his shirt.}
<C>__{butterfinger}
<D>__{what blood stains....}
<A>__{hawk bounces up to savagely head butt butterfinger. butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the gold sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the ground, pinning his head to the floor. the gold hammer next trembles off the wall and crushes butterfinger's skull.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you want immature, how 'bout an egg fight...}
<A>__{hawk flings a faberge egg, smashing the gun out of kaplan's hand. hawk pelts a batch more at him. kaplan sloppily whips some eggs back. hawk finally smashes one in half and beans the jagged piece into kaplan's eye. he squeals to the ground, geysering blood. hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling alex.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{alex, are you....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i can't believe you didn't notice. my weight. i lost ten pounds in rome}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you're a reed, man. i gotta get anna. hang in there...}
<B>__{the ballroom}
<A>__{bullets stop splintering around anna at the railing as the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload. snickers, almond joy, and kit kat race out of the hall way area into the ballroom area. they stop at the sight of anna....}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{anna bannana fo fanna, i guess i have to cut out your heart for real now. it's not personal.}
<A>__{anna feebly raises her gun. almond joy laughs and pulls out a knife.}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{you won't shoot. i read your dossier... sister.}
<A>__{the soviet soldiers snap in new cartridges as almond joy moves out from behind the pillar towards anna. the soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure. almond joy ruptures and vibrates in a sonny corleone ballet.}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{i gotta get a new job...}
<A>__{snickers and kit kat militarily roll on either side of anna as their partner wilts to the ground. the men, snickers with his mini uzi, kit kat with his cross bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers with some graphic success. anna watches darwin and minerva head up the stairs to her level. she bolts off....}
<B>__{ballroom floor}
<A>__{the last of the soviet vips flee as the soldiers tip over the m shaped table on its side, using it for cover, firing upward.}
<B>__{kit kat}
<A>__{breaks off and scurries around the second level to get a position behind the m. he fires down an arrow for a successful kill. another guard tries to fire up, but kit kat impales him to the back of the table with a quality shot. kit kat grins and reloads as alfred, the butler, regally creeps behind him.}
<B>__{hawk}
<A>__{comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where anna is bustling. they hug...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the mayflowers got...}
<A>__{hawk and anna turn to see the mayflowers hastening in their direction. noticing them back, the model toting mayflowers halt.}
<B>__{kit kat}
<A>__{turns to alfred and fires his crossbow. alfred effort lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues to move forward. still smiling, kit kat tries to reload.}
<B>__{minerva}
<A>__{breaks the standstill.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{what a pleasant surprise. you're probably wondering...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{but you're going to tell us anyway...}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i hate a man with a sense of humor. while you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{if you think you're getting past me...}
<A>__{grunting behind them, snickers gun butts hawk to the ground.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{don't be stupid...they...}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{bastard! if you were a true american.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{just shut up and hit me!}
<A>__{snickers swings a punch. hawk blocks it then whomps him in the chest. as they battle, darwin grabs anna's hair, slams her into a pillar, and watches her crumple.}
<B>__{kit kat}
<A>__{gets in an arrow but it's too late. alfred stabs him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground. a shower of cards reading "ouch" "pain" and "this really hurts" rain from out of kit kat's coat. alfred discards him over the edge. kit kat sails down upon the m. the lone card of "fuck" plops from his open eyed corpse.}
<B>__{hawk}
<A>__{and snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a staircase.}
<B>__{darwin}
<A>__{and minerva watch the fight with amusement. alfred approaches.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{alfred, the getaway car...}
<B>__{snickers}
<A>__{slashes hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{damnit, i hate this! i'm a cat burglar! nobody said anything about this fight to the death shit.}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{too bad.}
<A>__{snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head. hawk turns to see alex, barely standing, at the top of the stairs, holding the strange rifle. darwin and minerva turn to this dramatic entrance. they start to trot off...}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{i knew it! i told you it was a fake.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{that new york italian father made twenty bucks a week son of a bitch. what was our bet? a million?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{million five, lover...}
<B>__{hawk}
<A>__{boots snickers down the stairs. snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb. snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the m to watch.}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{help me you democratic reform lovers! get a screwdriver, you stupid eskimoes! screw dri ver! oh god, i always wanted to know how to play the harp, there just was so little time! rosebud!}
<A>__{the soldiers high tail it out. snickers plugs his ears. nothing happens.}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{maybe it was just a....}
<A>__{snickers blows up gloriously before the m.}
<B>__{the staircase}
<A>__{hawk bounds up to alex, who puffs down onto the steps.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{get 'em. they went down the hallway.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{let's just forget it, i mean...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{get em....}
<A>__{hawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a "what can i do?" glance to the unconscious anna, and then continues rushing, past a pillar. minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward.}
<B>__{the long enigmatic hallway}
<A>__{hawk chugs beneath the lenin mural and down the hall way. he sees darwin breezing in front of him. darwin looks back to hawk then runs forward into the darkness.}
<B>__{the ballroom}
<A>__{minera sits down next to the pained alex.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{alex. how's it going?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{go, go to hell, to hell.}
<A>__{minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{where's your insulin....no? well, bon appetite.}
<A>__{minerva savagely slams alex's head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth.}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one eyed and bleeding george kaplan dives out of the art treasures room and tackles him. hawk kicks him off...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh, come on....}
<B>__{the ballroom}
<A>__{alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{very good, alex, but you re still alive....}
<A>__{she pulls out another candy bar. alex, with a last burst of strength, punches her across the face.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{that's fair.}
<B>__{the long hallway}
<A>__{hawk and kaplan lock onto each other's throats.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{why does this have to be so hard...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{tell me about it...}
<A>__{suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the darkness. hawk and kaplan stop fighting and turn to see the may flower limousine screeching out of the darkness with darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun. bullets fly around them. from his back pocket, hawk slaps the nice picture of him and little eddie into kaplan's hands.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{take this to hell with you...}
<A>__{hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp. deranged with confusion, kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{my pension.....}
<A>__{the driving alfred smiles through the windshield. kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield. hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp. passing beneath, darwin raises up his gun. hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on darwin, locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into....}
<B>__{the backseat of the limousine}
<A>__{hawk and darwin grapple on the floor of the limo. the da vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat. darwin's gun goes off.. right through alfred's throat. he slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator.}
<B>__{the limousine}
<A>__{blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and bashing off paintings and mirrors.}
<B>__{the backseat}
<A>__{darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side of hawk's hand into its teeth.}
<B>__{outside the limousine}
<A>__{a mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall.}
