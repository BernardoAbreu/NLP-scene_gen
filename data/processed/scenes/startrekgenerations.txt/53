<A>__{riker is standing next to picard, who has his back turned and is staring out the window. picard seems distracted during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as riker finishes his report.}

<D>__{we found two dead romulans aboard the station. we're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from.}
<A>__{picard nods absently.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there's still no indication of why they attacked the station?}
<C>__{riker}

<C>__{riker}
<D>__{you want me to contact starfleet?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{is there a problem?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{thank you, number one.}
<A>__{picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. riker hesitates, awkward.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{there is something else, captain. one of the scientists. a doctor soran... has insisted on speaking with you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{understood. that will be all.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{sir... is there anything wrong?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no. thank you.}
<A>__{a beat, then riker turns and exits. off picard's unreadable face...}
