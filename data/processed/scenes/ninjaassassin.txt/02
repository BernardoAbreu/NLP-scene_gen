<L>__{interior tattoo parlor night}
<A>__{a place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying towels, tea and cigarettes. dozens of yakuza look on as the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos. hollywood, the young yakuza member, is getting his first tattoo, a relatively small one on his back. he grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{watch it, old man!}
<A>__{the old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush. maybe a little harder.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{what the fuck? you're doing it wrong.}
<C>__{tattoo artist}
<D>__{the needle is doing what the needle does.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{tattoo master}
<D>__{the irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the book of five rings: the warrior, the artist, the merchant, and the farmer. if there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what did you just say, old man?}
<A>__{hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old man's jaw.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{i know you didn't just disrespect me, did you? you that fucking stupid? you disrespect me, and i will tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains!}
<A>__{the old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through years of service to men like hollywood.}
<C>__{tattoo master}
<D>__{no disrespect.}
<A>__{hollywood smiles.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{you're lucky. i can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. gimme that mirror! how's it looking?}
<A>__{goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus. hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror. he whistles approval as yakuza one enters carrying an origami envelope.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{not bad. not bad. for an old fuck.}
<C>__{yakuza one}
<D>__{hey, boss. this just came for you.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{yakuza one}
<D>__{a letter.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{so open it, dumb ass.}
<A>__{he opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he sees.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{what? what is it?}
<A>__{he pours the contents out into his hand.}
<C>__{yakuza one}
<D>__{looks like sand.}
<A>__{he tastes it.}
<C>__{yakuza one }
<D>__{yup. sand. black sand.}
<A>__{the tattoo master drops his brush. it clatters to the floor.}
<C>__{tattoo master}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{you know what this is?}
<A>__{the artist barely nods.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{wanna let us in on the joke?}
<C>__{tattoo master}
<D>__{years ago, i watched a man open an envelope like that one.}
<A>__{his eyes pool with fury at the memory.}
<C>__{tattoo master }
<D>__{there were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now. then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood. you cannot bargain with what is coming. you cannot reason with it. because it is not a human being. it is a demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are dead.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what came out of the shadows?}
<C>__{tattoo master}
<D>__{i cannot say the word.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what word?}
<A>__{he pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful tattoo of a shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump of scar tissue at the center of his heart.}
<C>__{tattoo artist}
<D>__{that night, one of their blades struck here. i should have died, but for an accident of birth. my heart is here, on the other side.}
<A>__{hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?}
<C>__{yakuza one}
<D>__{looks like a ninja, boss.}
<C>__{hollywood}
<D>__{a ninja? are you kidding me? that's the word you're afraid to say? ninja?}
<A>__{as he starts to laugh.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{ninja ninja ninja!}
<A>__{his laughter is infectious.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{you old fuck! you had me going! ninja. that's some good shit.}
<A>__{his lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his tongue wagging in space. lights shatter around the room. chaos ensues. the panicked screams of the fleeing entourage co mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles of hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are eviscerated. there's a rush of movement, more felt than seen. the whistle of swords through the air. cries and screams. guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled. stay on the face of the tattoo master, barely visible in the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window. frozen. immobile. as the killing continues around him. then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate breathing, and a match being struck by hollywood who looks up and sees a dark figures standing before him. everyone else is dead. only he and the tattoo master remain. the figure regards him with still silence. for perhaps the first time in his life, hollywood is terrified.}
<C>__{hollywood }
<D>__{listen... you don't have to do this! whatever you're getting paid, i will triple it! you hear me! i will pay you whatever you want! just name your price!}
<A>__{their answer is silence. hollywood sees his guns nearby. with a desperate scream, he throws the match in the air as he dives for his guns, grabbing one in each hand. there is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed hands are tumbling gracefully through the air. the blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it were barely there, coming out the other side as hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces, splattering the artist with blood. the match touches the floor and goes out. the tattoo master does not move, has not moved. frozen.}
<C>__{tattoo artist}
<D>__{but you are real, aren't you?}
<A>__{after a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the dark to inspect its kill. the artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart pounding in his ears.}
<C>__{tattoo artist }
<D>__{for fifty seven years, i've told your story...}
<C>__{tattoo artist }
<D>__{no one ever believed me.}
<A>__{the ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless. he crouches down, his eyes taking in the old man's tattoo.}
<C>__{tattoo artist }
<D>__{but you are real, aren't you?}
<A>__{there's the shing of a sword being unsheathed. the artist closes his eyes, anticipating death. silence. he waits for the death blow. it does not come. he finally forces himself to open his eyes. the ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he came, leaving death and blood in his wake.}
