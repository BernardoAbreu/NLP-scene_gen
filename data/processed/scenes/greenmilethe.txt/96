<L>__{interior e block day}
<A>__{...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for del's return. percy actually looks happy for a change, feeling genuinely accepted for the first time... billy is watching from his cell. just watching. the door opens. del returns with mr. jingles on his shoulder, escorted by brutal. brutal is toting the cigar box and spool like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{they love mr. jingles! they laugh and cheer and clap they hands!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{well, that's just aces. pop back in your cell, old timer.}
<A>__{the generosity of percy's tone catches del completely off guard. del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust... ...and the old percy comes back. he bares his teeth in a mock snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab del. it's a joke, but del doesn't know that he jerks back in fear and trips over brutal's big feet. del goes down hard, hitting the linoleum with the back of his head. mr. jingles jumps clear, goes squeaking down the mile. del sits up, painfully clutching his head. brutal helps him up...}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{percy, you shit.}
<A>__{...and moves him toward his cell. percy is actually moved to apologize he starts after them with a half laugh, drifting much too close to wild bill's side of the mile...}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{del! hey, you numb wit, i didn't mean nothin' by it! you all ri }
<A>__{...and wild bill's arms thrust out, grabbing percy and slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his throat. percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter chute, thinking he's gonna die. the guards scramble, drawing their clubs as billy strokes percy's hair and whispers in his ear:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{ain't you sweet. soft. like a girl. i druther fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, i think.}
<A>__{billy kisses percy's ear and his hand drops down to squeeze percy's crotch. paul pulls his sidearm, taking aim...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wharton!}
<A>__{...and billy lets go, stepping back with his hands raised, laughing. percy darts across the mile in terror and cringes against the cell opposite, breathing so loud and fast it almost sounds like sobbing.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i let 'im go, i'us just playin' and i let 'im go! never hurt a hair on his purty head!}
<P>__{(grins at percy)}
<D>__{your noodle ain't limp at all, loverboy! i think you sweet on ol' billy the kid...}
<P>__{(sniffs his fingers)}
<D>__{...oooh, but smell you.}
<A>__{down at his cell, del starts laughing shrilly. everybody else starts to realize it, including percy himself...he looks down, sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{lookit, he done piss his pants! look what the big man done! he bus' other people wid 'is stick, mais oui some mauvais homme, but someone touch him, he make water in his pants jus' like a baby!}
<A>__{percy just stares. brutal shoves delacroix into his cell.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{shut up, del.}
<A>__{paul steps to percy, puts a hand on his shoulder. percy shakes his hand off, looks around at their faces, whispers:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you talk about this to anyone, i will get you all fired. i swear that to god.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what happens on the mile, stays on the mile. always has.}
<A>__{the men nod solemnly. nobody's going to talk about this. percy looks at delacroix still snorting in his cell, points at him.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you keep laughing, you french fried faggot. you just keep laughing.}
<A>__{del falls silent. percy turns and storms away as we}
