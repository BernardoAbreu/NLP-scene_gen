<D>__{help!! help!!}
<A>__{pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits... rounds a corner, comes face to face with hanover. hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. his face is badly constricted. his body paralyzed. he clings to a black jack table as a tentacle sac drinks its way up his leg. it's already to his hip. he grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. this guy ain't gonna survive. pantucci yelps and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense. he looks around, sees that there's only one tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring hanover. pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with hanover. then he looks at the sac, filled with regurgitated flesh.}

<A>__{he turns and quickly limps off. hanover's eyes look down at the gun in his hand. then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head. close on: hanover's trembling finger. as it slowly squeezes the trigger. he want to kill himself. needs to hill himself. he squeezes harder. the trigger depresses! click! the gun is empty. hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.}
