<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{no kidding. i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.}

<A>__{dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken collide in the small kitchen. dorothy deftly catches the food in her t shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate. but her shirt is now stained. she starts to quietly implode, and laurel takes command. they know each other well.}
