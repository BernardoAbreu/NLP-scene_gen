<L>__{exterior ice floes night}
<A>__{eret's ship is beset by ice floes. the crew stirs on deck as he paces, grumbling, while nursing his head with a large chunk of ice.}
<D>__{no name do we go back?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{we've nowhere to go! nothing to sell! and no heads to call our own, if we don't turn up with dragons and fast }
<A>__{he's suddenly scooped up in stormfly's talons.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{careful what you wish for!}
<C>__{ug }
<D>__{eret son of eret!}
<A>__{nets whiz past as astrid and the gang rocket out of range.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{what is this?!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{a kidnapping.}
<A>__{ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{yay! can he ride with me? can he? can he?}
<A>__{both eret and tuffnut groan in protest.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you're gonna show us the way to drago.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{and help dragon riders sneak into drago's camp? just kill me now.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{that can be arranged. stormfly, drop it.}
<A>__{in enthusiastic response, stormfly pops open her talons, sending eret plummeting. he wails and flails as he hurtles toward the ice far below.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{good girl! stormfly, fetch.}
<A>__{she dives after him, just as enthusiastically. on eret, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{all right! okay! i will take you to drago!}
<A>__{stormfly suddenly snatches him out of his free fall just before hitting the ice. astrid giggles and cracks her knuckles.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{works every time.}
