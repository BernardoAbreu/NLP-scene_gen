<A>__{in a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. they are young catholic fanatics babington, ramsay, and francis throckmorton. a fourth man stands before them, his back to us, watching savage. at first we don't see who he is.}
<C>__{reston }
<D>__{his weakness endangers us all. he can't go on with us. and we can't leave him behind.}
<A>__{now the man turns and looks intently at babington, and we see he is robert reston; no longer in the clothes of a priest.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{who will help him?}
<A>__{babington rises. reston nods his approval. babington goes off through the trees. reston and the others follow a little behind.}
<C>__{savage}
<P>__{( singing)}
<D>__{ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii evae. ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle }
<A>__{he sings on as babington approaches him, seeming no longer to know what's happening. babington takes the pistol from his hand.}
<C>__{babington}
<D>__{make your peace with god.}
<A>__{savage stares, and suddenly realises what babington means to do. terror overwhelms him.}
<C>__{savage}
<D>__{no, tom! don't kill me! i don't want to die!}
<A>__{now he's blubbering with fear. babington is shaken by this, and can't shoot. reston begins to pray aloud.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala }
<A>__{the others join in with the words of the well known psalm. babington too joins in, now weeping.}
<C>__{reston and others}
<D>__{quoniam tu mecum es, domine. virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt }
<A>__{bang! savage falls dead.}
