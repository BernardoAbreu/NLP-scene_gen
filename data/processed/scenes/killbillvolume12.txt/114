<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{overhead shot exterior cemetery night we look down on a spooky texas graveyard... tombstones...graves...dirt...low hanging fog. this could be the opening shot of a texas zombie movie. we also see two men with shovels (one which is budd, the other which is ernie) digging up a grave. budd's beat to shit pickup is in the shot too. its headlight beams shining on the two men. and last but not least, the bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed of budd's pickup. the bride she begins to come to from the shot in her arm. some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her. a big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots. her eyelids flutter open...and she sees stars. a giant, black texas night sky full of them. she has no idea where she is. she turns her head to the left and sees, back window and cab of truck. she turns her head to the right and sees, hatch gate to flatbed. she listens...she hears, crickets...the sound of two men digging...one of the men says something to the other in spanish...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{she hears one of the shovels hit something buried... the two men speak to each other in unsubtitled spanish...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{we hear them lifting something heavy, we might assume is a coffin. the bride however knows not what to think. boom...they set it down. she hears boots approaching the flatbed, the crunching of leaves leading in her direction...}
<B>__{till...}
<A>__{with a clang and a scrape the latches on the gate of the flatbed are yanked out, and it lowers open with a crash. revealing budd, looking down on her.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.}
<A>__{the grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck. she falls to the dirt hard. once in the dirt, the bride sees an old coffin that's been dup up. next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of "fistful of dollars." and a freshly dug grave, with a pile of dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads; "paula schultz." budd and ernie stand over her. the bride just glares up at the two tormentors, with the only weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare. budd turns to ernie and says in spanish, subtitled in english;}
<C>__{budd }
<D>__{look at those eyes. this bitch is furious. you grab her feet, i will get her head.}
<P>__{(english)}
<D>__{got anything to say?}
<A>__{the bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she won't give it to them.}
<C>__{budd }
<D>__{in america white women call this the silent treatment.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{and we let 'em think, we don't like it.}
<A>__{the two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift the bride and carry her over to the pine box. she struggles with her bound legs and arms...both men drop her to the ground. budd whips out a can of mace from his pocket.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at this.}
<A>__{he holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. she stops. her eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to budd.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{looky here bitch, this is a can of mace. now you're goin underground tonight, and that's all there is to it. but, when i bury ya, i was gonna bury you with this.}
<A>__{he removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the beam.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{but if you're gonna act like a horse's ass, i will spray this whole goddamn can in your eyeballs. then you'll be blind, burnin, and buried alive. so what's it gonna be sister?}
<A>__{her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{you may be stupid, but at least you ain't bloody stupid.}
<A>__{the two men lift up the bride, and carry her over to the pine box and place her in. budd puts the flashlight inside. he picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over the coffin...}
<B>__{when...}
<A>__{...he locks eyeballs with the bride... ...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.}
