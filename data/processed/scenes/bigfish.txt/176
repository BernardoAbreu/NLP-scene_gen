<L>__{interior shack day}
<A>__{the inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. a fire burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows. with her back turned to him, jenny hill plays the piano. edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him. without turning, she says...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you must be edward bloom.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<A>__{she keeps playing.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no one would come out here unless they had business. and no one would have business with me except for you. you're buying the town.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{apparently i've overlooked this one piece of it, and i'd like to remedy that. you see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{so i've heard.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will offer you more than it's worth. and you know you won't have to move. nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.}
<A>__{jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. she turns to face him. edward still doesn't recognize her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{now let me get this straight. you'll buy the swamp from me, but i will stay in it. you'll own the house, but it'll still be mine. i will be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another. do i have that right?}
<A>__{strange to hear it put that way, but }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{in so many words, yes.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{then i don't think so mr. bloom. if nothing is going to change, i'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's not like you're going to lose anything. you can ask anyone in town. i've been nothing if not generous. i want the best for everyone.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{mr. bloom, why are you buying this land? some sort of midlife crisis? instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?}
<A>__{he looks at her, puzzled and surprised. no one has really asked before.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{helping people makes me happy.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm not convinced you should be happy.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm sorry. have i offended you?}
<A>__{she finally turns to face him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no, you did exactly what you promised. you came back. i was just expecting you sooner.}
