<A>__{pre title sequence: a glacial ice cover stretches for miles. the last frontier on earth is a harsh land of snow and ice. we move closer: creeping slowly over a graveyard of skeletal remains. bones and shards of bones protrude from the snow like small flags. and beyond those bones lies blood, darkly rich in color, soaking deep into the once pristine snow. this is fresh blood. a barn or a structure resembling a barn lives on the edge of the sea covered in snow and surrounded by enormous tabular icebergs. this structure has been bruised by the hands of time, the weight of endless falling snow that gathers on its roof and the wicked wind of this, the coldest place on earth. smoke pours from a chimney. subtitle: bouvetoya whaling station antarctica 1904}
