<C>__{raspy voice }
<D>__{but i can understand you don't want your mistakes pointed out to you. i can relate to that, old bob.}
<A>__{cole looks around in spite of himself. nothing to see but the walls and the landscape paintings.}
<C>__{raspy voice }
<D>__{hey, i know what you're thinking. you're thinking i don't exist except in your head. i can see that point of view. but you could still talk to me, couldn't you? carry on a decent conversation?}
