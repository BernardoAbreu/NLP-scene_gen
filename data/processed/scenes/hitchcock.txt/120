<L>__{exterior beach house, santa barbara day}
<A>__{wind blows sand off the dunes. alma sits in the parked car outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the seat next to her. an inkling that they may not be as magical as she had hoped. no matter. she checks her reflection in the rearview and applies some lipstick, readying herself. she collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck. she sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of whit. something doesn't feel right. she turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees whitfield cook making love to a young woman it is the pretty secretary from the studio lot. alma and whit's eyes meet. whit is horrified at being caught. alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock.}

<A>__{she struggles to get the key in the ignition. he puts his hand desperately on the car door.}
<C>__{whitfield cook }

<A>__{whit smiles feebly.}
<C>__{whitfield cook }
<D>__{we can't all be geniuses.}
<A>__{alma tries to hide what a body blow this is.}
<C>__{whitfield cook }
<D>__{alma you're incredibly talented. but, after all... we want him to read the script with an open mind.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't worry about that, whit.}
<A>__{she starts the car and drives off. whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...}
