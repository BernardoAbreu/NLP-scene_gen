<L>__{interior school counselor's office 2:30 that day}
<A>__{jackie and luke harrison ruggedly handsome man, mid forties, charming, disarming, and smart as they come. they sit side by side on a couch across from ruth franklin, an elementary school counselor}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{mr. and mrs. harrison, while change is exhilarating for adults, it can be quite challenging for a child.}
<A>__{luke's beeper beeps. he ignores it; focuses on mr. franklin.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i won't get that...it's fine. change. we were talking about change.}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{the fact that you two are remarrying obviously has annabelle overjoyed...}
<P>__{(they look at her, dumbfounded)}
<D>__{and she's very excited about your move to switzerland.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she said we're getting remarried?}
<A>__{suddenly a long bell rings jackie stands up, startled.}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{only a fire drill. my concern is that annabelle seems apathetic towards her work knowing she's leaving before the end of the semester.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mrs. franklin we're not }
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{planning on getting }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{remarried. there is no move.}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<P>__{(trying to appear unfazed)}
<D>__{really? well then my concern for }
<A>__{luke's beeper beeps again. they talk right over mrs. franklin...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{are you here?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because you don't really seem here.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm here. i've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing?!}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{something's up wi...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you think i didn't get that?}
<A>__{she cuts a look at mrs. franklin.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{excuse him. he never learned how to turn the darn thing off.}
<A>__{and reaches. does it for him.}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{i'm wondering if there's anything going on at home that could be intensifying annabelle's need to create this fantasy?}
<A>__{long pause. then suddenly they both start speaking at once.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly. but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her and the kids i might add she moved in last month.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age }
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{rachel's not half my age.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we're not discussing your age.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, we're not discussing rachel's age either.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{they want to be with you luke, they go to your house to be with their father.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jackie, they come to be part of my life. rachel is part of that life.}
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{mr. harrison, i hear you talking about your life, your needs, but are you really in touch with what annabelle needs?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(suddenly fierce)}
<D>__{this man would walk thru fire for annabelle, gladly, any day of the week.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{napalm.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up }
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jackie, she was five minutes late }
<C>__{mrs. franklin}
<D>__{i'm wondering if annabelle is responding to the underlying hostility that exists between rachel and mrs. harrison...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{of course she's responding to it. you think it's easy for any of us? you think it's easy for jackie to watch her kids being looked after by someone who has half the experience she does? of course she's going to be hostile, irrational, and defensive.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{thank you luke.}
<A>__{mrs. franklin doesn't quite know what to say. the bell rings.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thank you mrs. franklin. jackie?}

<D>__{it's wednesday night. she's at my house. i will talk to her.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i will call from work. we can have a conference call.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you tried that last week and we were on hold forty five minutes...}
<A>__{and they're out the door. you can hear the fight as it echoes down the elementary school hallway.}
