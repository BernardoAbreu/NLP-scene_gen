<L>__{interior airport food court day}
<A>__{kirk is picking up a coffee. as he walks on, he takes a sip. the lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{way to go, big slick.}
<A>__{stainer is now next to kirk, who glares back at him as they walk across the food court. a short, plain girl behind the orange julius counter gives them an apprehensive wave.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{oh, shit. let's go this way.}
<A>__{stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects their path away from her. kirk waves.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{nobody. just some chick i boned once when i was drunk. you look like shit, bro.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thanks. i had trouble sleeping last night. this molly thing... i don't want to want this, you know? it just seems too good to be true. i just don't get it.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{i know what you mean. there has to be some explanation.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i can't think of one. not one that makes any sense.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well, let's spitball it a little. you've got dick for money so she's no gold digger. oohh! did you ever see double indemnity?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{please don't say she wants me to kill someone.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{okay, then... maybe she's on a scavenger hunt. you know, like find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball bat and a fat, bald tsa agent that kind of thing.}
<A>__{kirk is no longer responding.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{oh, shit, dude. al qaeda. think about it. you're a tsa agent, she's a terrorist...}
