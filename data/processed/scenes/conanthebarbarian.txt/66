<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior great wall day}
<A>__{khalar singh stands atop the wall, awaiting conan. fariq draws close.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{let me take care of this thief, father. he's beneath your notice.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{he killed remo, likely his cavalry legion as well. whatever he is, he is more than a mere thief.}
<A>__{then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.}
<B>__{conan and tamara}
<A>__{conan holds a squirming, but bound tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{be still!}
<A>__{conan thrusts tamara in khalar's direction.}
<C>__{conan }
<P>__{(yelling to khalar)}
<D>__{i have what you want! where's my gold?!}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<P>__{(yelling back)}
<D>__{triple your price. come and claim it.}
<A>__{gates of the wall moments later the gates open and khalar strides out into the clearing.}
<B>__{conan and tamara}
<A>__{stand a hundred feet ahead.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{send her to me.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{send the gold.}
<A>__{khalar singh throws the gold sack. it lands halfway between them. he sends tamara ahead, her mouth gagged. but the moment tamara reaches the gold from out underneath the sand, four horsemen rise up out of the desert floor. they each bear weighted nets and spiked lances, and they surround conan. the first rider gallops towards conan who simply lops off the horses front legs. as the beast collapses, conan crushes the rider's skull with his broadsword. the next two riders attack together, but conan dodges their nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into the other rider's chest. he dives at and tackles the first rider, toppling him, along with his horse. he snaps the second rider's neck. the last rider comes at conan, who horizontally slashes right through the horse's neck and then the rider's neck. both human and animal head tumble to the desert floor. all four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{smiles. he's got tamara by the neck.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you're fast. but are you fast enough?}
<A>__{conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where cheren and his archer prepare to fire. conan rushes forward as the flaming arrows stream toward him. explosions rip through the air where conan was, throwing up a huge dust cloud. conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack. but khalar singh is not there. he has withdrawn inside the gates. baring his teeth, conan runs at the wall itself. cheren and the archers let loose another volley at conan, who evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword. explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch conan as he}
<B>__{reaches the great wall}
<A>__{conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a mountain lion. reaching out, he launches himself up, taking half the vertical of the wall in a single leap. digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two upward bounds.}
<B>__{wall walk}
<A>__{conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the great wall.}
<B>__{fariq}
<A>__{tries to hide his surprise. even as he draws his sword, conan takes out the four soldiers in his way.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{you should have run, while you could.}
<A>__{conan looks at the sword. it strikes a chord in him. it is the sword his father forged! enraged, conan charges the slight fariq. fariq partially parries the attack. he's obviously well trained, but he's no match for conan. the tip of conan' blade cuts a large gash in fariq's cheek.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{fariq!}
<A>__{khalar singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and flinging him away from the barbarian. fariq struggles to stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment. conan and khalar singh size each other up on the narrow wall walk.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{i wasn't cowering. i was studying. you're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. your speed and power makes up for a lack of finesse. i've seen such fighting before cimmerian.}
<A>__{enraged, conan charges khalar singh. he swings down on khalar singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds nothing but air. khalar is fast.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{cimmerian it is. now it makes sense. you came for blood, not gold.}
<A>__{conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a broad arc, with all his might. even in the small space, khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. he sidesteps conan's attack and backhands conan's face with the flat of his tulwar. conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing khalar could have just as easily sliced his throat.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{your people barely afforded me a challenge. you're little more than beasts.}
<A>__{conan comes at khalar with twice as much fury, smashing entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades the attack. down the wall walk they move, conan attacking while khalar seems complacent enough just to defend.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{you've come a long way, barbarian, only to fail.}
<A>__{khalar ducks conan's last wild swing and gashes conan twice, both deeply in his midsection. khalar then kicks conan, sending the cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet. crunch. conan lands directly on his back, his sword clattering away from him. khalar's men back away into a circle. conan struggles to get on all fours. khalar kicks conan in his shattered chest, lifting conan off the ground with his might. he follows up with a devastating punch to conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.}
<B>__{crunch.}
<A>__{conan can only bleed as khalar looms over him.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{so much for vengeance.}
<P>__{(to his soldiers)}
<D>__{get me oil and a torch.}
<A>__{soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{is that really the best you could do? is that as far as you could think ahead? just rush in and kill me?}
<A>__{behind khalar singh, conan spots tamara being brought up, her hands bound. her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as well.}
<C>__{tamara' hands}
<A>__{between the bonds she slips down a blade. it's conan's dagger. she quickly cuts her bonds. with all the attention focused on conan, no one is quick enough to stop her as grabs the torch from the soldier, lighting the arrows in cheren's quiver. cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched arrows.}
<C>__{cheren}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{but it's far too late. tamara hits the floor, beside conan.}
<B>__{boom. explosion}
<A>__{the blast sends parts of cheren flying in every direction. ukafa, fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the concussion. khalar singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is thrown against the wall!}
<B>__{khalar singh}
<A>__{the warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the explosion. he looks up. the entire parapet is on fire. he grits his teeth and climbs the wall.}
<B>__{atop the wall}
<A>__{a thick wall of flame rages before khalar. conan and tamara are gone. he looks over the far side of the wall, where two figures on horseback ride off into the distance, tamara holding conan atop the horse. ukafa and fariq rise and see what khalar singh sees.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{ukafa, you will take half our forces north, to the sea. i will take the rest south.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{what of me, father?}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you will return to khor kalba. you will feed the women to the beast until you find our queen.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{i will not. i will track the barbarian with you }
<A>__{enraged, khalar singh grabs him by the back of his head, pulling him in close.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you think i care what you wish?! you want to play warrior? it is not in you. one day you will be king, but warlord, never.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{i can. let me prove it to you!}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you will not risk your life again. you are my line, my successor. you will not throw away all that i have worked for.}
<A>__{a smile creeps up on ukafa's face, watching fariq's embarrassment. he withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<P>__{(without looking at ukafa)}
<D>__{if i find you smiling before you bring me the girl, i will take every tooth i see.}
<A>__{ukafa buries the smile as khalar turns to the wall of flames left in conan's wake.}
