<L>__{exterior fuji maru machine shop night}
<A>__{knee deep in water, an edgy mulligan watches finnegan as he disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary generator. his eyes keep shifting around. over in the far corner vivo is watching pantucci working over a metal lathe, repairing the cylinder head. metal on metal. vivo sits up on a barrel, trying to keep his feet out of the water.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{so...if the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{'cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...}
<A>__{vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{what i want to know is why the goddamn ocean is always cold...since i'm a kid i hate god damn cold water.}
<A>__{then out of the corner of his eye, vivo sees something move. he spins around. nothing but pipes and hoses.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{someone's back there.}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{hey! come out here!}
<A>__{finnegan and pantucci stop working. all eyes are focused on the maze of pipes. things are hissing, humming and rumbling. nothing moves.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{check it out!}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{hey! you hear me? come out! still no response.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{will you check it the hell out!!}
<A>__{disgusted, vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly.}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{man this shit is cold!}
<A>__{he walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. his pulse rifle rising.}
<C>__{vivo }
<D>__{i'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this...}
<A>__{then he hears a strange slurping and sucking sound coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway.}
<C>__{vivo }
<D>__{i'm not screwing around with you man...i hate the cold water.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{what is it man?}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{i'm looking...}
<A>__{vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading down the little alleyway. he looks behind some pipes. the slurping gets louder. then he sees it. his eyes widen }
<C>__{vivo }
<D>__{on shit!}
<A>__{and that's the last thing he ever says. because just then, from a dark area between the pipes, something shoots out! mulligan, finnegan, and pantucci stare in horrified amazement as vivo is viciously yanked into the pipes. a moment later a wash of blood is flung across a wall. mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{vivo!! vivo!!}
<A>__{as mulligan's attention diverts, finnegan instinctively heads for vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. mulligan swings around. kachunk!! his rifle is armed. the laser dot fixes on finnegan's forehead.}
<C>__{mulligan }
<D>__{touch it and you're dead, asshole!}
<A>__{finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out mulligan.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{don't shoot, man, don't shoot!}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{what happened to vivo?! what the hell happened to vivo?}
<A>__{everybody's breathing hard. freaked out. major tension. blood drips down the wall.}
