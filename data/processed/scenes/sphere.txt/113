<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. it's smart. it's approaching us in a simple way. like you would a dog. holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.}

<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you don't think weapons are important?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i think we should be careful. consider his emotional response.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you want to put him on your couch, norman. grill him about his childhood?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{when he uses a phrase like "i am happy", i think we should think twice about what we ask him.}
<A>__{"do not be afraid" the all stare at the screen, stunned.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{jerry, can you understand what we're saying?}
<A>__{"every word" norman walks up to the screen, close to it.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she's not gonna know.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{she wired this system.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.}
<A>__{on ted and norman }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't gimme that psychology bullshit, norman. psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. it's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. with an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.}
<A>__{on harry and barnes }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer. he'd run screaming "witchcraft". and you couldn't explain it to him, either. modems, microchips, particle physics.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{edmunds?}
<A>__{on ted and norman }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{frankly, ted, i'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{edmunds?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{because if jerry is powerful and also emotional...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{damn it, edmunds?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{... it raises a very serious question: what happens if jerry ets mad}
