<L>__{25 small street. hacene. outside. day.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{ali, my son ... where have you been hiding?}
<A>__{ali turns suddenly, then pulls back so that his back is against the wall of the alley.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(in sharp voice)}
<D>__{don't move!}
<A>__{then he glances at the others.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{hands still.}
<A>__{the others are three young algerians, hacene's bodyguards. hacene le bonois is tall with short legs out of proportion with his enormous chest. he is somewhat corpulent. he has a wide face, a cheerful and self confident expression. his clothing is a strange combination of algerian and european which does not, however, appear ridiculous, but imposing. at ali's remark, his expression changes, becomes amazed and baffled. but at the same time, his eyes give away the brain's attempt to find an explanation and a solution.}
<C>__{hacene}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{you know i never carry weapons ...}
<A>__{ali keeps his arms and hands hidden under his djellabah.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{hacene laughs warmly, and stretches out his hands which are enormous, thick and rough.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{you afraid of these ...?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{don't move, hacene.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{why are you afraid? we've always been friends. one might even say that i brought you up ... isn't it true, ali?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{it's true.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{what's happened to you?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{the nlf has condemned you to death.}
<A>__{hacene is stunned. he speaks aloud his thoughts in a soft voice.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{ah, so its come to this ...}
<A>__{then he bursts into loud laughter, and seems to turn to the three guards at his back.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{i'm dying of laughter! ha ... ha ... ha ...}
<A>__{ali doesn't speak. he continues to stare at hacene. hacene suddenly stops laughing. his tone of voice changes, becomes brusque and hurried.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{how much are they paying you?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{they're not paying me anything. they've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. decide.}
<C>__{hacene}
<D>__{what ... what must i decide?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you've got to change occupations, hacene. right away!}
<A>__{hacene makes a gesture as if to emphasize what he is going to say.}
<C>__{hacene}
<P>__{(with irony)}
<D>__{okay, you convince me.}
<A>__{then suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a shrill scream, like fencers who before plunging their swords, try to frighten their adversaries. simultaneously, he hurls himself forward, head lowered and arms outstretched. ali steps aside, and releases a blast of machine gun fire. hacene falls flat on his face. there is movement. some passersby approach. the three boys try to escape.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{the barrel of the machine gun is visible through the opening in his djellabah. ali's voice is quivering angrily:}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{look at him well! now nobody can do whatever he wants in the casbah. not even hacene ... least of all you three pieces of shit! go away now ... go away and spread the word ... go on!}
