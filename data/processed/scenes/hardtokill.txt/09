<C>__{storm}
<D>__{let's go, boys. i'm missing the oscars.}
<A>__{he is less than forty yards away, looking lengthwise down the car from its rear. a beat, as storm picks up the sound before we do. storm's pov station wagon a paneled, expensive model approaches. the wagon pulls up, a short distance from the limo. a man gets out from the wagon. a beat later, the driver exits the limo. both are armed. they check out the area, in all directions.}
<B>__{shack}
<A>__{one man crosses under the eave of the shack reaches up, smashes the single light bulb. the spot goes dark.}
<B>__{with storm}
<A>__{seeing the doors open on both cars. a mature man, calabrese, and his stocky confederate, vitale, step from the limo. two other men one wearing a stylish hat, the other bareheaded step from the wagon. they cross to the shadowed, shack area.}
<C>__{storm }
<P>__{(to himself, softly)}
<D>__{i know you, calabrese. but who are these mystery guests?}
<A>__{the two shadow men are obscured by the shack and the position of calabrese and vitale.}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{starts his camera soundlessly whirring. he positions his high tech directional mike, slipping on earphones. wharf conspirators there is noise from various wharf machinery on adjacent piers, but the high tech listening equipment still brings in the sound with acceptable clarity.}
<C>__{calabrese}
<D>__{ murder is a serious business, my friend. and an expensive one.}
<C>__{shadow man with hat}
<D>__{you'll be well compensated, calabrese. money now and a lot more when i get into that office. you can take that to the bank.}
<B>__{through telephoto lens}
<A>__{despite the shadows, it's plain the man with the hat is in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. calabrese, by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.}
<C>__{calabrese}
<D>__{slowly ... slowly. always with caution.}
<C>__{shadow man with hat}
<D>__{i'm up to here with caution! that fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa sprouts he ain't gonna die of natural causes.}
<C>__{calabrese}
<D>__{all i'm counseling is a little patience. the man is public. he's in the paper every day.}
<C>__{shadow man with hat}
<D>__{yeah? well, the next time i read about him, it better be in the obituaries.}
<B>__{on storm}
<A>__{he squints over the camera, straining to see with the naked eve frustration angle calabrese and vitale glancing to each other. they're tough guys, but in some hard to define way, the two shadow men are tougher.}
<C>__{bareheaded shadow man}
<D>__{enough bullshit. can you do the job or not? if you can't }
<C>__{vitale}
<D>__{we'll do it.}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{knowing he's on to something super hot.}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(to himself, soft but intense)}
<D>__{who are you? get out of those shadows }
<A>__{it's driving him crazy that he can't make out the shadow men's faces. he peers around the wharf, looking for some better vantage pointerior shack conspirators keep talking. angle storm darting closer, using the row of bulk containers for cover. he takes up a new position, nearer the shack re aims the camera. lookout #1 (mikey) hears something peers directly at the spot where storm is hiding.}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{ducks quickly back out of sight. as he does this, his earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone off storm's head. he cannot hear what the conspirators say next but the audience can.}
<B>__{conspirators}
<C>__{shadow man with hat}
<D>__{the job is a light plane ... a lear p61. we want it to take off we don't want it to land.}
<A>__{calabrese becomes aware of mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals mikey to proceed. mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward the line of containers.}
<B>__{shadow man with hat}
<A>__{steps forward into the light. his face comes clearly into view. well dressed, magnetic, bobby kennedy ish he is l.a. assemblyman vernon trent.}
<C>__{trent }
<P>__{(to calabrese, with menace)}
<D>__{you told us this dock was clean }
<A>__{storm's hiding place mikey steps around one container (out of view of the other men) to the exact spot where storm was. but storm isn't there. mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere: storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. the blow is so devastating it knocks mikey's feet out from under him so that he topples face forward into storm's arms, out cold. storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to the ground. storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. kneeling down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his injury one of mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his fingers. storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the big guy's hand.}

<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{mikey }
<A>__{guns come out. calabrese and vitale start this way }
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{bolts back up the wharf, toward his car.}
<B>__{calabrese and vitale}
<A>__{hurry up to their fallen comrade. they see storm 50 yards back up the pier, fleeing. vitale takes off after him at a dead run. at that instant:}
<B>__{trent}
<A>__{moves into frame beside calabrese. the bareheaded shadow man with him is police captain dan holland (in civilian business suit) 21 years on the force, hard as nails. conspirators' pov they see vitale pull up, on foot, as storm's car roars off into the darkness. vitale seems close enough to pick out the license number.}
<B>__{back to trent}
<A>__{as his face moves into the light. merciless, implacable.}

<P>__{(to calabrese)}
<D>__{whoever that sonofabitch is, i don't want him to get an hour older.}
<C>__{calabrese}
