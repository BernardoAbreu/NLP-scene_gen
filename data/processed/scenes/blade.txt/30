<A>__{we are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive. exactly what and where this place is will become more clear later on. but for now, the camera drifts through the warren of aisles. along the way, we catch a glimpse of a hulking silhouette cowering behind a series of japanese shoji screens. later on, we find }
