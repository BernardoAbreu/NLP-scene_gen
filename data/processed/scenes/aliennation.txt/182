<A>__{jetson moves into the shadowy confines. he hears an incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner. he moves to it. turns the spigot, stopping the drip. other drips are heard from a dozen other hidden recesses all around him. he glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the wall above the sink. suddenly he sees the movement of something behind him. he spins with the shotgun. a huge shadow moves along the wall. he pivots the shotgun again toward the source of the shadow. it's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the ceiling. jetson lets out a deep breath.}
