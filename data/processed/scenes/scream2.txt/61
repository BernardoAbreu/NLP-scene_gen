<L>__{interior lobby a second later}
<A>__{sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. she moves into a curtained section where the water fountain is. she looks up and sees randy flying out of the theatre. he exits outside looking for her. the cops are right behind him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hello sidney.}
<A>__{sidney spins around. cotton weary stands before her. shoulders slumped, his face pained.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{cotton.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{can we talk?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i don't think that's a good idea.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{look, yesterday wasn't my idea. that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you want from me, cotton?}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{you could start with an apology.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i did that.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{you wrote me a letter. very cordial. very appropriate.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how? what could i say that would make a difference? i took away a year of your life how do i apologize for that?}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{i wish it was just a year. i lost everything because of you. i have nothing now. look at me, this is what i've become.}
<A>__{a long silence. sidney is hanging on by threads.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when i'm not reminded of what i've done. i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being. and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i don't think the words exist.}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{i just thought if i saw you face to face, maybe it would help.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{did it?}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{it helped me realize one thing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{you're a self obsessed little cunt like your mother.}
<A>__{and with that, cotton flips on a dime. his face turns evil. sidney races by him as he throws out his arm, stopping her just as...}
<B>__{the two police guards}
<A>__{appear, grabbing him from behind. they throw him against the wall, retaining him. randy appears at sid's side.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. they do a body search, pulling from his coat a large revolver. cotton just smiles.}
