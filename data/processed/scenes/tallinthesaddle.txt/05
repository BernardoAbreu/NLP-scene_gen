<P>__{(as he steps up to the seat)}
<D>__{ and a passenger.}
<A>__{dave glares at rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully }
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{mind if i ride up here?}
<A>__{dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. his only answer to rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. and now dave turns on the agent, who becomes the target of his pent up wrath.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{where's them wimmen?}
<C>__{stage agent}
<D>__{up at the hotel.}
