<L>__{exterior campsite night}
<A>__{the group has made camp in the jungle. the mood is somber, most of the marchers asleep already. three or four tents have been put up. in one tent, kelly sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up to his chest. sarah comes in.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{there you are. your dad's looking for you.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i doubt that.}
<A>__{sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry the broad red smear across its front.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh, come on. go talk to him.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why? he likes to be alone. i can stay with you.}
<A>__{in the campsite, all is still. the nocturnal jungle hoots and buzzes around the sleeping marchers. in his tent, roland abruptly sits up. as if he heard something. he looks out the open flap. in the middle of the campsite, he sees ajay stop in his tracks, head cocked. roland gets up and goes outside, joining ajay in the middle of the camp.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{you hear something?}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{no. i feel something.}
<A>__{roland looks at him. this isn't so good. he looks out at the shifting jungle. he notices a thin plume of smoke rising up over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<A>__{in sarah's tent, kelly and sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying to get a few minutes' rest. sarah's shirt hangs over them, swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap. as the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side, we notice the broad red smear across the front. oh, that's right it's blood. the baby t rex's blood. at the ridge of camp, the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire that's been lit by dr. burke. he's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he cracks the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan. roland and ajay run up behind him.}
<C>__{roland}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?!}
<A>__{burke leaps out of the way as roland kicks dirt on the fire. bmbb! roland, ajay, and burke all freeze. what was that? in sarah's tent, sarah and kelly sit up. they felt it too. bmbb! at the cocking fire,}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{get my weapon.}
<A>__{ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold, staring down at the ground. bmbb! a recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles concentric circles spreading to the outer edges. bmbb! in sarah's tent, sarah and kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food into ziploc bags. bmbb! now they leap into sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves, and draw the zipper up, all the way around. outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent. sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last few inches, but the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent. it sniffs, snorting the air in and out. it looks around the tent. it sniffs sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with the blood of the baby tyrannosaur. the adult tyrannosaur gurgles again, cooing and cocking its head curiously. in the sleeping bag, sarah and kelly's eyes are barely visible, wide in panic. the rex sniffs and nudges the bag, trying to figure out what this thing is. it rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and then rises, straights up taking the whole tent with it! the stakes pop out of the ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground beneath it. in the campsite, the second tyrannosaur now steps out of the jungle, joining the first. panic hits the camp as the sleeping hunters wake up. many of them start to run. roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon lying near the open flap. as he draws close, an enormous t rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep into the mud. roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked hunters flee in all directions.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{for christ's sake, don't run!}
<A>__{but they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed prey that pours across the campsite. some toss random and ill aimed gunshots back at the rexes. across the campsite, nick bursts out of the crowd, sees kelly and sarah struggling to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm. he rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into the jungle. in the middle of the crowd, malcolm, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd. frantically, he scans the group.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{kelly? keeeeellly?!}
<A>__{but he can't see her. at the edge of camp, the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing hunters into a narrow ravine. up on a rock race, roland scrambles up a steep rock face. no way in hell he's going down that ravine. he sees malcolm, still in the middle of the camp, start to head for the ravine.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{malcolm! over here!}
<A>__{malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face, scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders. behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the camp toward him.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{faster!!}
<A>__{malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the rock face and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs and roland reaches down, grabs malcolm by the hair and pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp. the rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear his teeth snap together, closing around nothing but air. it turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing hunters, and takes off after them. malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a crunch. roland unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap. in the ravine, kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with sarah and nick, hears her father screaming her name and looks up. malcolm and roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{kelly, up here!}
<A>__{but kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine now, and drawing closer to the group. some hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the ravine is deepening, there's no way out. one rex grabs hold of a hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face. the second rex picks up another hunter and snaps its massive head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck. the hunter goes flying forward and crashes into carter, dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls. the rest of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the rex lifts its foot, we see carter is actually stuck to the bottom of it and when the animal takes its next step it crushes him into the earth. up on th rock face, malcolm is frantic.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i gotta get down there!}
<A>__{down in the ravine, it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and nick knows it. he bursts ahead of sarah and kelly and spots something off to his left. it's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock face. but there's something about the way the water is falling that tells him something.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sarah kelly come here!}
<A>__{he grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight at the waterfall. apparently, he intends to jump right into the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what are you }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{the three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear through the water. dr. burke, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as they vanish. behind the waterfall, there is a small recess, which is what nick had hoped for. it's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough for him, sarah, and kelly to cover behind the flowing water. breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shhhh... shhhh...}
<A>__{with an enormous splash, something bursts through the cascading water and crashes into them. dr. burke.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{get out of the way!}
<A>__{he pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the water as he can. foooom! now another shape bursts through the watery curtain. a tyrannosaur head. burke gave away the hiding spot. the four scream as the rex's jaws snap left and right, searching for them, falling just inches short. they squeeze as far back against the wall as they can get. the rex can't quite get its head all the way through the opening so it uses its tongue. a long, dark blue shape slithers out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around them, to pull them out of the cave. burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the cave, which pushes kelly further out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{stop it you're pushed her out stop it!}
<A>__{but burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for himself. his movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck. burke screams and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing water. and that's all the leverage the rex needs. it curls its tongue, wrapping burke up in it and pulling him between its teeth. screaming hideously, he is dragged out, through the waterfall, and disappears. sarah, nick, and kelly stare in horror as the white screen of water turn pink. up on the rock face, malcolm and roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall with burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested. malcolm is nearly hysterical.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{she's okay! they'll stay in there, she's okay!}
<A>__{in a jungle clearing, routed hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he jungle. ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by long "elephant" grass. ajay, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of the grass, shouting to the others.}
<C>__{away}
<D>__{no! don't go into the long grass!}
<A>__{not in the frenzy, they ignore him. behind ajay, the enormous shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding up at the edge of the jungle. ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after the other hunters, waving his arms. up above them, roland and malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view of the plain below. roland can see the hunters leaving trails as they plow through the grass.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{elephant grass!}
<A>__{on the plain, the groups of hunters wades into the middle of the long grass. one of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{they gave up! they're not chasing us!}
<A>__{there are cheers, sighs of relief. in the distance, ajay's voice can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back. up on the rock in the distance, they can see roland, waving his arms madly. but in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind. they continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get further away from the tyrannosaurs. about fifty yards away, the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by the full moon. in the distance, the heads can seethe hunter party. the heads descend, back into the grass. back with the hunters, they continue forward, oblivious. now behind them, four more heads rise up in the grass. as then descend. on all sides of the hunters, the grass ripples as animals move forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes. and these torpedoes are on target. one hunter is suddenly dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall grass. in his place, a long, lizard like tail rises up as the animal drops its head to make the kill. behind him, two more hunters are taken down, and two more animal tails rise up in their place. a hunter ahead hears the rustling and turns. his face turns white as, behind him a velociraptor springs out of the grass. velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs, the second tow of each foot bearing an extra large curved claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes on attack. like now. this raptor snarls and slams into the body of the hunter, taking him down. a feeding frenzy ensues. the hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish into the twitching long grass. another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air, past the full moon, slams into the chest of more human prey, and takes him down, into the grass. behind them, ajay's face falls, defeated. he looks around, realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long grass. around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him. ajay simply closes his eyes. up on the rock, roland turns away from the carnage, pained.}
