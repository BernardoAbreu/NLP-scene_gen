<L>__{interior ceremonial room night}
<A>__{a large, amber hued chamber. the chanting coven forms a circle around a primitive stone altar where kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe. a wooden symbol of thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of reverence. behind the altar, the shape stands in its cell. waiting. loomis is led inside. wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to the altar. looming over the terrified kara. the chanting continues as wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe. at wynn's gesture, there is silence. the worshippers offer an obedient response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of thorn on their wrists. we recognize many of the faces in the congregation. wynn's staff. dr. bonham. mrs. blankenship. the cross eyed attendant from the bus depot. people from all walks of life. faces glazed with sadistic rapture.}

<A>__{jamie's baby is carried forth, crying as it is lain inside a baptismal urn beside kara. ringed by candles and a circle of stones eleven in all etched with symbolic runes.}
