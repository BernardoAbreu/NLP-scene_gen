<L>__{143: interior living room. house. night.}
<A>__{this isn't a good place to be. a dismal lamp supplies light. a close up of helena on the sofa. hears a sound of booze getting poured. but nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice.}
<C>__{berlin }
<D>__{.. i know why you did it darlin, but you're not helping me. every thing they're hearing they think is a lie. now here comes the man i'm desperate to prove exists, & whadda ya know, he turns up at my house, and has a "chat" with you?}
<A>__{by now berlin and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame.}
<D>__{no one in the state of california is gonna believe that. they got the man in there an a 1 f.b.i. inter rogator, and he's taking me to pie ces doesn't believe a word comes outta my head not a word no one believes me i don't believe me ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{don't say that. don't you dare say that .. i believe you ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{then explain it to me. i got enough darkness, don't i?}
<A>__{he doesn't want to. but now he's got to. and so here it comes.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{the man who killed amber is a psychopath. he was up at the in stitute to kill you he don't wanna kill rose he was there to kill you that's the truth and i didn't wanna tell it to you but that's the reason i want you to stay at margie's coz i can't protect you here ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{why does he want to kill me?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{coz he thinks you're a witness.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i can't identify him ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{he don't know that. i didn't.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{then why didn't he kill me?}
<A>__{back at the booze and he's almost inaudible "stop it, will you?"}
<D>__{why didn't he kill me, john?}
<A>__{something snaps in berlin and he throws his glass at the grate.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{will you fucken stop it. i'm not serato .. he didn't kill you coz he wasn't here .. he isn't in the room with you, and lets you live ..}
<A>__{and just as suddenly he's full of remorse. takes helena in his arms with a lot of sorrys. but she isn't interested in apology. there's a passion in her face. and fire even in her blind eyes.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{kiss me, john .. kiss me [he does] i love you, kiss me again [he does] i love you .. are my lips lying to you? kiss my mouth [he does] is my mouth lying to you? he. was. here.}
