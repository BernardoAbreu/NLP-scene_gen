<D>__{for years we'd been hearing rumours that karla was building a private army of his own, outside moscow centre. we knew he had agents scattered round the globe. i started spending time with the moscow gazers combing soviet bulletins and any material i could get.}

<D>__{connie sachs (v.o.) (cont'd) late one night in research, i was trawling through some footage of may day in berlin, 1969. i saw something, george.}
<A>__{connie slows the images down, concentrating... officials in suits are walking into their designated places. we see polyakov amongst them. one of the old soviet veterans, in dress uniform, a chest full of medals, possibly a touch senile, looks at him. just before he is obscured by another official we see what the old veteran does. he salutes polyakov. connie's smile of triumph is reflected on the screen. she lights a cigarette.}
