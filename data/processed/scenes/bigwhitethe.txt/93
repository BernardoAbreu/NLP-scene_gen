<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{high angle on: paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position we've seen him in when he sleeps with margaret. an electric heater glows beside him.}
<L>__{exterior barnell mobile home continuous}
<A>__{tight on: car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road. a pair of heavy men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home.}
<L>__{interior mobile home late night}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door. paul heads to the door.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{state police. is there a mr. barnell here?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(as he unlocks it)}
<D>__{yes, is there something wrong }
<A>__{as he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open. the force of the blow sends paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head. raymond barnell (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up paul and throws him through the serving kitchen serving hatch. raymond leans through the hole.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{hello brother.}
<A>__{he walks around, takes a copy of "usa today" and throws it at paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{raymond? is that...}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{page 16, paul. that's why i love "usa today", news from every fuckin' state. don't you want to read it? i was eaten by wild fuckin' animals. but ya know, despite that, i'm feeling pretty god damned chipper.}
<A>__{paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with raymond right on his heels.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{raymond, let me tell you what happened here. we all thought you were...}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{dead? yeah, i got that impression.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{but you had dropped off the face of the earth.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{and you just decide to make it permanent?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{but there were no records of you anywhere. i checked.}
<A>__{with that, raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs. paul doubles over, gasping for breath.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{in certain lines of quasi legal employment, using your actual id can be a hinderance. but despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on. gotta tell ya, paul, i was pretty pissed.}
<A>__{raymond is about to kick him once more, but paul puts up a hand, begging him to stop. raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a sitting position.}
<C>__{raymond }
<D>__{but then i start to think, paul's no idiot. he woulda told 'em it's not me. unless...}
<A>__{paul can only sit there and wheeze. raymond sits beside him on the floor, pulls out a cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{raymond }
<D>__{so what is it? frame job, lawsuit...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{life insurance.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{figured. so where's my money?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your money?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{they're still... investigating.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what you get?}
<A>__{paul considers whether or not raymond would even remember.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fifty thousand.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(with a shrug)}
<D>__{almost worth coming back for. what's the split? i get half?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(not quite trusting him)}
<D>__{okay. sure.}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{you look good. lost some weight?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{gave up carbs. so what are you doing out here? she not go along with it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who? margaret?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{how she hold up, anyway?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's fine. actually, we're not doing so good right now.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{any kids?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{still can't get one by the goalie, huh.}
