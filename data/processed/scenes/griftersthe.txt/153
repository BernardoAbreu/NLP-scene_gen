<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in the case. then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the floor. lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money to the case. she closes the case, attaches the one clasp that works, picks up the case.}
<C>__{roy }
<D>__{hello, lilly.}
<A>__{two shot, as lilly whirls around, terrified and then relieved. roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness behind him.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{oh! roy! you scared me.}
<A>__{roy enters the room and shuts the door.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{going somewhere?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{somewhere else, that's for sure.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i just came back from phoenix.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{oh, yeah? is the frame holding?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{looks very solid, lilly. sit down. take a minute, tell me about it.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i've really got to }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you're dead, lilly, it worked.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{not for long. not when they do a fingerprint check.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{why should they? the cops are satisfied.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{bobo won't be. he'll spend the money to make sure.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{even so. you still got time. relax a minute, tell me what happened. sit down.}
<A>__{he gestures at the sofa. lilly's holding the attache case. the gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table and one on the floor. she looks around at everything, awkward and embarrassed. but roy hasn't said anything. and he's between her and the door.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{just for a minute.}
<A>__{she backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. roy pulls a chair over so it's directly between lilly and the door. he sits, looking at her with polite interest.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{myra followed you, huh?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo. i guess to get me running. did you tell her about my stash?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(isn't worth discussing)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no, you wouldn't. that's what she was after, though. but why hit on me?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i wouldn't go in on a deal with her. she blamed you for it.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(a shaky laugh)}
<D>__{as though you do what i say.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(cold grin)}
<D>__{that's pretty funny, all right. what happened in phoenix?}
<A>__{remembered emotion makes lilly talk in little fast clusters of words.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{roy, it was terrible. you read about people killing people and all that, but when it happens, my god.}
