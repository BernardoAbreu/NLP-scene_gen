<L>__{interior under the underground night}
<A>__{another night in under the underground kids dance. customers jostle at the bar. couples neck in shadowed corners. loud metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various sculptures on the walls and ceiling. the center of the dance floor is packed. the pillar is missing.}
<B>__{angle on bar}
<A>__{sitting alone at a bar stool though surrounded by tightly packed customers is sandy, a very pretty teenage girl. she is the same basic type as terri; blonde, frail, young. too young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this. sandy stares at her empty glass and stares at it wistfully enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it refilled. she is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye line confirming he is looking at sandy, is jp monroe. the bar stool beside jp is occupied by a teenage boy who has his back to the bar and is talking to a group of his friends. jp has a speculative, predatory look on his face. without shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the barman is leaning over to hear his request. close on sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her. laid alongside the glass is a beautiful long stemmed red rose. sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight at the rose. she raises her eyes and looks across the bar. jp returns the smile. he turns to the boy beside him and murmurs something unheard. the boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is speaking to him. on recognizing jp, however, he vacates the seat without an argument and stands to join his friends. jp looks back across the bar at sandy and gestures at the empty stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face. sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her way across to sit beside jp.}
<B>__{angle on jp and sandy}
<A>__{the deafening music playing in the club means that they have to lean in close to hear each other speak.}

<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{oh come on. there're lots of girls here who look better than ...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{don't do that! don't put yourself down. if you have a quality, be proud of it...}
<A>__{while talking, and without taking his eyes off sandy, jp gestures at the barman and their glasses.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{... let it define you. whatever it is. most of the roses die behind the bar. this is the first i've given out for nearly a month.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{no. really?}
<A>__{two full glasses join the still half full ones on the bar.}
<C>__{jp}
