<A>__{sam 2 has come full circle. he shifts the ping pong table, goes through cabinets in the kitchen, feels inside sam 1 half whittling, half watching.}

<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i want to check underneath there.}

<D>__{you're not moving the model.}

<D>__{get the fuck out of my way!}
<A>__{sam 1 stands, keeps his ground.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{sam 1 is still holding the knife. though he's not about to use it, both sams are aware that it's there. suddenly sam 2 lunges for the knife; an intense struggle ensues teeth clenched, sputtering breaths the two sams less clones right now than animals. sam 2 is able to loosen sam 1's grip on the knife flinging the weapon across the room and swings sam 1 up against the wall. now sam 2 turns to face the model. using both hands he lifts the model up high over his head and pushes the entire thing upside down. a massive crash. there is nothing there but the bare table. sam 1 comes up behind sam 2 with his nose spewing blood, wraps both arms around sam 2's neck. sam 2 elbows him in the ribs a quick, controlled jab spins around, manages to secure sam 1 in an arm lock. but suddenly there is no struggle coming from sam 1: he's stopped fighting. sam 2 removes him from the headlock notices his arm is smudged with sam 1's blood }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{sam 1 has remained bent over, like he's cast in stone, blood raining from his face and pooling at his feet thick and fast. sam 2 just staring, as freaked as he is baffled.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{i hardly touched you.}
<A>__{now he tries to help sam 1.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{let me see.}
<A>__{sam 1 tears away from him. he looks up, his face a mess of blood the whites of his eyes unnaturally bright, shouts:}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{get off me!}
<A>__{sam 1 holds his face with his outstretched hand, as if holding it in place stumbles from the room leaking blood the whole way. a concerned sam 2 watches him go.}
