<L>__{exterior woods the bang}
<A>__{runs into the woods qualen and kristel, hearing hal's noisy retreat, run after him. but travers stops for a second he has spotted evan's footprints in the snow not unlike a neon arrow.}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the gap between him and}
<B>__{evan}
<A>__{who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time it's not easy. evan closes one of the three buckles but}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him }
<B>__{qualen and kristel}
<A>__{in the meantime, get behind hal in a clearing kristel fires over his head.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{hal, caught again, freezes in his tracks.}
<B>__{evan}
<A>__{is still up and running he dodges travers' fire, weaving through trees, getting the second buckle closed he sees the edge, just ahead, and puts on an extra burst of speed }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{does likewise, still firing his clip runs out, but this only buys evan an extra few seconds }
<B>__{the spur}
<A>__{is a rock formation that just out like a diving board evan runs like hell to the edge of it }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{is right behind him, and has slapped a fresh clip in place, but before he can shoot }
<B>__{evan}
<A>__{dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle on the ledge gabe is directly below a few hundred feet looking up, he thinks evan has made it but on the spur edge travers throws himself down, aims quickly but carefully, and fires twenty rounds towards evan's falling figure evan falling evan laughs he hasn't been hit gabe watching}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{come on wait till you're out of range don't pull it yet }
<A>__{long shot evan falling several seconds pass evan is now several hundred feet down and apparently out of firing range }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{stops firing but doesn't seem unhappy at all.}
<B>__{evan}
<A>__{laughs more and pulls the d ring the parachute billows open, inflating }
<B>__{close on the parachute}
<A>__{which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack as quickly as it inflates, it deflates through dozens of holes whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy collapses. evan's exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the chute's guide lines but the more he does this, the faster the chute caves in he screams as the chute finally gives way and plummets right past}
<B>__{gabe on the ledge}
<A>__{who is powerless to do anything but watch }
<B>__{evan}
<A>__{falls the long, full five thousand feet, desperately, uselessly, pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until he's tangled in it like a shroud }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{turns away he can't watch evan hit bottom he grimaces and looks up with absolute hate at}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{who doesn't see gabe he's laughing at evan's desperation, which ends as his death scream is cut off. hal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members behind him. hal looks as angry as gabe.}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{was that walker?}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{no such luck.}
<P>__{(to hal, smiling)}
<D>__{cheer up. everyone should die in a spot this beautiful.}
<A>__{on the ledge below close on gabe who has heard this and is shaking with fury.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't worry. you will.}
<B>__{long shot of mountain}
<A>__{on top, hal reluctantly leads the gang away below, we can see gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges.}
