<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{the room is immaculate; near the door, several over sized suitcases line the wall. bain is sitting at the desk. his walkman is on, music blasting, as he flips casually through the telephone directory. his finger eases down a column stopping at "morgan jennifer." there is a knock at the door. he smiles and tears out the page. there is another, louder knock which bain hears this time. he turn off the walkman and opens the door; a bellboy is waiting with a luggage cart.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{hello, sir. have you some luggage you need carried.}
<A>__{bain gives him a wink and a smile.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{indeed i do.}
