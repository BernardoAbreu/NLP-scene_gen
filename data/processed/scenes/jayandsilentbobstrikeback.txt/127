<P>__{(breaking character)}
<D>__{you are not upstaging me, van der beek!}
<A>__{jay whacks away happily at the actor playing cock knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the bluntcave's nuclear reactor. cock knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling jay back with the saber in his other hand.}
<D>__{cock knocker}
<P>__{(to o.c. chaka)}
<D>__{chaka call off dawson! give me a "cut"!}
<A>__{on cue, jay delivers a kill shot to one of cock knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la empire). silent bob joins jay, as jay turns off this double bong saber, jay grins at cock knocker.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{now whose balls have been busted, bitch?}
<A>__{suddenly, a gun shot rings out. all turn to see a roughed up willenholly, training his gun first on jay, then bob.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{the c.l.i.t. stops here, jay and silent bob!}
<P>__{(revealing badge: calling out)}
<D>__{everyone stay calm. i'm a federal wildlife marshal. these men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{they didn't really steal that monkey.}
<A>__{all turn to see justice approaching from the shadows. willenholly trains his gun on her. jay's mouth drops.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{it was just a diversion so we could steal these.}
<A>__{justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{and they're not the leaders of c.l.i.t. the c.l.i.t. is not real.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{no the clit's real. the female orgasm is a myth.}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{are you guys alright?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i thought you blew up, boo boo kitty fuck.}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you remembered.}
<P>__{(back to business)}
<D>__{it was a frame up, jay. sissy. missy, chrissy, and i are international jewel thieves. we were setting you up as a patsy, but i couldn't go through with it, because i... because i love you.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah? so that means you'll fuck me, right?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{if she does, it'll be considered necrophilia.}
<A>__{all turn to see sissy, missy, and chrissy slinking from the shadows, guns drawn.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{because she's gonna be one dead bitch.}
<P>__{(to justice)}
<D>__{hi, jussy. we catch you at a bad time?}
<C>__{missy}
<D>__{you should've just let these guys go down, jussy.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey, i wanted to go down, but i was waiting until i got to know her a little better. see, there was this little angel on my shoulder, and he said }

<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{let's have those diamonds, jussy.}
<C>__{justice}

<D>__{would any of you lovely ladies like a private audition to be in my movie?}
<A>__{justice high kicks the gun out of sissy's hand. it lands on the ground discharging. then everyone starts shooting and running for cover. jay and silent bob hurl themselves over the bluntmobile. missy and chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely packed craft service table labeled. cast. they pop back up and start firing at willenholly. willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of smarties and a dented can of rc cola. he pops up and returns fire. when both are out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and reload. from behind his table, willenholly yells }
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{why are you shooting at me?!?! i'm just a federal wildlife marshal!!!}
<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{two reasons: one we're walking, talking bad girls, cliches!}
<C>__{missy}
<D>__{and two: because you're a man.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{only on the outside!}
<A>__{the girls and willenholly both pop back up and open fire again. chaka ducks behind the monitor.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{a shitload of white people with guns? time to get my black ass out of here!}
<A>__{he races off, passing justice and sissy, who circle each other defensively, striking kung fu poses.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{you really let me down, justice. throwing it all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{what's it gonna be, sissy? which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{are you kidding me? i taught you all all your moves myself. there's not a style you can bust that i can't defend against.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you're no match for my "shaolin monk."}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yeah, but i can bury you with my "crouching tiger."}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{a little "venus's flytrap"?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i will counter with "dragon crane."}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{how about a little "bitch, my man ain't yo baby's daddy"?}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(beat; smiles)}
<D>__{bring it on.}
<A>__{justice rushes sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down and dirty, girl's cat fight; hair pulling and screaming. behind the bluntmobile, jay and bob watch all the action.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo i hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit.}
<A>__{both bob and jay smile at each other, nodding. banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{mister biggs? mister van der beek? i just wanted to say hi. i'm }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{banky fucking edwards! just the motherfucker we came to see!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{holy shit! what the fuck are you guys doing here?!}
<A>__{sissy has justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching. jay, bob, and banky continue.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{stop the movie?! are you crazy?!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{all these assholes are calling us names on the internet, 'cause of this stupid movie!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i feel for you boys i really do. those net snipers can be really cruel. but miramax paid me a shitload of money for bluntman and chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad mouthing you on some web site is none of my fucking concern!}
<C>__{silent bob}
<D>__{oh but i think it is.}
<A>__{banky stares at silent bob, agog, jay rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{here we go again }
<C>__{silent bob}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{we had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. and as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, bluntman and chronic, when we said property was optioned by miramax films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. as you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position.}
<A>__{banky stares at bob, even more agog, joined by jay. after a beat, jay adds }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{justice now has the advantage over sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{so, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the internet anymore.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the internet. that's what the internet's for: slandering others anonymously. stopping the flick isn't going to stop that!}
<A>__{in the background, we see justice high kick sissy into the air.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well this isn't fair! we went to hollywood, i fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! we ain't leaving empty handed!}
<A>__{on cue, sissy drops from above, landing in jay's lap.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what's up baby? you look good!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<P>__{(pushing sissy off him)}
<D>__{get the fuck offa me, pig!}
<A>__{sissy races at justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair. jay, bob, and banky continue.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you guys are gonna ruin my movie career.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, we want something for our mental anguish.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily. i will give you half of what i made.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{half?!?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{half's not good enough? fine i will give you two thirds of what i made!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{fuck you you already said half? you can't take it back!}
<A>__{silent bob rolls his eyes, banky shakes jay's hand.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{done}
<A>__{justice throws sissy off, onto the floor. both get up, facing each other.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{your shit is so tired, justice!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{call me boo boo kitty fuck bitch!}
<A>__{justice high kicks sissy and she goes flying across the stage. sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop missy and chrissy, knocking them out. willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{hello? truce?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think i killed both of them.}
<A>__{suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and suzanne standing behind him, holding the gun up in the air. justice surveys her handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the bluntmobile.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{c'mon guys. it's over.}
<A>__{jay, bob, and banky pop up from behind the car and join her.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo, i was just about to jump in there and get your back.}
<A>__{then, the sound of sirens rings out in the distance.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{holy shit, the cops! we gotta get out of here!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{no. i'm tired of running.}
<A>__{justice lifts willenholly into a sitting position and taps his face.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you awake, marshal? marshal?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<P>__{(tries to move but can't)}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm paralyzed. the monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! oh the irony!}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(off suzanne's gun)}
<D>__{you're not paralyzed. it was just a tranquilizer.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{jesus! tranqued by a little monkey! my friends in the bureau are never gonna let me live this down!}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you have friends in the f.b.i.?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{they all made it in, but i failed the exam. why the hell else do you think i became a federal wildlife marshal? 'cause i'm a joke!}
<A>__{justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking. then }
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{maybe not. i can make you a deal that'll get you into the f.b.i., regardless of test scores.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{what kind of deal?}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{you drop the charges against jay and silent bob and say you never found the ape. make sure the world knows they're not in control of any c.l.i.t.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{now wait a second }
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{i will explain later, jay}
<P>__{(to willenholly)}
<D>__{in exchange, i will give you the diamonds i stole, and turn in sissy, missy, chrissy, and myself. but i want a reduced sentence.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{you'd be willing to do that?}
<C>__{justice}
<P>__{(off jay)}
<D>__{for him? i'd be willing to do anything.}
<A>__{justice stands and takes jay by the hands.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{i'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's alright. i'm a junkie with a monkey.}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{if i go to prison, will you wait for me?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't know. will we fuck when you get out?}
<A>__{justice smiles and kisses jay passionately. the kiss should say it all, but }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{don't change the subject. will we fuck when you get out?}
<C>__{justice}
<D>__{snoogans.}
<A>__{justice and jay kiss again. suzanne reached up to silent bob, who picks her up. she grabs his face and kisses him. willenholly looks to banky.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{wow. there's a lot of love in the room.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{regardless of what you may have heard. i do not kiss guys.}
