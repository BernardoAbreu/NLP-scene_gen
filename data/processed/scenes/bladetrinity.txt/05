<L>__{interior ziggurat burial vault day}
<A>__{ an empty room with an earthen floor. the sunlight from above barely penetrates down here. one of the figures takes out a battery powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating walls covered with cuneiform writing. the male figure who flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset.}
<C>__{male figure}
<D>__{that's great. we've got dick.}
<P>__{(turning to the others)}
<D>__{is there any reason we had to embark on this cluster fuck during the day?}
<A>__{the woman removes her helmet. this is danica talos. a vampire. intense, appearing to be in her 30s. possessing a regal air. she wears a silver crucifix around her neck.}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{night time's too tricky, grimwood. you know that.}
<A>__{one by one, the others remove their helmets. all vampires: grimwood (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth fangs. asher (4os), a natural born leader with easygoing charisma. wolfe (30s), quiet and deliberative. right now he's readying a portable ground penetrating radar unit. grimwood studies the writing on the walls.}
<C>__{grimwood}
<D>__{what is this chicken scratch?}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{cuneiform. dates back about four thousand years.}
<C>__{grimwood}
<D>__{so why here?}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{because this was the cradle of civilization. he would've been comfortable here.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{i don't know, dan. seems like another dead end.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{i'm not so sure }
<A>__{wolfe looks at his unit, excited. the others gather round.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{there's something beneath us.}
<A>__{on wolfe's radar unit we see a cross section image of the soil and subsurface features beneath them. something has been buried down there.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{is that a body ?}
<A>__{wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit. the image resolves further. it's definitely a body. then, we hear the low rumbling of more hidden counter weights and }

<A>__{slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.}
<C>__{grimwood}
<D>__{what the fuck ?!}
<A>__{grimwood pounds his fist against the stone. it's solid. he tries to find a hand hold, tries to shoulder it open in some way, but the barrier is unmovable. they're trapped.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{radio back up. see if they can open it from the other }
<C>__{wolfe }
<D>__{guys?}
<A>__{wolfe points at the ground. a tiny depression has formed, with sand funneling into it. wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. the grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression gradually widening. curious, wolfe leans closer a clawed, armored hand suddenly explodes upward from the ground. it latches onto wolfe's neck. dragging him down head first! wolfe thrashes, his head still buried beneath the sand. he knocks over the lantern, which flickers, shorting out. asher rushes to wolfe's side. then grimwood. they grab wolfe by the shoulders, screaming, trying to pull him back. asher is kicked by wolfe's thrashing legs. he flies upward, hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned danica joins grimwood. abruptly, they wrest wolfe free headless. blood erupts from the sand. then }

<A>__{unearths itself, roaring. it's difficult to make out in the flickering light. but what we do see is terrifying. spiked, demonic armor, clutching a sword. an elongated, helmeted face with a blood splattered set of hinged fangs hinting at an inhuman physiognomy within. the hinged jaws open, coming at us. and just as the lantern goes out for good we super title: blade iii}
