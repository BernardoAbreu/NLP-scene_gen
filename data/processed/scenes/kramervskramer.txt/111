<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{on the door to o'connor's office as it opens and phyllis comes out. in the background in o'connor's office we see o'connor and murray, talking, laughing. the camera tracks alongside phyllis as she walks to ted kramer's office and opens the door without knocking.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{how about lunch, kramer. i'm buying.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior restaurant, midtown day}
<B>__{on ted and phyllis}
<A>__{as they sit across from one another. a waiter stands over them, setting drinks in front of them.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{perrier and lime...}
<P>__{(placing a drink in front of phyllis)}
<D>__{...and scotch with soda.}
<P>__{(putting ted's drink in front of him)}
<A>__{the waiter bustles away.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay, phyllis, what's up?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{kramer...}
<A>__{she breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on. then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(in a rush)}
<D>__{o'connor's out to get you. he's going to take the fire and ice account away from you.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what?!?}
<A>__{phyllis nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i don't believe it! that's crazy! why would jim do something like that?}
<A>__{phyllis polishes off the rest of ted's drink.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(angry herself)}
<D>__{you want to know why? i will tell you why...}
<P>__{(signaling to the waiter)}
<D>__{another scotch and soda for the gentleman.}
<P>__{(back to ted)}
<D>__{i will tell you exactly why. because you're not his buddy anymore. because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can't. i've got billy to take care of.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{you dope. o'connor doesn't give a damn about billy. all he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(stiff)}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<A>__{the waiter sets ted's drink on the table in front of him. he starts to reach for it, but phyllis is quicker.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(taking a stiff drink)}
<D>__{all right. okay. but tell me something, kramer. who do you think is palling around with o'connor these days?}
<A>__{ted shrugs.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{murray.}
<A>__{reaction, ted stunned, but trying to be nonchalant.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so... what's so terrible about that?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(would like to take}
<D>__{him by the shoulders and shake him until}
<P>__{his teeth rattle)}
<D>__{oh, for god's sake, kramer. you have got to be the world's most naive human being.}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire fire and ice campaign. every layout... every idea... every single thing, right down the line.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no. no, i don't believe it. jim o'connor would never let anything like that happen. he gave me my shot in this business. if it wasn't for jim o'connor i'd be i don't know where i'd be. he's a wonderful man...}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(apologetic for having upset ted)}
<D>__{kramer, i'm sorry. all i was trying to do was}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{i don't want to hear another word against him. not another word. he's a wonderful man... a wonderful man...}
