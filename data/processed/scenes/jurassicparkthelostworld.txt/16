<A>__{the african savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green, seen through night vision goggles. an animal yelp comes from the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it. the world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of long grass. the grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move stealthily through it. one animal head pops up above the grass for a split second, teeth bared, a white stripe between its eyes. sarah harding pulls the goggles away from her face.}

<D>__{hyenas. ace face is the striped snout.}
<A>__{sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the outdoors. she loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead of the hyenas to their prey. it's a herd of african buffalo, standing belly deep in the grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet. sarah turns to makena, her african assistant.}

<D>__{they'll try to take down a calf. come on.}
<C>__{makena}
<D>__{closer?}
<A>__{sarah scurries up and over a rock face. makena follows. closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running through it, trying to break it up.}
<C>__{makena }
<D>__{you know, we could see everything from up on the edge of that cliff.}

<A>__{while she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before her, sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action. makena follows, with growing unease.}

<D>__{dr. harding.}
<A>__{makena has a hold of sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her back, at least trying to slow down her progress as sarah, wide eyed with fascination, creeps even closer. suddenly there is a tremendous bellowing and the grass right in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf. they yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody. the adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come forward, squealing to get at the kill. sarah's eyes shine with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the tape recorder.}

<A>__{a telephone rings. sarah stops in mid sentence, unsure if she heard what she thought she heard. it rings again, the unmistakable chirping of a cellular phone. sarah and makena both move at once, pawing at a backpack.}

<D>__{i thought you turned it off!}
<A>__{two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone. sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{yes?!}
<A>__{someone speaks on the other end. sarah rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{ian. this better be important.}
<A>__{sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as the voice on the other end talks. and talks.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{when?}
