<L>__{interior funeral home. eliot's room early morning}
<A>__{darkness. a bright light comes on. close on a man's hands. turning slowly under a stream of crystal blue water. we pull back. eliot dries his hands. opens a cabinet. takes out a pair of latex gloves.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room early morning}
<A>__{a large room. tall vaulted ceilings. white tiles. soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. the room is silent. still. like a chapel. in the semi darkness we see a body on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. we hear a key turn in a lock. then another lock. the room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. eliot steps inside the room. he takes off his jacket. carefully places it on a coat hanger. puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. his every move meticulous. measured. like a ritual. eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. he looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... anna's body. pale and lifeless. an ugly gash above her eyebrow. cracked violet lips. a rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. she's only wearing one shoe. eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. places it inside a brown paper bag. eases off the shoe. picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. delicately slices open her dress. peels it off. he's about to cut the straps of her red slip when... anna opens her eyes. she looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. strangely eliot's not surprised. he calmly steps back. watches her carefully. anna's eyes slowly focus on eliot. she's groggy. confused.}

<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're in a funeral home.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're dead.}
<A>__{anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. she struggles to sit up but she can't even raise her head. her body stiff. rigid. eliot speaks to her calmly. soothingly.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you had a car accident. it was raining. you hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.}
<A>__{she looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in eliot's hand.}

<D>__{i'm not dead.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you were pronounced dead eight hours ago. your blood no longer circulates through your body. your brain cells are slowly dying. your body's already decomposing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm not dead.}
<A>__{eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. he places the bloodied dress on the trolley. then picks up a document. holds it up for her.}

<A>__{anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at eliot. he looks away. it pains him to see her so distressed.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley. wets it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{eliot delicately washes anna's face. she doesn't flinch as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't touch me! why are you touching me?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i'm preparing your body. you have to look beautiful for your funeral.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm not dead.}
<A>__{eliot sighs wearily. as if he'd had this conversation many times before.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you all say the same thing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. maybe you should rest now.}
<A>__{eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door. as he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and looks at anna for a moment.}
<B>__{on anna}
<A>__{the lights go off. o.s. the door clicks shut as it locks automatically behind eliot.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i can't be dead. it's just a nightmare. i will wake up soon. wake up.}
