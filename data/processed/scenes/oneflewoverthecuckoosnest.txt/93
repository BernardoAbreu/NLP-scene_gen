<A>__{as turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the plundering. the filing cabinet is open. so is the medicine cabinet. rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough syrup and orange juice are flowing. the patients start piling out of the room, carrying their plunder. fredrickson and sefelt are seen sitting on the floor, in front of the open refrigerator, looking through their dossiers.}
