<D>__{i never had a taste for any thing but genteel company, and hate all descriptions of low life. hence my account of the society in which i at present found myself must of necessity be short. the reminiscences of the horrid black hole of a place in which we soldiers were confined, of the wretched creatures with whom i was now forced to keep company, of the plowmen, poachers, pickpockets, who had taken refuge from poverty, or the law, as, in truth, i had done myself, is enough to make me ashamed even now.}
<A>__{roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess. when it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water. the beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning round to the messman and saying:}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{fellow, get me a glass!}
<A>__{at which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of laughter, the very loudest among them being mr. toole, a red haired monster of a man.}
<C>__{mr. toole}
<D>__{get the gentleman a towel for his hands, and serve him a basin of turtle soup.}
<A>__{roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly seizes roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst of another burst of applause.}

<D>__{if you want to vex him, ask him about his wife, the washerwoman, who bates him.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{is it a towel of your wife's washing, mr. toole? i'm told she wiped your face often with one. link boy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{ask him why he wouldn't see her yesterday, when she came to the ship.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{and so i put to him some other foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen pecking, and flat irons, which set the man into a fury, and succeeded in raising a quarrel between us.}
<A>__{roderick and toole fight with cudgels. roderick gives him a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the floor.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{this victory over the cock of the vile dunghill obtained me respect among the wretches among whom i formed part.}
