<A>__{the fly cam is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving simon the pov of a classic 3d driving game. he activates dynamic camera control with a gesture now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the camera forward, next to the driver's window... the camera looks to the side at kable, driving like he's on a mission to hell. simon barks in his head.}
