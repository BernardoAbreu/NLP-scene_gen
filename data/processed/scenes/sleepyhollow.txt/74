<L>__{interior van tassel house, ichabod's room night}
<A>__{in bed, ichabod opens tear filled eyes. he sits up, bringing his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks. his hands trail blood. he looks to them... the old scars are bleeding.}
<L>__{interior van tassel house, sitting room night}
<A>__{katrina comes to the door. ichabod is seated by the fire, eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{constable crane?}
<A>__{katrina comes beside ichabod's chair.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{allow me some time. i have spent every hour in the company of others. i need to be alone.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what troubles you?}
<A>__{she moves in front. ichabod gets up and crosses to sit facing away. katrina takes the chair he deserted.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{the things i said to you before... i was wrong to say them.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{no, actually, you were not. every word you spoke had truth in it.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what has happened?}
<A>__{ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{lady van tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? she bears so little resemblance.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{she is not your birth mother, is she?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{no, but... why do you ask that?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{what happened to your mother? is she still alive?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{she died. her lungs were diseased... two years ago. what is this about?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{memories have come back. i had them forgotten, and wish i could forget them again... but they are here now.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{lord, how i hate this place.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{if you want me to go, i will. do you want me to leave?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{i... i do not know. i no longer know what i think or what i feel.}
<A>__{katrina walks to him. she touches his back.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{why are you so afraid of that? is there truly such harm in uncertainty?}
<A>__{she kneels, smiles a little for him. she reaches to touch his face, holds his head in her hands. leans to kiss him. he rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms around her. they kiss passionately.}
