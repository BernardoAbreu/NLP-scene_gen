<L>__{interior william's bedroom night}
<A>__{the middle of the night. they are both asleep a yard apart. in sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then she wriggles across and re settles herself, tenderly, right next to him. he is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this all is.}
<L>__{interior william's bedroom day}
<A>__{the morning.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it still strikes me as, well, surreal, that i'm allowed to see you naked.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you and every person in this country.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh god yes i'm sorry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what is it about men and nudity? particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no seriously. i mean, they're just breasts. every second person in the world has got them...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{more than that actually, when you think about it. you know, meatloaf has a very nice pair...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but... they're odd looking. they're for milk. your mum's got them. you must have seen a thousand of them what's the fuss about?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{actually, i can't think really let me just have a quick look...}
<A>__{he looks under the sheet at her breasts.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, beats me.}
<A>__{she laughs...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{rita hayworth used to say 'they go to bed with gilda they wake up with me.' do you feel that?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{who was gilda?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(very touched)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{she looks at him carefully. then leaps out of bed.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i will be back.}
