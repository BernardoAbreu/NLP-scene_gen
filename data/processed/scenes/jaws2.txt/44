<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{long shot sand and whale from the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic. a few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the amity police boat. three ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them gesturing.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{angle on brody, hendricks and a woman she's lureen elkins, a marine biologist from the oceanographic institute, and she's skeptical. brody is the ant whose antennae were waving in the long shot.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{as soon as i heard about it, i called you. this thing is big!}
<A>__{his arms indicate big.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{after we've looked, we'll talk.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{this is it.}
<A>__{he moves forward to clear the crowd. some kids are poking the massive hulk with sticks. a tourist couple is snapping away with a polaroid sx 70. the whole mess stinks, too.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{move back, please... back off... open it up a little...}
<A>__{the crowd edges back, giving way to brody and elkins.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{see? what'd i tell you?}
<B>__{angle on the whale}
<A>__{brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{look at that!}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{first things first.}
<A>__{she produces a tape measure and gives one end to brody.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{from the tip of the snout, please.}
<A>__{elkins is measuring the length of the creature. she calls off numbers to hendricks, who is officiously writing it all down, repeating numbers as he hears them.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{length, 22 feet, 8 inches.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{come on, let's check the bite radius.}
<C>__{elkins}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{bite radius. you know, the size of the mouth?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{the whale's mouth?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{the shark's mouth.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{what shark?}
<A>__{brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{the shark that did this. it was a shark, wasn't it?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{we don't know that, do we?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{but that's what we're here to find out, right?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{you don't tell me my job, and i won't tell you about yours, okay?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{i can't hear you if you're going to whisper.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{can we go now?}
<A>__{he turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to return to their blanket, ad libbing good byes.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{you stay here a minute.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh, c'mon.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we'll be over by the lighthouse.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will be right there. wait up.}
<A>__{they hang around, waiting for him. elkins has reclaimed brody's attention.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{could be a shark. but maybe not.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{look, i know a little bit about sharks.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i know that this was probably a great white shark. car cadon... caradan...}
<A>__{he fumbles for the correct latin.}
<C>__{elkins}
<P>__{(helping out)}
<D>__{carcharadon carcharias.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{okay, so that's it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{is there one in these waters?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{what makes you think there might be?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish...}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{this is a mammal, not a fish.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{jesus, don't quibble with me. i want to know if a great white shark did this.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's it? probably? look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around...}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{and sound.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(this is a new one)}
<D>__{sound?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{sound. like sonar, or radar. they home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low frequency vibration.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{so there's one around here.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{not necessarily. these wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. none of them are immediately fatal. currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<P>__{(chiming in)}
<D>__{we got a helluva tide this month.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{could you just keep that crowd back, please?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(fidgeting)}
<D>__{pop...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you stay right here. you're going in with me.}
<B>__{angle on brody and mike}
<A>__{as elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to hendricks.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we came out in my boat.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{andy can sail in it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i got a date!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{she'll understand.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{she won't.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks...}
<A>__{the kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on between father and son.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i don't want to discuss it.}
<A>__{elkins crosses to brody.}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{it's either a great white, or another killer whale.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{can't you tell?}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{not when it's like this. this animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{look can great white sharks communicate? send out signals, or something? you know, take revenge, sense an enemy...}
<C>__{elkins}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous sharks don't take things personally.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{dad, please...}
<A>__{brody turns on him. this at least, is something he can do something about.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no more sailing. you come back with me, and that's it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{because i say so.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i will tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{see you later, mikey...}
<C>__{ed and tina}
<D>__{later, bye...}
