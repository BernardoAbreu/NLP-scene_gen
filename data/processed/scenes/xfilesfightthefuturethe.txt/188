<T>__{cut back to:}
<L>__{interior lower ribbed corridor continuous agent mulder}
<A>__{back on his feet, smashing now at the crust of brittle blue ice that encases scully. bashing, smashing and then finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that exposes scully's face and shoulder. watery aqua tinted liquid drains from her mouth and nose. but scully is not conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive, her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.}
<B>__{over mulder to scully}
<A>__{as he plunges the needle into scully's arm at the front of her shoulder. to which there is an immediate reaction as if given a shot of adrenalin. her eyes blinking away the cold moisture.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully }
<A>__{scully's lips move goldfish like as she tries to suck in air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a swimmer who's been held under too long. but no words are coming out yet.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{breathe can you breathe?!}
<A>__{scully is straining to do just that when liquid suddenly spews from scully's mouth. and she begins to cough and gag taking big gulps of air as her eyes focus on mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle. finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths that mulder cannot discern.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{close on mulder and scully}
<A>__{as he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth. as the softest sound comes out in scully's frosty breath.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{cold...}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{hang on. i'm going to get you out of here.}
<A>__{as she continues to suck air.}
