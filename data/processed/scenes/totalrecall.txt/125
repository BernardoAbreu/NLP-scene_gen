<L>__{interior vehicle day}
<A>__{the vehicle had just stopped.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{bennie, don't stop now, take it...}
<A>__{he turns to see bennie is covering him and melina with a pistol.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{you bastard.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{like i said. it's a tough planet. i'm a baddie, not a goodie.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i should have known, you were just too helpful.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{eio rule one, man. trust nobody. now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{but what about the martian people? out cause? i thought you believed in it.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{your cause? that bunch of dead beat radicals! when i hand in this little number...}
<P>__{(flicks his gun in quail's face)}
<D>__{...i will get real estate rights on the whole of chryse planitia...}
<A>__{at that instant, melina lunges, punches a red emergency button. the vent beside bennie's hand blows open, [causing] a powerful suction caused by mars's vacuum atmosphere. bennie's gun hand is planted against the vent [opening.] simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out! all three parties begin choking. as bennie's mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, quail has a moment to jump him. he pounds bennie's gun hand, the pistol is sucked, clattering, out the vent! quail delivers a roundhouse punch to bennie, knocking him clear across the bus. melina seals the vent, repressurizes the cabin. bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off quail's punch }
