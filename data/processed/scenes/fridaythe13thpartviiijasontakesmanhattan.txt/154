<L>__{exterior gang banger's lair night}
<A>__{it's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit brownstones with shattered chicken wire windows, moss growing on the bricks. the gang bangers appear with rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.}
<D>__{gang banger #l welcome to the casbah, princess.}
<A>__{pan around with them as they walk through a thick blanket of steam which pours out of a factory vent. we move through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. a spool once used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. they splash through puddles, throwing her down on the couch.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{ looking back at the steam vent. jason appears in the}
<B>__{billowing mist.}
<A>__{close up syringe as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. widen to find gang banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, his compadre holding a squirming rennie down on the couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{please don't... gang banger #1 loosen up, baby. it'll feel way better if you're stoned.}
<A>__{close on jason's feet same time amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded syringe. jason picks it up. closer angle couch just as gang banger #2 jabs rennie with the needle. gang banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, pushing rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his friend watches excitedly.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 slang us some more 'caine, jojo. we're in for a long night.}
<A>__{gang banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. rennie spits in his face. he hesitates not in slapping}
<B>__{her hard.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 it's your parade, princess. can be smooth or can be rough. your choice.}
<A>__{she closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to happen.}
<D>__{gang banger #1 i think i'm in love.}
<A>__{push in on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his lips toward her chest. just before contact he grunts thickly, his eyes bugging out.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{jason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame. he thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. jason goes for number three and: close up gang banger #1's chest (efx) jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the needle sticking out his front side.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth. he collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of jason towering over her. at the same time: gang banger #2 comes around the corner.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 forgot my money, holmes...}
<A>__{ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of jason.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 who the fuck are you?}
<A>__{jason paces toward him. the kid glances at his dead friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his .38.}
<D>__{gang banger #2 you're dead, fuckhead.}
<A>__{bang! ...but jason keeps on coming. five shots later and jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball and shoving him head first into the mossy brick wall. the kid falls in a bloody heap.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{shoves gang banger #1 off of her as jason returns his attention to her. she grabs a loose brick and flings it at him, cracking his hockey mask, momentarily disorienting him. rennie sprints away.}
