<A>__{a muzak cover of 'broke, busted, and disgusted' plays in the background as theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the microwave oven. alfie, the rickety old man who runs the store, shuffles up to the self serve island and begins wiping it down. theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises. he pulls a disgusted grimace. alfie pours himself a cup of coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half & half. because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes everywhere but into the coffee.}
