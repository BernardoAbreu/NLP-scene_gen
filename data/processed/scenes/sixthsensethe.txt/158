<L>__{interior girl's bedroom afternoon}
<A>__{cole closes the door behind him. he turns and gazes at the girl's bedroom. there's a hospital bed near the window. the walls are covered with get well cards and drawings from family, friends, and school children. her shelves are filled with puppets. all shapes and sizes of puppets. next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod sitting next to it. cole walks to the shelf and picks up a finger puppet dancer. he places it in his pocket. on the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes. the labels read, "puppet show christmas 96," "puppet show birthday party," "puppet show class trip"... cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the closets. he passes the bed.}
<B>__{an emaciated hand reaches out from beneath the bed and grabs}
<A>__{cole's ankle. cole jerks back startled. he watches as the girl's hand slips back under the bed. cole stays very still. waits. nothing happens. he slowly bends down. his hands touch the floor. he tilts his head and looks under the bed. the emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the floor. her bulging eyes glare at cole. she moves suddenly. thrusts a jewelry box forward. it slides across the wooden floor and stops just before cole. cole and the sickly girl stare at each other. neither of them say a word.}
