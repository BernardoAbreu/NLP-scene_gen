<A>__{cortez reaches the top platform. now he's faced with... the high poles. he's seen others land sideways and pay the price. trying another way, cortez takes a flying leap... and whumps down with legs astraddle. he tried to cushion the landing with his hands and failed magnificently. his balls took the brunt. jordan whumps down beside him with legs astraddle and shoots cortez a "hey, no problem" look. she rolls off the poles... and drops to the pit below. cortez lands right behind. now it's a flat out sprint for... the finish line. he takes her at the tape.}
