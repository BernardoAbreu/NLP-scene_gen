<L>__{interior charlie's office day}
<A>__{charlie is dressed to go somewhere. she looks much nicer in these clothes than in her show garments of the night. she is listening to prince who sits in a chair, the inevitable dice in his fingers, two this time. there is a silence except the rattle of the cubes. then prince speaks coldly.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{does this haven move me out? is that the plan?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{prince, you know i wouldn't part with you.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{but i always come up empty.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not quite empty. i gave you what is probably the one honest feeling you ever had in your life.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{i keep forgetting that. pardon me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's the matter, prince?}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{i don't like john haven or anything about him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you've said that.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{what do you know about him?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you want me to have him looked up in the social register?}
<A>__{she gets up, goes to the window testily. prince looks at her coldly as she gazes at the street.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{a man walks in out of nowhere }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{and went against your table. did he play like a gambler?}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{he knew something.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes and he took mick.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{so he can fight.}
<P>__{(shrewdly)}
<D>__{you like that part, don't you?}
<A>__{he looks straight at her and she stares back, staring him down at last. as his eyes lower, she turns again to the window.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will tell you one thing, prince, i don't like this part.}
<A>__{she is silent and prince gets up and walks out. she does not turn. down in the street she can see haven riding up in the buggy, and the hard look on her face softens to a smile as haven climbs out of the buggy. some people passing stare at him, and whisper together. his fame has spread. he walks inside, smiling a little.}
