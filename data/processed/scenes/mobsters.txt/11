<L>__{exterior lower east side residential street day super: 1916}
<A>__{frank costello, now sixteen, sits on a stoop across from p.s. 34, as the younger kids pass on their way to school. occasionally one will break from the stream of traffic and place a penny in frank's outstretched palm. a boy in a yarmulke hands frank a penny and whispers to him.}
<B>__{frank stares across the street}
<A>__{at a group of irish boys gathered around mike shane, red haired and a head taller than the others. frank nods and gives the boy a reassuring pat on the back. as the school bell rings, the boy joins the others rushing into the building, leaving frank and the irish gang alone on opposite sides of the street. two jewish boys younger than frank and small in stature, come casually along the sidewalk, unconcerned with getting to class on time. meyer lansky has the bookish demeanor of a yeshiva boy. bugsy siegel, an almost comically cocky strut. costello calls to them as they pass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, fellas. ya know them micks over there don't like no heebs.}

<D>__{yeah. well we don't sell protection ta assholes anyhow.}
<A>__{siegel moves right into costello's face, swinging fiercely. lansky shouts encouragement, as the startled costello falls back onto the stoop.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{kick him in the balls!}
<A>__{a pair of arms grab siegel and pull him off costello.}
<B>__{charlie luciano shakes his head}
<A>__{as he holds the kicking and punching siegel in mid air like a helpless snapping turtle.}
<C>__{luciano}
