<L>__{interior ceo's executive boardroom continuous}
<A>__{they come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city. it is filled with people along one side of the table. there are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all. on the near side of the table sits ramesh shah surrounded by empty chairs all alone. the head of the table is empty. they all file in and sit down. they all sit in silence... waiting. finally from a side door john tuld comes walking into the room. he is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head. he carries himself without much exception. his eyes however tell a far different tale. intense even at rest. he walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{please sit down.}
<A>__{he then seats himself at the head of the table. everyone in the room has the printout in front of them. jared is seated immediately to his left, then sam, then sarah, ramesh, will, peter, and finally seth.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{welcome everyone. i must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what i've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago...}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{but that is spilt milk under the bridge. so why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here?}
<A>__{everyone looks around the room a bit and finally jared speaks up.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{well, mr. tuld as i mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout...}
<A>__{he cuts him off.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in english? ... actually i'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... mr. sullivan is it? does he speak english?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{well, that's peter sullivan here.}
<A>__{jared looks down the table to peter, as does everyone else in the room. jared gives him a go ahead look.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{ah, there he is.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{how old are you mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm twenty seven sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{please call me john.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so mr. sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, i didn't get here on my brains i can assure you of that.}
<A>__{peter is very nervous.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, sir. as i guess you may or may not know i work for mr. rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at mbs}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{now you lost me at m...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sorry...}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i was joking mr. sullivan.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes... well as you probably know over the last 36 40 months the firm has begun packaging new mbs products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. this has been very profitable as i imagine you noticed.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. the problem, which is i guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpointerior}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and mr. sullivan that challenge is?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and how far have we pushed that profile tonight mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we have pushed it to 1.215 trillion dollars... at mbs alone.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{now mr. sullivan what i am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what i am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so what you're saying is it's already happened?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{and mr. sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, that's where it becomes a projection. but...}
<A>__{peter looks down at jared for approval to go forward.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{you're speaking with me mr. sullivan.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.}
<A>__{the room goes silent. john tuld looks at peter long and hard. he then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into the city.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so what you're telling me mr. sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism?}
<A>__{everyone looks back at peter.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{mr. sullivan?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well sir, i'm not sure i'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. it would be considerably worse.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{well let me tell you something mr. sullivan. do you want to know why i'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why i get the big bucks, so to speak?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i'm here for one reason and one reason only.}
<A>__{john tuld continues to look out over the city for a long beat.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{i'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now. that's it, nothing more....... and i'm afraid... standing here tonight... that i don't hear... a... thing... just silence.}
<A>__{the room falls completely still for at least half a minute. then john tuld spins around quickly with a considerably more upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{so, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it?}
<A>__{long silence.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{mr. cohen, ms. robertson, i'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in. lord knows we relied enough on mr. sullivan today.}
<A>__{jared and sarah come to attention and gather their thoughts.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{what have you got for us?}
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{what have i told you since the first day you walked into my office? (pause) that there are three ways to make a living in this business... be first, be smarter, or cheat. well i don't cheat, and even though i like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.}
<A>__{the room goes silent again as mr. tuld stares back out the window.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{sell it all today...}
<A>__{john tuld smiles just a bit. then turns.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{is that even possible sam?}
<A>__{sam looks across the room at john tuld, they have known each other for 35 years.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{it is, but at what cost?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i will pay.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{john and sam look and read each other.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{almost a trillion bucks of paper?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{where does it come back to us?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{everywhere.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{sam, i don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if i made you... how would you do it?}
<A>__{sam rogers looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{you bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. you'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. no swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{ramesh?}
<A>__{he looks to ramesh shah down the table.}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{they'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. they can't stop you.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{john... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{the same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.}
<A>__{they look at each other to see if they understand each other.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{if you do this you've killed that market for years. it's over.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<P>__{(nods.)}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{and you are selling something you know has no value.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<P>__{(cuts him off cold)}
<D>__{we are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that we may survive, sam.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{you'll never sell a thing to any one of them again.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{do you!!! this is it, sam, this is it!}
<A>__{the rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it. silence.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{it's 4:00... jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{is there anyone else who actually knows what's in there right now, block by block?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{eric dale.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{where is eric dale?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{as of today he is no longer with the firm.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{we have been trying to locate him.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{so he is just out there with this information?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<P>__{(nods yes.)}
<A>__{john tuld looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret service looking guy.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{carmelo?}
<C>__{louis carmelo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{get me eric dale here by 6:30.}
<C>__{louis carmelo}
<D>__{done.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{ok, meet back here in an hour.}
<A>__{everyone stands up and begins to scatter.}
<C>__{john tuld }
<D>__{sam... let's talk.}
<A>__{john tuld leads sam through the back door.}
