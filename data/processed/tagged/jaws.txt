<L>__{exterior beach night another angle}
<A>__{around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota spanish leather wine bag much in favor by beach and ski bum types. the group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing eastern ivy league anthems dartmouth, cornell, harvard, penn, etc. two young people break away from the others. they are tom cassidy and chrissie. behind them, there is considerable necking activity; tom and chrissie are more serious.}

<L>__{exterior another part of the beach night}
<A>__{tom and chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is plodding along in the sand, winded. chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, leaving tom reeling atop the dune. as she runs, she is shedding her clothes. tom is trying to trail her by her clothes, like hansel following bread crumbs through the woods. but chrissie is way ahead of him.}
<C>__{chrissie}
<D>__{c'mon!}
<A>__{she runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly into the water with a light "whoops!" as the cold water sweeps over her. behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery chorus of alma maters. then we see it a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that passes her a dozen feet away. a pressure wave lifts her up, then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.}
<C>__{chrissie}
<D>__{tommy? don't dunk me...}

<A>__{her expression freezes. the water bulge is racing towards her. the first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to her hips. she reaches under water to touch her leg. whatever she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking off any scream she might try to make. another jolt to her body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the surface. then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible jerking motion. hold on the eddies and swirls until we're sure it's all over.}

<A>__{in his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from a tight sleeve. as he turns, we hear the alma maters in the background, from the fire.}
