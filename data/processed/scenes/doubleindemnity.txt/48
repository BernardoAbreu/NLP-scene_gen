<D>__{i made sure nobody saw me go into your office.}
<A>__{d 16 keyes' office (day) neff has just come in. he goes over to keyes' desk and searches the papers on it. he tries the desk drawers and finds them locked. his eye falls on the dictaphone on the stand beside the desk. a record is on it, the needle is about two thirds of the way towards the end. he lifts the needle and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the switch to playback position. he lifts the arm off the bracket and starts the machine. keyes' voice is heard coming from the horn:}

<D>__{memo to mr. norton. confidential. dietrichson file. with regard to your proposal to put walter neff under surveillance, i disagree absolutely. i have investigated his movements on the night of the crime, and he is definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 p.m. on. in addition to this, i have known neff intimately for eleven years, and i personally vouch for him, without reservation...}
<A>__{neff stops the machine. he sits down slowly, still holding the horn. he is deeply moved. after a moment, he presses the switch again.}

<P>__{(from dictaphone)}
<D>__{...furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established between walter neff and mrs. phyllis dietrichson, whereas i am now able to report that such a connection has been established between her and another man. this man has been observed to visit the dietrichson home on the night of july 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th. we have succeeded in identifying him as one nino zachetti, former medical student, aged twenty eight, residing at lilac court apartments 122812 n. la brea avenue. we have checked zachetti's movements on the night of the crime and have found that they cannot be accounted for. i am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration and it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against zachetti and mrs. dietrichson to justify police action. i strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office of the district attorney. respectfully, barton keyes.}
<A>__{neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. the cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes only the whir of the needle on the empty record. at last he remembers to replace the horn. he hangs it back on its hook. the machine stops. neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and goes out. d 17 12th floor, balcony neff has just come out of keyes' office. he walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors. all the employees have now left. neff is entirely alone. he moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea. he turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters. d 18 neff's office (day) neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials a number. (during the ensuing telephone conversation, only what he says is heard. the pauses indicate speeches at the other end of the line).}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{phyllis? walter. i've got to see you... tonight... yes, it has to be tonight... how's eleven o'clock? don't worry about keyes. he's satisfied... leave the door on the latch and put the lights out. no, nobody's watching the house... i told you keyes is satisfied. it's just for the neighbors... that's what i said. yeah. eleven o'clock. goodbye, baby.}
<A>__{neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. the gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder. over his face comes the commentary.}
