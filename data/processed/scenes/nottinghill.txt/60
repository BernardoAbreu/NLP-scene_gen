<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{jeff drifts into view behind. he is a very famous film star and looks the part well built, very handsome. unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says. over a t shirt, he wears a shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.}

<C>__{william}

<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{and maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{and he does just that. scoops up the two used plates and heads to the bin.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really don't do that i'm sure this is not his job.}
