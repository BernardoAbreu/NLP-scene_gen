<A>__{adam paces. then helen comes out. behind her, we can see calvin sleeping in his bed. she heads for the living room. he follows.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he seems to be doing all right now. i don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. but we need supplies and i've got to stay with him.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i will go up.}
<A>__{they go through the living room and cross to the patio.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm afraid you've got to.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i will be all right.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(patting his cheek)}
<D>__{you're my brave boy.}
<A>__{helen hands him a pencil and pad. adam follows her to the fish farm.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{just act normal. if anybody asks, simply say you're from out of town, and that you're in town on business. write that down.}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{i'm going to give you a shopping list and some money. we need just enough things to get us through the next year or two. and you'll find most of these items at what used to be called a grocery store or a hardware store. write that down.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{at the fish tank, helen pulls up a slim chain that is attached to a water tight aluminum box which she quickly opens. the box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred dollar bills. helen takes half of it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, i want you to look for something called a holiday inn. write that down. it's a hotel. there might still be one standing.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{let's get you packed.}
<A>__{she heads back for the house. he follows.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(indicating money)}
<D>__{i just hope this is still good up there.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i was thinking that, uh...you know, while i was up there and all...that maybe i could, you know...try to meet a girl. i've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.}
<A>__{they have stopped by the garden.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{they hug.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, there's also a thing called a liquor store. write that down.}
