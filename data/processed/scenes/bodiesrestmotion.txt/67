<A>__{nick turns the radio off. he fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray. he takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat. he stares at the road. he looks down to the front seat and finds the map. he splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map. the wind catches the map. the map billows up, covering his face. losing control of the car, nick slaps it down. a car horn blares. nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down again, and pulls off to the side of the road. he stops the car and slams the shift into park. he opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. he smooths out the map on the dashboard. billings and enfield are marked with carol's big red circles. close up the map nick's finger traces from enfield toward billings along the route carol highlighted with the red felt tip. halfway to billings, the red line stops. nick's finger stops.}
