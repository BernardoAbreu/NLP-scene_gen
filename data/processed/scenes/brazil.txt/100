<A>__{sam steps out of room 5001, newly suited with old suit over arm. two guards are guiding a baggee down the corridor ahead of him. suddenly, the baggee breaks away from his guards and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly at sam. sam is flattened against the wall as the baggee rockets by.}

<L>__{interior lift day}
<A>__{slightly unnerved, sam gets in the lift, pushes the button for his floor the 30th and immediately begins perusing jill's dossier. the lift descends. but unnoticed by sam continued past his floor without stopping. it stops at the lobby mezzanine. sam looks up and realizes he is on the wrong floor. angrily he pushes the correct floor number but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice echoing through the massive lobby. he looks in the direction of the porters desk. there stands jill arguing with the porter.}

<D>__{but you've stamped this form before! why won't you stamp it now?}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{you've just said yourself, miss, we've already stamped it. why should we stamp it twice?}
<A>__{sam is frozen. he can't believe what he sees. the lift doors close. sam is too slow to stop them. madly he pushes the buttons to no effect. the lift descends. (at this point we had better describe the lift. it is a cross between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille doors and the super sleek modern lifts that rise and fall in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the ministry.) sam can see jill and if jill were to look up she could see sam descending. he is shouting and rattling the bars of the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention. sam sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying to stop the demon lift. from his pov we see jill disappearing from view still arguing with the porter.}
