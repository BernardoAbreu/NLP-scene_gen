<L>__{exterior terrain near termite stump night}
<A>__{z looks up to see...looming high above them...the termite city, which is built in the stump of a dead tree. from here it looks like a demonic mount fuji. the colonel ant shouts an order.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{attaaaaaaaaack!!!}
<A>__{the front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony...z is swept along...}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{over the tooooooooooooo op!!!}
<A>__{z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance. up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very middle of the termite colony... into a disquietingly peaceful scene. they're in the middle of the hollowed out trunk, and ants keep pouring in but there's not a termite to be seen. barbatus looks around suspiciously.}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{it's too damn quiet.}
<A>__{then we hear a strange tapping noise. barbatus looks over, and sees that z's teeth are chattering with fear.}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{don't be scared, kid. barbatus's got yer back.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(petrified)}
<D>__{maybe they went out for the evening. let's leave them a message and head home.}
<C>__{colonel}
<P>__{(ignoring him)light it up!}
<A>__{a nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack andpinches him. the firefly, yelling "yipe! yipe! yipe!", shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of the stump with eery, shifting luminescence. then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the stump...and, with an unearthly roar, we see the first ofhundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree, right onto the ant army.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{they're here!!!}
<C>__{barbatus}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{keep your head down!}
<A>__{within moments, z finds himself in the middle of abloodbath. the ants have broken into the colony, but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid spewing termites. the battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of braveheart. in a few quick shots from z's perspective, we see: a squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead... a termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and ispulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds... another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{guys! guys! it isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over!}
<A>__{just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face z. z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling monstrosity.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait! please! acid makes me come out in spots! could i just say i have always had the greatest respect for your species? i mean, eating wood why didn't i think of that? i }
<A>__{the termite rears, getting ready to melt z, when oof! he's knocked backwards by...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{barbatus! you you saved my life!}
<C>__{barbatus}
<D>__{don't get all sappy about it!}
<A>__{as barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the colonel strides up to z, puffing on a cigar.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{i love the smell of formic acid in the morning.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{a stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still burning cigar; z's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites rumbling towards them. z, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made...}
