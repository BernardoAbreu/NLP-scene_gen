<L>__{exterior zoo day}
<A>__{michael and julianne walking together. he's eating his popcorn. she carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle cone, and a large drink.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're not eating.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i never eat when i'm serene.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you never eat when you're despondent.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i switched that around when you weren't looking.}
<A>__{she swirls a single nacho chip in cheese. but her heart isn't in it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{last zoo we were in was... beijing, yeah? sure. the rhinos were fucking.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{boy, those were the days.}
<A>__{and when she looks over. his eyes are waiting.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yeah, they were.}
<A>__{they're passing the hippo pen. but they don't notice.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that was nice. the way you said that.}
<A>__{so was that. he's feeling restless, something. doesn't know quite what to say.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's weird being the groom. all these things kimmy has to take care of...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you need a baby sitter. that's what i'm here for.}
<A>__{he holds her eyes. then looks down. awkward. and the way he's doing it begins to excite her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{say it.}
<A>__{he looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is about to... ... crash into a chest high metal stand that displays animal facts. we have followed him as she is wiped from frame. his face from shock... to amusement.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{now, there's my girl.}
<A>__{... to tenderness. pan back to see her wearing everything from her cardboard container. nachos, fudge sauce, diet coke, the works. it is really awful. kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly. her eyes fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see, i can only do it with beer.}
<A>__{he takes out his handkerchief. and with that and his hands, gently scoops the worst of the mess off her. the fact that he's touching her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice. she laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't know why. such an odd, raw, confusing moment. to the world looking on, they are lovers.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{see, better already.}
<A>__{and he kisses her face. not quite her lips. but only an inch away. we can feel her heart pounding. he strips off his shirt, only a tank top underneath.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we'll go back to the bathroom, you'll put this on...}
<A>__{okay? she sniffles, okay. swallows.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{bet you're glad i'm here to take care of you.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{bet i am.}
<A>__{holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hope that crazy person's not still there.}
<A>__{we're on their backs...}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{she doesn't scare me.}
