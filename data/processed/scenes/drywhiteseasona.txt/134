<L>__{exterior street in vrededorp morning}
<A>__{vrededorp is a colored section of johannesburg. it's rundown area vacated by whites. there are children play ing in the street. some unemployed men are sitting on old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two women from his milk churn. ben drives into the street searching for an address. he stops outside a house. as he gets out of the car the children and everyone stop to look at him with interest. he walks up to a door and knocks. a colored woman appears as the door opens. she is young and obviously educated.}
<C>__{colored woman}
<D>__{mr. du toit?}
<A>__{ben nods, hesitatingly.}
<C>__{colored woman}
<D>__{please, come in.}
<A>__{ben walks into the living dining room. it's a very tidy room with a three piece sitting room suite, a sideboard with a clock on it. at one end of the room is the dining area. the floor is linoleum and covered with a rug in the middle. stanley is lounging on a settee, beer in hand. on the chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit, drinks orange squash. thirtyish, pleasant face but very tense. he rises as ben walks in.}

<D>__{a beer would be nice.}
<A>__{sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer and a glass. she opens the beer and hands it to ben. she disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the door.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you know they call this place vrededorp, but we baptize it malay camp. your first time in malay camp, lanie?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i've driven through here many times.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{alright, let's get on with it. stanley tells me, you work at john vorster square.}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{i had no choice, they transferred me there.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yet you smuggled out letters to emily?}
<C>__{seroke}
<P>__{(pulling the fingers}
<D>__{of his left hand one by one cracking the}
<P>__{joints over and over)}
<D>__{what do you do if a man asks you, and he's in trouble?}
<C>__{stanley}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know that. tell me, what do you know about gordon?}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{very little.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you did talk to him from time to time?}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{he gave me the letters.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{when was the last time you saw him?}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{just before he died.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did you attend any of the interrogations?}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{no. i'm not a member of the special branch. but once i had to deliver a letter to capt. stolz, gordon was there.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{how were they interrogating him?}
<A>__{seroke hesitates and looks at stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it's okay. tell him what you told me.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{they were using the pole.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the pole, what's that?}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(demonstrating)}
<D>__{they handcuff you and manacle your feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees. then you're like a chicken ready for the oven. they hang you between two tables. then they do what they like with you. the s.b. call it the aeroplane.}
<A>__{ben is horrified.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i see. who were in that room? stolz...}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{lieutenant venter and a black s.b.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you are sure?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{he's sure.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{it's very interesting. when was the last time you saw him?}
<C>__{seroke}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i saw them take the body away to the cells. he was limp.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you did! johnson, why do you stay with the police? you don't really belong there.}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{it's a job. and how can i go away? i love my family.}
<A>__{he jumps up and faces ben with a look of anger and panic.}
<C>__{seroke}
<D>__{they must never know i told you anything. right?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i understand. i promise.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{this is strictly between the three of us. don't worry, man.}
<A>__{seroke shakes hands with them as he's leaving.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(slapping his back)}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<A>__{stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{a beer, lanie?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{no, thank you. you know, stanley, after what happened the other night i was about to give this whole thing up.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{what happened, man?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my wife nearly got killed. three shots were fired into the house. what right have i to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger? that's what i asked myself.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like stolz, and say 'i give up.' what is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life. shit, i thought you had more guts than this, man!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i didn't say i'm giving up.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{but you thought about it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{johnson has revived my determination.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it's a hell of a time, lanie, but we'll survive. you and me. i tell you!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you think we may still win in the end, stanley?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{of course not, lanie but we needn't lose either what matters is to stick around.}
<A>__{ben nods.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{by the way, man, i'm off on a trip botswana thought i'd tell you in case you get worried.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why are you going there?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{business. tell you next week. now for the bad news i've been saving to the last.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{julius has been arrested. he broke his banning order and visited his sister. you know what that means? at least a year's imprisonment.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a year in jail just for visiting his sister?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{that's the chance he took. and he'll be the last to complain.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{so what? lanie, you're not getting guilt complexes now, are you? that's a luxury only liberals can afford. julius will be back, man. all refreshed by a spell in the deep freeze.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how can we shrug off a man we've been working with?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{who said we're shrugging him off? best way of remembering a man, lanie, is to carry on fighting.}
