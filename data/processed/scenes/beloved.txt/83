<L>__{exterior porch. early evening.}
<A>__{paul approaches sethe, touching her gently.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i didn't mean to tell you that.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i didn't plan on hearing it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't take it back but i can leave it alone.}
<A>__{sethe, instead of collapsing from the information, she seems hardened.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let's do that..let's leave it alone now.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(more to herself)}
<D>__{let it alone. just sit down and leave it be! yeah that would be nice. would be even nicer to lose it altogether if i had my choice. halle did. other people's brains stopped, went crazy. how sweet that would have been. me and halle squatting by that churn, smashing cold lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in the world..}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sethe, don't do this..}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{what a relief to just stop it all right there, huh?!! close it shut! squeeze that butter...but i had three children on their way to ohio and nothing would have changed that! and you tell me he didn't leave me!!}
<A>__{sethe exits o.s. paul is left alone on the porch until beloved runs out of the house giggling with denver in pursuit. as denver passes, paul sarcastically remarks;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{guess she's feeling better, huh?}
<A>__{denver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues after beloved. the two girls run towards the woods.}
