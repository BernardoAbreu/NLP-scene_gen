<A>__{the figures in the corn look up we hear an aircraft approach with a jet whine fwoom! a massive concussion as a bunker busting missile bores into the earth at high velocity, burrowing deep then a huge blast flame and dirt are thrown high in the air, many of the figures blown sky high. a flaming body hits the ground in fg, face to camera... we now see it was a steel terminator its metal skull blown open and scorched, its red eyes shattered. a 10 warthogs stubby attack planes scream from the sky, raking the remaining figures with cannon fire, blasting them to bits. these aircraft no longer bear traditional u.s. insignia they're painted in wild colors, graffiti lettering says things like: "bot blaster," "kill for connor," "rage against the machines," etc... resistance fighters. motley military and civilian choppers land in the cornfield, disgorging resistance soldiers. these are human troops in high tech helmets, carrying slightly futuristic conventional}

<A>__{the warthogs veer off, laying napalm in the distance behind the soldiers. the troops run toward an opening which has been blown into the ground, the remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker buster hit. a surviving terminator rises from the singed corn, fires its plasma rifle dropping a soldier. his comrades fire explosive bullets and blow the robot apart. the leader of this assault group waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.}
