<L>__{interior cabin twelve (day)}
<A>__{lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from the window of this cabin. she turns, frustrated, anxious. sam is standing at the foot of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased in a sadness.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{we should have asked for cabin one... the one mary was in.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm glad we didn't.}
<A>__{he pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits wearily, lights a cigarette. lila watches him for a moment, feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, turns again and looks at sam's back.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{we have to go into that cabin and search it, sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{do you think if something happened, it happened there?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a pause, then:)}
<D>__{sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?}
<P>__{(as sam studies her)}
<D>__{forty thousand dollars?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how could we prove...}
<P>__{(an almost hopeless laugh)}
<D>__{well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{there must be some proof that exists right now! something that proves he got that money away from mary... some way!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what makes you sound so certain?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{arbogast! sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. i heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. he wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us. unless he was stopped. and he was stopped, so he must have found out something!}
<A>__{sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we'll start with cabin one.}
<A>__{he goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, back to lila:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{if he sees us... we're just taking the air.}
<A>__{lila goes to the door. he holds it open and she goes out.}
