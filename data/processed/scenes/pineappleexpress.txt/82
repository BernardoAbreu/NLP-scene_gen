<L>__{int exterior red's car night}
<A>__{dale and red are in red's car, a ford fiesta, driving through the countryside. dale stops the car 100 yards from the barn.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{this is awesome! we're so gonna show those motherfuckers. think they can kill me? fuck no, you can't! not how i roll.}
<A>__{red gets out and walks to the drivers side. dale gets out, gun in hand. red gets in the drivers seat.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{so, this is the backside of the farm. if you stay low in the grass you should be fine. if someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. it makes you harder to hit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you're not coming to help?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{fuck no! i've been shot. by these guys. i was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, i should get to the hospital. you saw reservoir dogs, right? i got shot in the best spot possible. i could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. full of possibilities. go get `em, slugger.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{but how do i get out of here if i rescue saul?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i've no idea. i'm sure it won't be that hard. kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. good luck, amigo!}
<A>__{red drives off. dale takes a deep breath, clenches his gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. he checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to fight. dale sneaks up on the building and pears in between two boards. he sees budlofsky supervising as the thugs load the van.}
