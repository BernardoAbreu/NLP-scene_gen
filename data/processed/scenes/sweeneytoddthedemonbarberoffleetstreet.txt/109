<D>__{don't worry, darling, in those clothes, no one will recognize you ... you're safe now.}

<A>__{she looks at him very intensely:}
<C>__{johanna}
<D>__{no, anthony, they never go away.}
<A>__{he gently touches her face.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i will be right back to you ... half an hour and we'll be free.}
<A>__{he goes. she turns to the window, watches him go. her expression is sad: he will never fully comprehend her depth. then she sees the beggar woman approaching from across the street...}
