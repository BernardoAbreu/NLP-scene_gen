<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a new york lunch club or executive dining room. from the window we have a towering view of the city. four men in their 50's to 70's old men, rich men, talk at a quiet table. their figures are shadowy and we overhear their conversation obliquely, across faces flared out by sun bouncing off the skyscraper window.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{one worried sonofabitch with a few million dollars turns to the others... with a few million dollars... and says something pretty direct like...}
<C>__{rich man 1}
<D>__{the sonofabitch is gonna get re elected by a bigger vote than ever in '64. it's gonna be worse than roosevelt. the country won't survive as we know it.}
<C>__{rich man 2}
<D>__{i agree, bob, it can't go on.}
<P>__{(he looks to man 3)}
<C>__{rich man 3}
<D>__{...and bobby in '68? something's got to be done.}
<A>__{looks pass among them. there's a pause, and then...}
<C>__{rich man 1}
<D>__{he's gotta go, lou. the election's gotta be stopped.}
<A>__{there is a breathless moment with the thought in the air.}
<C>__{rich man 1}
<D>__{i talk to a lot of people. i know i'm not the only one thinking this.}
<C>__{rich man 2}
<D>__{what's the feeling in washington, jack?}
<A>__{flashback to: the pentagon in 1962.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{...so calls are made. down to washington. all over the world. they start talking about it. a few people here, there. just conversations, nothing more...}
<A>__{we see a general meeting with another general. they talk.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{generals, admirals, cia people, and probably some people on the inside of kennedy's staff young, brilliant judases, ready to go to war in southeast asia...}
<A>__{flashback to: the white house, 1962. a general talks to one of kennedy's staff a bespectacled, bright young harvard type.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{...and maybe a vice president getting separate memos from vietnam, eager to get his backers the billions of dollars in contracts for southeast asia...}
<A>__{in a white house office, lyndon johnson meets with a cabinet member, a contractor, and two military men.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{kennedy, like caesar, is surrounded with enemies. something is underway but it has no face. yet everyone in the loop knows...}
<A>__{the camera shows washington, d.c. buildings from strange angles. the feeling is still, weird, angled, alien. the buildings are twisted.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{money is at stake. big money. a hundred billion. the kennedy brothers target voting districts for defense dollars. they give tfx fighter contracts only to the counties that are going to make a difference in '64. these people fight back. their way. one day another call is made...}
<A>__{in a pentagon office, a man in civilian clothing is on the phone, his back to the screen. this is mr. y, x's superior officer. shadows pervade the room. an unshuttered window overlooks the potomac river and the white house.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{...maybe to somebody like my superior who's been running the "mongoose" program out of florida and who has no love for kennedy.}
<C>__{voice on phone}
<D>__{bill, we're going. we need your help.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{everything's cellurized. no one has said "he must die," there's been no vote, there's nothing on paper, there's no one to blame. it's as old as the crucifixion: the mafia firing squad, one blank, no one's guilty because everyone in the power structure who knows anything has a plausible deniability. there are no compromising connections except at the most secret pointerior but what's paramount is that it must succeed. no matter how many die, how much it costs, the perpetrators must be on the winning side and never subject to prosecution for anything by anyone. that is a coup d'etat.}
<C>__{y}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{voice on phone}
<D>__{in the fall. probably in the south. we want you to come up with a plan...}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{he's done it before. other countries. lumumba in the congo, trujillo, the dominican republic, he's working on castro. no big deal. in september, kennedy announces the texas trip. at that moment, second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens, greece pros, maybe some locals, cubans, maria hire, separate teams. does it really matter who shot from what rooftop? part of the scenery. the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{any chance of one of them confessing someday?}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{...don't think so. when they start to drool, they get rid of 'em. these guys are proud of what they did. they did dealey plaza! they took out the president of the united states! that's entertainment! and they served their country doing it.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{...and your general?}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always cia. went to vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in virginia. i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{ever ask him?}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{you never ask a spook a question. no pointerior he'll never give you a straight answer. general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{his name?}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{does it matter? another technician. but an interesting thing he was there that day in dealey plaza. you know how i know?}
<P>__{(jim shakes his head)}
<D>__{that picture of yours. the hoboes... you never looked deep enough...}
<A>__{flashback to: one of the hobo pictures. next to the freight entrance of the book depository, y, in a dark suit, is nonchalantly walking past the hoboes, his back to us. the camera closes in on y.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{i knew the man 20 years. that's him. the way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring. what was he doing there? if anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but i will tell you i think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered. and in fact they were you never heard of them again.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...some story... the whole thing. it's like it never happened.}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{it never did.}
<P>__{(he smiles tartly)}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just think... just think. what happened to our country .. to the world... because of that murder... vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{i keep thinking of that day, tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried kennedy, l.b.j. was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge.}
<A>__{flashback to: the white house, 1963. johnson sits across the shadowed room with lodge and others. his texas drawl rises and falls. he signs something unseen.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{gentlemen, i want you to know i'm not going to let vietnam go the way china did. i'm personally committed. i'm not going to take one soldier out of there 'til they know we mean business in asia...}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{you just get me elected, and i will give you your damned war.}
<C>__{x }
<D>__{...and that was the day vietnam started.}
