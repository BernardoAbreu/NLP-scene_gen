<L>__{interior transporter room including transporter chamber}
<A>__{(o) an unusually defective looking transporter effect in progress, alternately flashing and glowing even the transporter sound seems wrong, as if struggling to overcome some problem. at the console, chief rand and assistant are reacting in surprised, near horror as they attempt vainly to save the situation.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{starfleet, override us! override...! yank them back!}
<A>__{suddenly, from rand's console,a violent glare a protesting sound from the circuitry. and on the con sole a red warning light now begins flashing.}
<C>__{starfleet voice}
<D>__{unable to retrieve their pattern, enterprise....!}
<A>__{rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to faintly materialize, then fade away: , then reappear in faintly misshapen form as she frantically works con trols. kirk enters fast, steps to the console to assist rand; scott has also come in and moves to the console, brushes aside the asst. chief, and begins manipulating the additional controls himself.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{we're losing the pattern...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{oh, no! they're forming!}
<A>__{closer on the transporter chamber (o) with the human forms fluttering into fuller and fuller materialization, frighteningly, horribly misshapen. we recognize one form as the vulcan, sonak the other a human woman. they materialize; we hear a moan form from the vulcan the woman's scream of pain. then, all at once, the half materialized bodies are gone; the transporter chamber is empty.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, my god...!}
<A>__{kirk, scott and rand gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(into intercom)}
<D>__{starfleet, do you have them?}
<A>__{a mutter of utter, vacant silence and kirk and scott look at each other again, their pained faces presaging the answer they already know:}
<C>__{starfleet voice}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{enterprise... what we got back didn't live long. fortunately.}
<A>__{another moment of stunned silence, and then kirk hits the transmission button fighting to control his voice as:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{starfleet... kirk. please... express my condolences to their families. commander sonak's can be reached through the vulcan embassy.}
<P>__{(see rand's stricken expression)}
<D>__{there was nothing you could have done, rand. it wasn't your fault.}
<A>__{and before rand can answer, kirk leaves the room.}
