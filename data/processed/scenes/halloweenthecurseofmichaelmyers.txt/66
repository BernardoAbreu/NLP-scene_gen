<L>__{interior helicopter (continuous)}
<A>__{loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination. wynn, wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{it's a sign. he's come home.}
<L>__{exterior pumpkin patch morning (continuous)}
<A>__{the helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth. loomis and wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades. we follow them through emergency crews and a few curiosity seekers toward the center of attention. a charred body is lifted from the eviscerated, flame blackened pikcup truck. a few feet away, a team of paramedics work frantically around another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins. loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed deputy.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{sir, you'll have to step back.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{please. i need to see the sheriff.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{official business.}
<A>__{wynn flashes his badge. the deputy gives them a vexed glance.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation. the deputy whispers something to sheriff jim holdt, a brooding giant of a man who dons a stetson, holstered .44 special and steel toed boots that give new meaning to the term "bad ass." even loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.}
<C>__{loomis}
<P>__{(extends his hand)}
<D>__{you must be sheriff holdt.}
<A>__{holdt responds by stubbing out his marlboro at loomis's foot.}
<C>__{holdt}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i am. and i take it you're the infamous dr. loomis.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{i'd like to introduce you to terence wynn, the chief of staff at }
<C>__{holdt}
<D>__{smith's grove. they told me you'd be coming. now i suggest you fly right on back to your crackpot asylum. you people got no business in my town.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{michael myers is my business.}
<A>__{holdt towers above him.}
<C>__{holdt}
<D>__{i want you to listen and listen good, loomis. things have been quiet for six years and that's the way they're gonna stay. the last thing we need is you spouting off your ghost stories.}
<A>__{as usual, loomis isn't easily intimidated.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{i suppose it was a ghost that did all this. a ghost who called the radio station last night. maybe that same ghost is lying over there right now.}
<A>__{holdt fumes, ready to boil when }
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{sheriff! she's alive!}
<A>__{holdt and loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance. a large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile gauze. skin pasty white. lips blue from shock.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{dear god ... jamie!}
