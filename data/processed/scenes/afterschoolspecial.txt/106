<L>__{interior naomi's bedroom night}
<A>__{deacon and naomi are under the covers, making out.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{so, do you have anything?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you know. protection.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{oh. oh yeah. of course.}
<A>__{she sees he's nervous.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{don't you want to?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{then what's the problem?}
<A>__{deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking. a long beat. then,}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{it's my first time.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{that's okay. just go slow.}
<A>__{and he does. he's nervous at first, not sure what to do. but as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow fade in of porno music playing in deacon's head. (now that deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies.) the music grows louder when:}
<C>__{fred }
<P>__{(in deacon's head)}
<D>__{every two minutes, they change positions.}
<A>__{he pauses, and cocks his head in confusion. he tries to shake fred's voice out of his head, but he can't.}
<D>__{fred (v.o.) (cont'd) it's a basic rule of porno.}
<A>__{finally, he gives in to the porno music. he rolls naomi on top of him.}
