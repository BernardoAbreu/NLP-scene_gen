<A>__{kenny carries jody into the huge bedroom. a couple of kids look up as the door opens. there must be over a 100 teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets. the room is just a sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets.}
<C>__{kid on floor}
<D>__{there's no room in here.}
<C>__{another kid}
<D>__{yeah. get lost we're packed.}
<A>__{kenny pays no attention to them. he shoves his way into a corner, pissing off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. he puts jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.}
