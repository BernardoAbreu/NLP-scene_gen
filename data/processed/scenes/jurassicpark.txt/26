<L>__{int control room afternoon}
<A>__{hammond enters and crosses to his throne. hammond swivels to arnold who exhales smoke. nedry looks over, keeps typing.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{wh}
<A>__{ere are they? punch 'em up.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{they'll be by the trike's in a moment. trike's sick again.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{how can you say it so matter of factly? the trike's. you casually accept it, but i never can. you know what it means when you say "by the trikes"? "by the trike's" means that they're out there by the species: triceratops horridus. it astounds me every time what i've done here. what magic, what alchemy. we turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. i will never be complacent about that.}
<A>__{arnold smiles and punches a button. we hear the pre recorded tour voice and some chatter of the kids. eavesdropping on the tour is interrupted by a radio transmission to the control room. arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring. the picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{hello, john. this is the anne b at the dock. i'm looking at the storm patterns just south of us. requesting permission to leave before unloading the last three food containers.}
<A>__{nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{don't want to be stuck here if this chop gets much worse.}
<A>__{hammond reacts with quiet dismay. nedry quietly gets up.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{coffee anyone?}
<A>__{he's ignored. arnold defers to hammond who leans to the microphone.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hello skipper, john hammond, how are you tonight? i certainly don't want to imperil anyone. but can you give us one more container of food? then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return. could you help us out here? of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{well ... we'll do our best, sir. we'll get one more container off. how's that?}
<A>__{hammond thanks him and signs off. arnold looks at the darkening clouds.}
