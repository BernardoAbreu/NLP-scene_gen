<A>__{sebastian snickers.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i don't find this very funny,}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{so that's what this is all about.}
<P>__{(imitating kathryn)}
<D>__{we'll get together and plan your curriculum.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{keep your friends close and your enemies closer. when i get through with her, she'll be the premier blow job queen of the tri state area and poor little court's heart will be shattered.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{why go through cecile? why not just attack court?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{because if there's an attack made on court it could be traced back to me. i can't allow that to happen. everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i see your pointerior.. though why should i care?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i need you to seduce our young cecile. introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sounds intriguing.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{she's quite cute you know. young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.}
<A>__{sebastian watches kathryn rub herself. he licks his lips.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{be her captain picard, valmont. boldly go where no man has gone before.}
<A>__{sebastian places his hand over kathryn's as she continues to rub herself. he thinks for a moment, then:}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{kathryn throws his hand off of hers.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh come on, kathryn. it's too easy. "but i thought high school was only four years." i mean, please. she knows nothing. she's seen nothing. i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. i have a reputation to uphold.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that was just simple revenge. what i have planned requires sheer genius.}
<A>__{he takes a magazine and throws it on the table. kathryn picks it up. it's the latest issue of "seventeen."}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i'm not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{shut up and turn to page 64.}
<A>__{she turns to the page. insert magazine article: the title reads: a virgin's manifesto. "why i plan to wait until marriage," by annette harrison. age 17. kansas city, missouri.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{jesus christ, is she for real?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh yes. i've read it over and over again. this baby's the real deal. daddy's little angel. a paradigm of chastity and virtue.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{b.f.d. what do you plan to do? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it just so happens we're not in kansas anymore. our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood. she's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house. can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? it will be my greatest victory.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{you don't stand a chance. even this is out of your league.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{care to make a wager on that?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i will think about it...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh well, duty calls. time to add another chapter to my work of art.}
<A>__{he holds up a leather bound journal.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh gee, your journal. could you be more queer?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{could you be more desperate to read it?}
<A>__{sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh sebastian. about that little wager of yours.}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{count me in.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what are the terms?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{if you lose, then that hot little porsche of yours is mine.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{and if i win?}
<A>__{she approaches him.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i will give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{be more specific.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{in english.}
<P>__{(whispers in his ear)}
<D>__{i will fuck your brains out.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what makes you think i'd go for that bet? that's a seventy thousand dollar car.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{because i'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.}
<A>__{sebastian sneers at her.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{do we have a deal?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no way, that car means everything to me.}
<A>__{she kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{you can put it anywhere.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{even there?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<P>__{(baby talk)}
<D>__{it would feel so yummy.}
<A>__{sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{happy hunting.}
