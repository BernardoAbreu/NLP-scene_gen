<A>__{luna pulls out peeling rubber, but he's nearly surrounded. squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street. another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump out and start firing. luna hits the fender of the squad car head on, knocking both officers to the ground. he spins the van around with cops firing from every angle, jumps the curb, and roars past the roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all directions.}
