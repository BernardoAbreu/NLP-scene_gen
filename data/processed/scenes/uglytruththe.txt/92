<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it wasn't just one...it was more like a parade. by the time i hit thirty, i realized you can only have so many bad relationships before you figure out there's no such thing as a good one.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you can't really believe there's no such thing as a good relationship.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm serious. i've seen your spazzy dance, now i want to see the real thing.}
