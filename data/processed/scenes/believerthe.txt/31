<A>__{danny (now wearing a plain white t shirt) bends over the coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the post. his father eats off a tv table. he finishes, cursorily wipes his mouth, picks up a remote and turns on the television.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's friday....}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(a hoarse rasp)}
<D>__{do i give a shit?}
<A>__{danny holds up both hands: he's not arguing, simply informing.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath, because it's work, correct?}
<P>__{(danny sighs)}
<D>__{but if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and i throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{"do chickens give milk?"}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{he channel surfs until he comes to a stand up comic doing a routine. they both watch. tv: the comic is funny in a brutal, compulsive way. lots of pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. the routine reflects what danny (and the shiites, the unabomber, timothy mcveigh, t.s. eliot, et al.) have against the modern world.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{dennis leary.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{leary?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the father grunts with grim satisfaction, he suspected as much.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(offering consolation)}
<D>__{howard stern.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{danny sighs: why bother. but adds...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{adam sandler.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{funny?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{not like mr. dorfmann.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{he was funny.}
<A>__{as they watch, apropos of nothing:}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{after your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. doing your homework. everything.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and that's when the mets started to stink.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{'cause they got rid of johnson. he knew how to deal with the assholes. dallas green, please...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{valentine...}
<A>__{the father snorts. on tv the comic gets off a line, and they both laugh. their laughs are quite similar; they glance at each other.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{there's some maple walnut in the freezer.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{just a little... what's the difference?}
<A>__{danny goes into the kitchen. the father extracts a pack of salems from between the cushions, lights one, takes a desperate drag... the phone rings. he curses, stubs it out, grabs the phone.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{yeah?... hold on.... it's for you.}
<A>__{danny gives his father a dish of ice cream, takes the phone.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hello...?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{daniel balint? my name's guy danielsen. i'm a reporter with the new york times.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(impressed, suspicious)}
<D>__{new york times...?}
<A>__{his father looks up. danny takes the phone into the kitchen.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i'm doing a piece on right wing groups, post oklahoma city. i hear you're an important figure in those circles. you have a lot of interesting ideas....}
