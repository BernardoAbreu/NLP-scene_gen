<L>__{exterior softball field day}
<B>__{the right man for the job}
<A>__{his name is lieutenant junior grade daniel allistair kaffee, and it's almost impossible not to like him. at the moment he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen lawyers who are spread out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. the '27 yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own against a group of, say, airforce dentists. kaffee's in his late 20's, 15 months out of harvard law school, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it. he is, at this point in his life, passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(calling out to the team)}
<D>__{alright, let's get two!}
<A>__{he smacks one to the second base. the ball bounces right between his legs.}
<C>__{second base}
<D>__{sorry!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{nothing to be sorry about, sherby. just look the ball into your glove.}
<A>__{he smacks one out to the same place. it bounces off the heel of sherby's glove and into center field.}
<C>__{second base }
<D>__{sorry!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you gotta trust me, sherby. you keep your eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten.}
<A>__{spradling, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, walks up behind the backstop.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{kaffee!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{let's try it again.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{kaffee!!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{dave. you seem upset and distraught.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{we were supposed to meet in your office 15 minutes ago to talk about the mcdermott case. you're stalling on this thing. now we got this done and i mean now, or no kidding, kaffee, i will hang your boy from a fuckin' yardarm.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{a yardarm?}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{sherby, does the navy still hang people from yardarms?}
<C>__{sherby}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{i don't think so, danny.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(back to spradling)}
<D>__{dave, sherby doesn't think the navy hangs people from yardarms anymore.}
<P>__{(back to the field)}
<D>__{let's go, let's get two!}
<A>__{he goes back to hitting fungoes.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{i'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty. plead guilty and i will recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{it was oregano, dave, it was ten dollars worth of oregano.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{yeah, well your client thought it was marijuana.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{my client's a moron, that's not against the law.}
<A>__{swapp! the third baseman takes one in the face.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ow. that had to hurt.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{way to keep your head in the play, lester. walk it off!}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{i've got people to answer to just like you, i'm gonna charge him.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{with what, possession of a condiment?}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{kaffee }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{dave, i've tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for tall time, i'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{you won't got it.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i will get it. and if the mtd is denied, i will file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that i'm gonna file against pre trial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a signalman second class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{b misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{c misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty.}
<C>__{spradling}
<D>__{i don't know why i'm agreeing to this.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{'cause you have wisdom beyond your years. dave, can you play third base?}
