MARIE CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds... She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling her BABY DAUGHTER...}
