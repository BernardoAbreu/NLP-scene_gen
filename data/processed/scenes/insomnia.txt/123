<C>__{fred}
<D>__{are you sure about that?}
<C>__{walter}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{could i have some more coffee, detective burr?}
<A>__{ellie nods, takes the cup. heads over to the coffee machine. fred turns back to the door... and at that moment walter levels a look right at will. mouths the words wild card. a shiver down will's spine. wild card. the gun. randy.}
<B>__{ellie}
<A>__{over at the coffee machine. pouring coffee. glances up at the window. catches the reflection of the two men. an intense look between them.}
