<L>__{2 7099. the women watch him tensely. he holds the receiver}
<A>__{away from his ear a little, and the buzzer is heard sounding on filter. lisa looks toward thorwald's apartment; then stella; then jeff.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{thorwald's apartment. he comes out of the bedroom toward the phone. he wears a light summer coat and tie, despite the heat. in the bedroom, everything is packed with the exception of one open suitcase. we see another suitcase, his sample case, and a couple of topcoats across the bed. he approaches the phone hesitantly, undecided whether or not to answer it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(off, half aloud)}
<D>__{go ahead, thorwald pick it up. you're curious. you wonder if it's your girl friend calling. the one you killed for. pick it up, thorwald!}
<A>__{quickly thorwald does pick it up.}
<C>__{thorwald}
<P>__{(cautiously, on filter)}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{did you get my note?}
<A>__{there is a pause as thorwald gropes for an answer. we can almost hear his breathing.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well did you get it, thorwald?}
<C>__{thorwald}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i will give you a chance to find out. meet me in the bar at the brevoort and do it right away.}

<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{now stop wasting time, thorwald, or i will hang up and call the police.}

<P>__{(breathing heavily)}
<D>__{i only have a hundred dollars or so.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's a start. i'm at the brevoort now. i will be looking for you.}
<A>__{he hangs up before thorwald can reply. thorwald looks at the receiver a moment, then he slowly hangs up. he stands at the phone thinking. he doesn't suspect he is being watched through the window. then he makes up his mind and starts for the door. after he goes out he tests the door to make certain it is locked.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(over)}
<D>__{let's go, stella.}
