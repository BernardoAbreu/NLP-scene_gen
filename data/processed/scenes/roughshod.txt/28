<T>__{insert telegram of the period:}
<A>__{sheriff gardner: aspen, nev. be advised of escape of lednov, peters and mccall convicted}
<B>__{murderers serving life terms. believed headed for california.}
<A>__{l.b. grove, warden state penitentiary norton, nev. back to scene. clay hands the telegram back.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{now are you interested?}
<A>__{clay nods.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{you should be. maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{maybe he did.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{we're going to look for him. want to come along?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.}
<C>__{gardner}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{and that's more important than finding lednov?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. if he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.}
<A>__{he turns toward the steps.}
<C>__{gardner}
<P>__{(with irony)}
<D>__{i will drop the sheriff in sonora a line to sort of look around for him.}
<A>__{clay speaks over his shoulder as he goes down.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thanks.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as clay starts away, steve follows him. clay doesn't cross to the blacksmith shop. he goes along the sidewalk toward the general store. steve hurries to catch up with him.}
