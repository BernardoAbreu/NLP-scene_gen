<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior hospital room tight on ripley gateway station}
<A>__{she's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female med tech raises the backrest. she is surrounded by arcane white medical equipment. the med tech exudes practiced cheeriness.}
<D>__{med tech why don't i open the viewport? watch your eyes.}
<A>__{harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into the ceiling, revealing a breathtaking vista. beyond the sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively called gateway station, is the curve of earth as seen from high orbit. blue and serene.}
<P>__{med tech (cont'd)}
<D>__{and how are we today?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{terrible. med tech just terrible? that's better than yesterday at least.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long have i been on gateway station? med tech just a couple of days. do you feel up to a visitor?}
<A>__{ripley shrugs, not caring. the door opens and a man enters, although ripley sees only what he is carrying. a familiar large, orange tomcat.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{jones!}
<A>__{she grabs the cat like a life preserver.}
<C>__{ripley }
<P>__{(cooing baby cat talk)}
<D>__{come here jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing.}
<A>__{jones patiently endures ripley's embarrassing display, seeming none the worse for wear. the visitor sits beside the bed and ripley finally notices him. he is thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness. a smile referred to as "winning."}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{nice room. i'm burke. carter burke. i work for the company, but other than that i'm an okay guy. glad to see you're feeling better. i'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon. side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long was i out there? they won't tell me anything.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet.}
<A>__{ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long?}
<A>__{burke gazes at her, thoughtful.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{all right. my instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...fifty seven years.}
<A>__{ripley is stunned. she seems to deflate, her expression passing through amazement and shock to realization of all she has lost. friends. family. her world.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{fifty seven...oh, christ...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you'd drifted right through the core systems. it's blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?}
<A>__{ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression becomes one of dawning horror. burke hands her a glass of water from the nightstand. she slaps it away. it shatters with a smash. jones dives, yowling. ripley grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling. the med tech hits a console button.}
<D>__{med tech}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{code blue! 415. code blue! 4 1 5!}
<A>__{burke and the med tech are holding ripley's shoulders as she goes into convulsions. a doctor and two techs run in. ripley's back arches in agony.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no...noooo!}
<A>__{they try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over equipment. her ekg races like mad. jones, under a cabinet, hisses wide eyed.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hold her...get me an airway, stat! and fifteen cc's of...jesus!}
<A>__{an explosion of blood beneath the sheet covering her chest! ripley stares at the shape rising under the sheet. tearing itself out of her. her p.o.v. as the sheet rises. a glimpse of the}
<B>__{chittering horror...it screeches.}
<A>__{tight on ripley screaming, snapping up into frame. alone in the darkened hospital room. she gasps for breath, clutching pathetically at her chest. there is no demented horror rigging itself out of her. her eyes snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of her safety. shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs. a video monitor beside the bed snaps on. a med tech's face.}
<D>__{med tech bad dreams again? do you want something to help you sleep?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(faint)}
<D>__{no.. i've slept enough.}
<A>__{the med tech shrugs and switches off. touching a button on the nightstand she opens the viewport, revealing gateway and the turquoise earth. she hugs jones to her and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the nightmare. shivering. sleep is far off.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{we made it, jones. we made it.}
<A>__{but at what price?}
