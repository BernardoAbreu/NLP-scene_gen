<A>__{jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the floor when whamm! the attic door crashes open. jessica jumps. deason looms there. sees the phone.}
<C>__{deason}
<D>__{you stupid bitch!}
<A>__{jessica hurls the phone receiver away.}
<C>__{deason }
<D>__{who have you told?! who have you told?!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no, don 't h urt m e }
<A>__{deason roars up and grabs jessica's neck with one hand. hurls her across the attic and into the old mirror, shattering it in a million pieces around her. desperate for anything, jessica palms a tiny shard as she struggles to her feet. a two inch chip.}
<C>__{deason}
<D>__{you and your kid are dead!}
<A>__{she lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath... you win.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{don't hurt me, and i will do anything... anything.. . there is a promise in what jessica offers that deason responds to. his fist flashes toward her throat, making her flinch. but rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as deason begins to enjoy his work, jessica jabs at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it snickk! she flicks her wrist up and slices the underside of his upper arm. deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny shard in her hand }
<C>__{deason}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oooh. but that's when he hears it. a dripping sound. deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve soaked in blood. it literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. deason drains white; dizzy. he looks at jessica, confused.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{brachial artery. pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. three seconds later, deason crumbles...and jessica leaves the attic.}
