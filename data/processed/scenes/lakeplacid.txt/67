<L>__{exterior campsite sunset}
<A>__{burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance. people move in silence, the wake of tragedy. a few state troopers are on the scene.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(giving a statement)}
<D>__{nobody actually saw it. it happened sudden.}
<A>__{pan to find kelly, staring almost blankly, as jack, finishing a phone call, approaches. he measures her expression, she's still in shock.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you okay?}
<P>__{(nothing)}
<D>__{kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{nobody saw anything?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{u.s. wildlife is on their way.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that's probably good.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster. they just want us to sit tight.}
<B>__{angle kelly}
<A>__{she is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off shock. jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{um... y'know...}
<P>__{(swallows)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a man died. you don't have to be so tough.}
<A>__{she nods, appreciatively. part of her would love to collapse into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm fine. i uh... i'm fine.}
<A>__{pan to find keough, walking. still visibly shaken. he unwittingly approaches hector. they hold a look.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(genuine)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{was he a good man?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{whenever somebody dies i consider it such a waste that i didn't know him better.}
<A>__{a beat. then }
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(fighting off disbelief; shock maybe)}
<D>__{his head was just... bitten off.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless.}
<A>__{keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.}
<C>__{hector }
<P>__{(quietly rattling it off)}
<D>__{i'd be on the ground looking up at my body, no head, walking around bumping into everything. and my parents wouldn't let me in the house 'cause they'd just bought all these new antique lamps and they were afraid i'd knock them over, made sense, and meanwhile, the neighborhood bullies would see my round little head on the ground looking like a ball, and they'd come rushing over to start up a game of soccer. i'd actually feel grateful just for being allowed into the contest, that's esteem for you, what are your thoughts?}
<A>__{keough has had enough of this guy.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(a powder keg)}
<D>__{you know, hector, i'm sure you're a fine person in your own mental way. but i think it would be best if you and i didn't speak.}
<A>__{and keough heads off. he takes about four steps... then snap. up goes his upside down body like a rocket. he's stepped in hector's spring bow trap. a beat. he swings upside down like a pendulum. another beat.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{this is a setback.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{you don't want to cut me down. 'cause i will kill you.}
