<L>__{int the necropolis night}
<A>__{vittoria, langdon, the camerlengo, and chartrand drop down through an open hole and into an underground city of ancient, winding streets. part museum, part ruin, they run past ancient structures, some hundreds, some thousands of years old. the rectangular tombs are similar to little houses, complete with doorways, thresholds, windows, and terraces. around a corner, the camerlengo seems to know exactly where he's going; he leads them down a narrow stone passageway. around another corner, they hurry up a small hill. at the top of the grade, there is a stone grotto, toward which the camerlengo is racing. he reaches the grotto, searches, but finds nothing. langdon and vittoria come to a stop behind him, breathing hard.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{it must be here! it must be!}
<A>__{he rips aside some protective tarps, finds that underneath the actual burial site is an underground area, part of a dig in progress. he climbs down into it, we see just the top of his head as a soft glow seems to emanate from beneath him. the camerlengo's head is wreathed in light for a moment, and then, as he climbs out, we see that he's holding in his hands the glowing canister of anti matter. on the ground nearby, vittoria drops to her knees, a tiny silver pellet in one hand, two wires leading from opposite ends of it.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{set it down flat.}
<A>__{the camerlengo does. langdon bends close. vittoria checks the timer.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{we still have seven minutes. good.}
<A>__{she leans down, reaching for the canister's baseplate. as she does, a drop of sweat rolls to the tip of her nose she freezes. wipes the sweat away, thinking about it}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{it's hot down here. isn't it?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{heat decreases battery life. we may have less than five minutes.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{if i pull the power with less than five minutes, the residual charge won't hold suspension. we should leave it and get clear if we can. at least if it goes off down here the damage will be }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{and with that, he snatches up the canister and takes off running, back the way they came.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{father, please!}
<A>__{but he's already gone, around a darkened corner.}
