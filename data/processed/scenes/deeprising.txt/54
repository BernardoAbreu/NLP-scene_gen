<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior hold night}
<A>__{a massive fist plows into pantucci's stomach. he drops from the arms of mulligan, a scar faced irishman with a buzz cut. as quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by the man who hit him, vivo, a merciless maori, covered by tattoos, topped off with venom.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{you know what my goal is? before i die i want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{you mean countries that are acknowledged by the un...or like made up countries too?}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{like mamooli's country...}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{what you talkin'? samoa's a county!}
<C>__{vivo}
<D>__{it's a dot on a map...}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{map...no map...i don't give a shit ...they got women on samoa, it's on the list.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{mr. billy you're in the batter's box.}
<A>__{hanover watches calmly as billy, the aborigine, cracks his fist against the side of pantucci's head, knocking him out of vivo's arms.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{at home we denosy the nosy.}
<A>__{billy hoists pantucci. he draws his knife under pantucci's bloody nose.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{we're not savage here mr. billy... we're professionals. hold him...mr. chin...}
<A>__{the chinese merc steps forward, and whaps pantucci upside the head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. pantucci hits the wall hard, crumbling. chin lifts him.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{anyone else?}
<A>__{massive mason steps forward.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{i will take a go and the i vote we throw the little weasel overboard...}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{i vote we slit his throat then throw him overboard...}
<A>__{mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back, taking dead aim at pantucci's face. he never gets the punch off. his arm is caught from behind. he looks over his shoulder to finnegan. gripping his wrist. right in his face.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{...this is not a democracy. you don't get a vote.}
<A>__{mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. finnegan twists his arm sharply, sending mason's head into the steel wall, knocking the big man senseless. the other mercenaries go to draw their weapons. before the guns are out of holsters, finnegan swings a spear gun into hanover's face, an inch from his eye.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{i will say it again for the hearing impaired...}
<A>__{finnegan cocks the spear. click! hanover does not blink. everyone freezes. with his free hand finnegan lifts pantucci to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. finnegan backs out of the room.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{this isn't right finnegan. i've got a contract.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<P>__{(reciting)}
<D>__{20 hours on the clock. out and back. double for overtime.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{and no questions asked.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{who asked any?}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{he did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? i need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, i'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion.}
<A>__{with that finnegan leads pantucci out of the hold, slamming the door behind him.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{thanks...}
<A>__{finnegan turns his gaze to pantucci. it makes the smaller man quiver.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{you put me in that position again i will throw you overboard myself.}
<A>__{finnegan stalks off. pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means it.}
