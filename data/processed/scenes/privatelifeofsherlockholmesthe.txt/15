<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{watson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table, finishing his coffee. in front of him is a letter, on blue note paper, and a pair of theatre tickets.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{but on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that i would gladly have murdered him had it not been for my saintly disposition.}
<A>__{watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and the tickets, rises from his chair. he starts to pace addressing holmes, who is off scene.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{why are you being so stubborn, holmes? why won't you go? it's the final performance of the imperial russian ballet the house has been sold out for months }
<A>__{he moves towards the door of holmes' bedroom day holmes is sitting in a hip bath with a high back, soaping himself. watson appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{ seats are going for a guinea apiece }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's precisely it. why should someone send up two free tickets? anonymously, at that.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{whoever sent them must be in great distress. the note says }
<P>__{(reading it)}
<D>__{'please! you are the only man in the world who can help me.'}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i suspect it's some sort of plot.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap...?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{somebody wants to kill me.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{kill you?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's right. it's a plot to bore me to death. i detest ballet.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{but this isn't just any ballet. it's swan lake.}
