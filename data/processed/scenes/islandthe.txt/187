<L>__{interior motel room evening}
<A>__{s c h e e r opens the door. merrick stands at the threshold with an attache case. scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i told you we shouldn't have gone to outside personnel. they were cowboys.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{we had no choice, karl. we had to keep this away from the institute.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{an d now?}
<A>__{merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. he opens his attache and pulls out a contract folder. he hands it to scheer.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{your resignation papers. maybe `early retirement' would be more accurate...}
<A>__{s c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{t e n platinum bounty if you sign the papers, their loss becomes your gain.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{a parachute... so there's a jump?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you understand that whatever happens, the institute must be able to deny it.}
<A>__{s c h e e r says nothing. merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out a case. inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe gun.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{we use a chemical to dispose of waste product. it's called di halcyonate. i t reacts on a molecular level to start a process of internal combustion. the subject is incinerated from the inside out. in post mortem application it's done its job before rigor mortis. in a live subject, well... you can imagine.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{you want to dispose of your products.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i t ' s a little more complicated than that. we have to be very... thorough. if you still have it in you, that is.}
<A>__{s c h e e r gives him a sideways look. then displays the usmc ring.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{why do you think i still wear this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i was discharged from the marines for insubordination. if you asked anyone i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. i disobeyed an order to fall back. i took out a bunker complex single handed.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{s o you wear it is a badge of honor?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{n o . it wasn't bravery. i wasn't afraid of dying. i just didn't care. you see, i suddenly realized i was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat. life, death, i just couldn't see the point anymore.}
<A>__{merrick allows a respectful pause, then }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you'll find a vehicle parked outside. it's unregistered, difficult to trace. i take it we have an agreement...?}
