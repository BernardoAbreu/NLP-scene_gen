<A>__{bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown he's ever seen: rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers attached to their belts. two rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless with the butts of their sawed off shotguns.}
