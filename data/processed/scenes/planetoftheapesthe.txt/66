<L>__{exterior waterfall and pool full shot day}
<A>__{the cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool. thick foliage grows to its very edge. dodge is on his hands and knees, testing the liquid with his kit. the others wait expectantly.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{it's loaded with minerals, but safe.}
<A>__{without further ado landon ducks his face into the pool. dodge scoops up water in his hands and drinks. taylor follows suit.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(coming up for air)}
<D>__{can we take a dip?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{landon and dodge immediately remove their boots, strip down and plunge into the pool. but taylor does not yet disrobe. alert and curious, he strolls along the bank of the pool, looking around.}
