<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{just kick back and relax, man. we got everything you need: cd, cb, tv, vhs, telephone, full bar.}
<A>__{he looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear.}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{if your friend is hot to trot...i know a couple of mama bears.}
<P>__{(turning to mcclane)}
<D>__{...or is he married?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{married.}
<A>__{mcclane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a rustling noise reveals wrappers and styrofoam from taco bell. he scowls at argyle.}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{the girl was off today. hey, i didn't expect you to sit up front.}
<P>__{(back to the topic)}
<D>__{so, your lady live out here?}

<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{you're nosey, you know that, argyle?}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{hey, i'm sorry. when i was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, i forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.}

<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay.}
<C>__{argyle}
<P>__{(instantly)}
<D>__{so, you divorced of what?}
<A>__{mcclane gives up.}
<C>__{mcclane}

<D>__{'cause i'm a new york cop who used to be a new york kid, and i got six months backlog of new york scumbags i'm still trying to put behind bars. i don't just get up and move.}
<C>__{argyle}
<P>__{(to the point)}
<D>__{you mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?}
<A>__{mcclane grins, he like argyle even if he is direct.}
<C>__{mcclane}

<C>__{argyle}
