<C>__{victor}
<D>__{time running out. rate of decay accelerating. must strike now... or start again from scratch.}
<A>__{he gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab before him... but now the creature lies on a full body length steel grate. steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped with glittering needles big enough to knit with. victor glances up at the da vinci. the study of man has been daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. victor dips a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing identical marks on the body before him... now he's ramming the huge wire fed needles deep into these spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good contact. the forearms, the neck, the rib cage... now he's attaching the steel chain hooks to the four corners of the steel grate... now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig into the air. it lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, wires and all...}
<B>__{high wide angle}
<A>__{...and we get our first spectacular look at frankenstein's gloriously low tech and stupendously arcane lab. the creature dangles below us from the ceiling hoist, lying full length and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and neck, armpits and groin. the copper cables trail upward, coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly above his head in a perfectly described circle not at all unlike the da vinci... and he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding in motion, camera tracking faster and faster as he rolls it along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, lightning blazing through the windows to mark his way with wild and sinister shadows... ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper sarcophagus. amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. he positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the creature down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape. faster now, moving furiously. reaching into the murk, unhooking the chains. arraying the copper wire through air tight guide holes. spinning on his heels and reaching up, grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with reflections and secrets. camera rockets down on victor as he swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place with a thud clank! working the wing nuts on the bolts, spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the sarcophagus air tight. faster now. faster. the frenzy builds and the camera goes wild, rocketing, zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear: frankenstein. turning up the heat on the burners. cooking the copper from below. double double, toil and trouble. frankenstein. gazing through the thick glass portholes checking on his creation drifting in the murk. frankenstein. whipping up the galvanic batteries, supercharging them with steam generators. watching as they send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables along the ceiling beams. building up a charge. frankenstein. gazing at his gleaming handiwork. lightning painting his features into a twisted mask. hand on the switch. ready to rev it up and throw the throttle. over it goes. wham! overdrive. the body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first jolt of electricity hits. thunk thunk thunk! blazing with energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking. frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. a long glass tube, two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam wrenched out like a polaroid plate. he reaches up and grabs holds of a pull chain, fingers going knuckle white on the wooden handle. one hard yank. a dump tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. and here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm... eel pov (in the tube) ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the creation in the murky womb fluid, lashing at the hapless gray flesh, zapping it again with high intensity voltage. the creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges. frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.}

<P>__{(muffled through the glass)}
<D>__{live, you bastard!}
<A>__{a huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing and spasming against the glass. frankenstein jerks his head back, stunned. the fingers are scratching. he turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting the whole thing down. it cycles off, whining into silence}
<B>__{inside the sarcophagus}
<A>__{...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off. frankenstein stares at the sarcophagus. realizing his creation has stopped moving. nothing now. he sags to his knees, utterly devastated at the loss of his dream. nothing. it was all for nothing...}
<B>__{inside the sarcophagus}
<A>__{...and the creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. its mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid. frankenstein is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his hands. a soft tap. he glances over his fingers. thinking he imagined it. no. there's another tap. and another. we see it in his eyes. sheer joy and stunned exultation. triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. a bare whisper:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it's alive. it's alive.}
<A>__{and then hell breaks loose: massive convulsions wrack the sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. thump thump thump! pounding from within. head ramming against the inner lid. he races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the wing nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning man within. he unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope to hoist the lid away... ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled from below with rocket booster force. the massive copper shell goes hurtling spinning cartwheeling across the lab, demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry and splintering coat rack. victor's greatcoat goes flying. silence. frankenstein is frozen. staring at the roiling surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. an eternity passes in the space of a heartbeat. the creature erupts from the vat like a vision from hell, thrashing and gagging. murky fluid cascading in all directions. the creature seizes victor by the shirtfront, trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with electricity. victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying to break the creature's grip... ...and the whole thing tips over. victor reels back, falling as the vat slams to the ground, cascading its murky contents, washing the creature limply across the floor like a body tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping electrical discharges into the air. victor scrambles back, slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking his legs away. he finds his traction and scrambles to his feet. the creature is grasping and crawling toward him. flopping and jerking. gripped by seizures and convulsions. vomiting murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the fluid. swiping the air with palsied hands. malfunctional. victor stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring down at the creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife to this ghastly birth. softly:}

<D>__{what have i done?}
<A>__{the creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching his clothes, pawing him.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{let go of me!}
<A>__{victor can't break free. panicking. he snatches a hammer from a nearby table and brings it down on the creature's head. thud! again and again. beating the thing down, pounding it into submission. the creature finally collapses, sliding down victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and jerking in its own afterbirth. silence now. a ghastly tableau: victor stands in the middle of his ruined lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a dying heap. a flash of lightning silently bathes the room, jerking wild shadows across the walls. victor steps over the creature. dazed. he drops the hammer. it clatters to the floor. he stops to jot a final entry:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{massive birth defects. result is malfunctional and vile.}
