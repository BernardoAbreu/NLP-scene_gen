<A>__{jake flies with neytiri along a forested ridge. she is teaching him to hunt from his banshee. they carry their bows at the ready, scanning below them for prey. a huge shadow covers him and neytiri shouts a warning. jake looks up to see a leonopteryx in a delta dive, whistling straight at him. like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king predator of the air: the great leonopteryx. striped scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head it is both gorgeous and terrifying. the hunter has become the prey. jake snap rolls and dives toward the forest canopy. he plummets into the gloom as k crash the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following him down, both diving like missiles and jake yanks into a hair pin bank, right through a gap between two huge branches forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud fwoosh of wings. it banks away with a frustrated shriek. two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy. close on the leonopteryx, as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling screech which echoes among the mountains. the lord of its domain. on jake, shaken. neytiri flies up, her expression the na'vi equivalent of oh my god. a beat they both crack up.}
