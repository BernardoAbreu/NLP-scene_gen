<L>__{exterior "price club" store evening}
<A>__{the brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door. across the lot, the chubby cub scouts, at their own table, see them. the scouts head towards the brownies.}
<C>__{ugly cub scout}
<D>__{hey skeever, what's in a girl scout's pants when she has diarrhea? 2nd scout brown...}
<A>__{he stops short, the brownies have moved into a formation, ready to strike, lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{go away and we won't hurt you.}
<A>__{the scouts share a look they laugh. the head scout steps forward and grabs lulu's cookies. in one move, she spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief.}
<C>__{gly cub scout}
<D>__{gimme that!}
<A>__{he grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps it around his arm, tying him. she shoves a cookie in his mouth.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{uh oh. you're gonna have to pay for that.}
<A>__{the scout struggles, the other scouts are scared.}
<C>__{ugly cub scout}
<D>__{let go! let go mommy!}
<A>__{she lets him go in a flip, he lands on the ground hard. lulu lets out another "kia!" the girls move forward in unison, striking a cool pose.}
