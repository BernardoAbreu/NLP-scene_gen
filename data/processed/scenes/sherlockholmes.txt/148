<L>__{interior house of lords}
<A>__{blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him. he calmly intones a familiar chant. lords are on their feet. guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked. members of the temple of four orders stand in front of anyone going to open them.}
<L>__{116 interior sewer tunnel day}
<A>__{holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place. shaped charge, victorian style.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we need a light, a match }
<A>__{irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle: her knife. she rolls up a sleeve.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{got it...}
<A>__{which is when a blood maddened dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving holmes and irene away from the device hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice. that's the extent of dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because bong!}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(breath crushing out of her)}
<D>__{three.}
<B>__{on the device as it goes active}
<A>__{the batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears ratchet past each other. bad news.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{dredger turns his head so that he can see watson, on his belly, crawled from the sewer where he found holmes'}
<B>__{gun.}
<A>__{bam! bam! bam! bam! four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down dredger's back (aimed so as not to hit holmes or irene on the through and through) and continue to burn inside dredger. he lurches away, eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream. bong!}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{two!}
<A>__{holmes and irene stagger for the device. fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a tree. watson is face down on the stones, still. the gun falls out of his limp hand. irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade, and... zap! a spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade, redirecting the spark toward holmes' pipe, which blows with a vicious crack! the shaped charge shears the steel rods. holmes and irene reach for the cylinders. bong!}
