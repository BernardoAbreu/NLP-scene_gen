<D>__{animal tracks. definitely too big to be spiders. could be rats.}
<A>__{mike slips past the barricades. following the tracks to the edge of the abyss. he can't see anything. it's too dark. mike turns away and returns to the yard. never realizing... several feet down the shaft. hidden under a rock... the shriveled and desiccated corpse of joshua taft. it hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing. grisly. suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper into the shaft by some unseen creature.}
