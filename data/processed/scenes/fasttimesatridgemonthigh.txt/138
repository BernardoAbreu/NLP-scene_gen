<A>__{brad slowly moves to the donut case, like a zombie.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i'm instructed to tell you that we are on a video alarm system and there are other hidden cameras in the store ...}

<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{no towels, mon...}
<A>__{the robber turns to look at spicoli, and that is all that brad hamilton needs. just like it is the most natural thing in the world, brad reaches for the hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and throws it into the gunman's face and hands.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!}
<A>__{the .45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the floor. the gunman is still grabbing his face, and looking at his skinless hands in horror when brad snaps up the gun. in the parking lot, the gunman's accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow firebird, spots the foul up and screeches out of the parking lot.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{there goes your ride home.}
<A>__{brad pulls the under counter alarm with newfound confidence. jeff spicoli stands there, mesmerized at the entire event.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{awesome. totally awesome.}
