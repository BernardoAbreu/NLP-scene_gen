<L>__{ext nevsky on deck night}
<A>__{a howling wind has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries with sleet. camera tracks past, moving steadily toward the dimly glowing window of walton's cabin...}
<L>__{int walton's cabin night}
<A>__{...where we find walton and grigori in tense discussion:}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{captain, i implore you. the men are frightened and angry. they want your assurance.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{they knew the risks when they signed on. i've come too far to turn back now.}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.}
<A>__{walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on the table before him.}
<C>__{walton}
<P>__{(low, tight)}
<D>__{let them try.}
<A>__{grigori is taken aback. he hears a shifting of blankets and glances to the captain's bed. walton follows his look. frankenstein has awakened and is watching them. grigori exits, uneasy under frankenstein's gaze. walton rises, retrieves a pot from the stove.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you're awake. i've prepared some broth. it'll help restore you.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(hoarse, faltering)}
<D>__{i'm... dying.}
<A>__{victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before his face. fingers skeletal and black.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{frostbite. gangrene. a simple diagnosis.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{are you a physician?}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{how is it you come to be here?}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{there's a startling question, coming from you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm captain of this ship. we sailed from archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the north pole.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{ah. an explorer.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{would be. i'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{i can't say i blame them. we're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{creature? a... human like creature?}
<C>__{walton}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you know of it?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{your men are right to be afraid.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{then explain it, whatever it is. it could save the voyage. i've spent years planning this. my entire fortune.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you'd persist at the cost of your own life? the lives of your crew?}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{lives are ephemeral. the knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.}
<A>__{victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls him closer. impassioned, intense:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{do you share my madness?}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{madness?}
<A>__{camera pushes slowly on victor's face...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{we are kindred, you and i. men of ambition. let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits. i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.}
<C>__{walton}
<P>__{(angry, frightened)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my name is frankenstein...}
<A>__{and camera proceeds into the bottomless depths of victor's staring eye, plunging us into: total darkness. tick tock. tick tock. a metronome fades up before us.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{failure has no pride, victor. you must try again.}
<C>__{little boy }
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
