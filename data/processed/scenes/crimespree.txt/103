<D>__{why not just steal another one?}

<C>__{julien}
<D>__{maybe i'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? any place has to be safer for us than chicago.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{it doesn't matter where we go. between zammito and the fbi they'll find us. we have to end this here.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{and how do we do that?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{i don't know.}
