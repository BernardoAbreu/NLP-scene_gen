<A>__{cor... look at that, would ya.}
<C>__{lee}
<A>__{they're a bloody sight warmer than we are.}
<C>__{fleet}
<A>__{well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, i'd rather not, if it's all the same. they both have a good laugh at that one. it is fleet whose expression falls first. glancing forward again, he does a double take. the color drains out of his face. fleet's pov: a massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out.}

<A>__{bugger me!! fleet reaches past lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs the telephone, calling the bridge. he waits precious seconds for it to be picket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead.}
<C>__{fleet}
<A>__{pick up, ya bastard.}
