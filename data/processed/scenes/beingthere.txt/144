<L>__{interior rand's hospital room morning}
<A>__{allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong rand's life, sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. teresa shows chance into the room and allenby motions to the nurses to leave. as they do, chance, once again breathing the oxygen with a smile, goes to rand's bedside.}
<C>__{rand}

<A>__{rand slumps down, dead. allenby checks his pulse, turns to chance.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{... he's gone, chauncey.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, robert. i have seen it before. it happens to old people.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(covers rand's face)}
<D>__{yes, i suppose that's true.}
<A>__{chance reaches out, uncovers rand's face, gently touches the man's forehead, feels the coldness. allenby eyes him as chance stays with rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(turns to allenby)}
<D>__{will you be leaving now, robert?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{in a day or two, yes.}
<C>__{chance}

<P>__{(a smile at allenby)}
