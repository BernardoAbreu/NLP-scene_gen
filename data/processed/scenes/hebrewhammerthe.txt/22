<L>__{interior mrs. carver's dining room 4 hours later}
<A>__{the hammer and esther grasp their stomachs which protrude from underneath their slightly unbuttoned shirts. plates of half eaten food are everywhere. on the table, on the dining room furniture behind them, etc.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oy vey, i'm stuffed.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{i don't think i could eat another latke if you paid me.}
<A>__{mrs. carver enters the dining room through the kitchen door carrying an enormous platter loaded with serving dish after serving dish of food.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{everybody ready for the main course?}
<A>__{esther and the hammer exchange looks.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom, i think we've had enough.}
<A>__{mrs. carver places the food on a dresser opposite the kitchen table and then sits.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<P>__{(hysterically)}
<D>__{nonsense young man. you'll eat everything in front of you. after all, there are people starving in china. isn't that right mun chi?}
<A>__{we cut to a previously unseen end of the table. mun chi, a skin and bones elderly chinese man looks up in response to his name. the plate directly in front of him is still pristine. he mutters something in chinese and then reaches for a chicken wing on a platter in the middle of the table. mrs. carver smacks his hands away with a wooden salad spoon and then glares at him.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{not until mordechai finishes everything in front of him.}
<A>__{mrs. carver directs her piercing stare at the hammer.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{mordechai!?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, esther, how did you and mordechai meet. you know they call him the hebrew hammer for a reason.}
<A>__{esther coughs up some of her food. the hammer interjects.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom! esther works for the jdl. they sent her to try and recruit me back to save hanukkah for them. what she doesn't seem to understand is that nothing, not even god himself could convince me to ever work for them again.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{but hanukkah's in dan...}
<A>__{the hammer cuts her off.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{not my problem. if you'll excuse me now, i need to use the bathroom.}
<A>__{he stands and leaves. mrs. carver stares lovingly at esther.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{you like my mordechai, yes?}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{he's...he's very nice.}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{but mrs. carver, the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands. please, you have to help me.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{hanukkah, shmanukkah. it isn't even one of the high holidays. what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will make you a deal. i will help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai.}
<C>__{esther}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{he works too much. god forbid he should have a nice jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. take his mind off his work. maybe a blowjob here and there.}
<A>__{esther begins to choke again.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{is this something you could do for me?}
<A>__{the hammer calls out from the bathroom.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom, where do you keep the plunger?}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{it's under the sink by my tampons!}
<A>__{esther appears panicked.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{so, do we have a deal?}
<A>__{in the bg, we hear the toilet flush. the hammer begins his walk back to the table.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{the hammer sits down.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{so, what did you two ladies discuss while i was gone.}
<A>__{esther begins to speak, but mrs. carver interrupts.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{i was just telling your nice friend esther about how i used to have such a problem with the gas.}
<P>__{(to esther)}
<D>__{so, once i started taking two charcoal pills before i ate, the gas cleared itself right up.}
<A>__{esther plays along.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{thanks. that's...good to know.}
<A>__{mrs. carver turns her attention towards her son.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{mordechai. do you love your mother?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom, stop with this already. of course i love you. you're my mother.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{then how come you won't stop this certified circumcised dick nonsense and get yourself a real job.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom, i have a real job. i do good things for this community. i help people.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{when i play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. they show pictures. their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis. why can't i show a picture?}
<C>__{hammer}
<P>__{(angered)}
<D>__{so don't show a picture.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{you know my friend maureen? her son, the investment banker? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton. what a mench he is. instead of schleping to save hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba. maybe then you could send me to boca, too.}
<A>__{this puts the hammer into a neurotic fit.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oh. oh, what. so, all of a sudden my saving hanukkah's not good enough for you? is that what your saying?}
<A>__{mrs. carver throws her arms up in resignation.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{i don't want to argue with you. let's just eat in peace.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{no. no. we're gonna argue. and you know what mom? i'm going to save hanukkah just to spite you. and when my face is all over the television. when your friends are opening their hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? i wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<D>__{do what you must.}
<A>__{mrs. carver looks at esther and winks.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<P>__{(to esther)}
<D>__{such a good boy he is.}
<A>__{the hammer shakes his head in frustration. mrs. carver becomes very animated.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{mazel tov!}
<A>__{mazel tov, a tabby with two paralyzed back legs wearing a diaper slides itself across the floor. with each writhing motion we hear a very distinct swishing noise. mrs. carver picks the cat up and places it in her lap. mazel tov makes a strange, unhappy noise.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{what's that mazel tov? your diaper needs changing?}
<A>__{mrs. carver pulls off mazel tov's diaper while it still sits in her lap. she plays with undiapered cat's two good paws.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<P>__{(to mazel tov)}
<D>__{let's let your tuchus breathe.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?}
<C>__{mrs. carver}
<P>__{(extremely offended)}
<D>__{because it isn't god's way. when you spent the fourth grade in bed recovering from your bout with hypoglycemia, did i put you down? no. mazel tov will lead a full life just like the rest of us. isn't that right mazel tov?}
<A>__{the cat purrs back at her. she takes the cat from her lap and places it on the floor. brown streaks cover her white blouse.}
<C>__{mrs. carver }
<D>__{anybody hungry for desert?}
