<P>__{(very difficult to say)}
<D>__{there's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. i wonder if it's fair to put them through this.}
<A>__{andrew's father stares at his folded hands.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{all i know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. but when they fired you... you were so devastated, andy... i don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. fight for your rights.}

<D>__{thanks, mom... dad?}
<A>__{there's a pause before bud beckett speaks.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{supposedly, the lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle. but i'm having a hard time believing that these days.}
<A>__{andrew's construction worker brother, randy, wipes tears from his eyes. clearly their father is in alot of pain.}
