<L>__{interior pyramid chamber of the gods}
<A>__{a long corridor stretching off into the darkness. they keep moving. lex's flashlight illuminates a gigantic statue. then another. the corridor is lined with them. each statue is a predator warrior carved out of stone. miller and sebastian stare up at one of these bizarre stone creatures. they're humanoid in shape, though much larger than a human being in size. their heads are larger and they're wearing massive helmets. they're fierce, frightening and very powerful looking hunter beasts.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{dear god.}
<A>__{many of the statues also show the predators engaged in combat with another species... aliens. the statues portray the predators battling the aliens as if they were george fighting the dragon. max is staring at another elaborate drawing showing the predators carrying their distinctive plasma guns the ones they're carrying. lex walks up behind him.}
<B>__{lex}
<D>__{recognize what's on their shoulders?}
<A>__{sebastian examines the walls of the chamber. ancient painted murals depict humans kneeling in supplication before the predators.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{we worshipped these things?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{according to this we did. and the artefacts you removed from the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.}
<A>__{predator vision: from an obscure high angle, looking down on the group of humans. the predator zooms in, focusing on the backpacks carried by max, verheiden and bass. within the packs are the three predator plasma guns. the plasma guns fill the frame.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the heat bloom that your satellite detected makes more sense now.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a building this sophisticated would require a major energy source. that's what the satellite detected, the power plant for this pyramid firing up... preparing.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{preparing for what?}
<A>__{lex consults her digital compass.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{let's get moving. just another 200 yards to the entrance.}
<A>__{close on a predator statue as the face of the statue softly distorts. it's not a statue. it's a real predator. the human team have walked straight into an ambush! stone is bringing up the rear, mp 5 in hand. a noose suddenly drops around his neck, pulls tight, and drags him into the air. stone dies silently. close on bass as a predator spear impales him. the force hurling him back with astonishing force, pinning him to the stone wall.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{get down!}
<C>__{connors}
<D>__{what the hell was that?!}
<A>__{close on a predator throwing disc: spinning through the air, its razor sharp edges catching the light.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{down!}
<A>__{lex pushes sebastian to one side as the predator disc hurtles past. it strikes a predator statue behind them, cutting through the stone like it were paper. the head of the statue comes crashing to the ground. neatly decapitated. the fate that sebastian narrowly avoided. max carries an mp 5 in both hands, firing at an optical blur running across the chamber. verheiden is also firing, filling the chamber with the deafening sound of gunfire.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{the pyramid! it's shifting again.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{the doors are closing!}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{let's get out of here!}
<A>__{the pyramid has started to reconfigure once more. thick stone slabs slide out from the wall, sub dividing the chamber and splitting the human team into three separate groups. each trapped in their own newly created stone cell: max, weyland, sebastian and lex. verheiden and miller. and connors, all by himself.}
