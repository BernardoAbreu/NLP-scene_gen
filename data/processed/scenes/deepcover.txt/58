<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{hull sits in the trans am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a dealer leans in the window telling his sob story. there's an authority to hull's manner that tells us he may not like this job, but he knows how to do it.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{...the guy ripped me off, man, so i don't got the money, i don't got the stuff and }
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(eyes on street)}
<D>__{you gotta pay anyway.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{oh, but, man...}
<A>__{as he raps on, comical pathos, hull spots in his side mirror...}
<B>__{the red range rover}
<A>__{coming slowly this way. ivy in the passenger window, the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{hull glances up: bijoux is selling on the next corner. the range rover passes the trans am. ivy leans out. hull flings open the trans am door, throwing the dealer to the ground. he jumps from the car:}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bijoux!!}
<A>__{she turns. sees ivy. she puts out her hands to block the shots. the sound of the gun is inaudible. the barrel bounces slightly. bijoux sprawls backward. bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from many wounds. hull, standing over her, covers her face.}
