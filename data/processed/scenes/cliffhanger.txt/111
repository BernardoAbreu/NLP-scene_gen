<L>__{exterior mountain sloping grade gabe and kristel}
<A>__{gabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain edge, ahead of kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{how much further?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{it's right over there.}
<A>__{gabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a}
<B>__{a shed}
<A>__{that is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant across a snowy plateau.}
<B>__{gabe and kristel}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{it's a storage locker for the rangers. everything you need to get off the mountain is in there skiis, food i will show you }
<A>__{gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly moving ahead again kristel suspiciously notices this }
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{kristel gets ahead of gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun trained on him as she crunches through the snow.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{skiis, food and maybe guns too, right?}
<P>__{(moves backward)}
<D>__{keep walking. not too close.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{we'd make better time walking straight ahead. qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer.}
<C>__{kristel}
<P>__{(walking backward)}
<D>__{right. so i'd better have one less problem when he arrives.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(knowing this means him)}
<D>__{don't fuck up. you still need me to show you a route off the mountain.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{you've worn that one out, walker }
<P>__{(snaps back bolt)}
<D>__{ i will find my own way down.}
<A>__{kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot gabe, but her feet sink through the crystallized snow cover kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it collapses under her she's pulling the trigger and shots go wild as she sinks and sinks }
<B>__{on gabe}
<A>__{who's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same fate as he scrambles back to solid land, kristel's shots arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles around him but he bellies ahead as on the snowdrift's top kristel's gunshots slow, and finally, stop, the very last of them loosening the snow around the "shed" that was obscured by snow was a tall, three sided park service sign shouting "warning snowdrift do not cross" in eight different languages. the rest of the snow falls away from it, revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration a stick figure fatally sinking into the snow.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{bellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the ice axe's staff only when he hits something solid with it does he get back up to his feet. but the sound of ice crusted snow crunching above gabe alerts him that }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him qualen's gun blazes down }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{is on the run, but it's that lead footed, slow motion stuff that only happens in nightmares with every step, a foot breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of snow gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into}
<B>__{a thick wooded area}
<A>__{which is very temporary refuge qualen will be down in seconds. gabe looks down the slope. running is impractical. so he sits down.}
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{arrives where gabe was and looks down the slope qualen's pov gabe is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder. alpinists call this a "sitting glissade". colorado climbers call it "butt skiing". some psychos do this for fun. gabe's pov the slide is anything but fun gabe can't control his speed or direction well at all gabe barely manages to steer in and out of trees and boulders in his path }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{starts running down the slope he doesn't have speed, but he does have the machine gun he fires short bursts at }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{who tries to steer away from the line of fire gabe is hit in the shoulder he slides out of control, and rolls down to the slope's bottom. gabe painfully lifts himself up and moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to}
<B>__{the lake}
<A>__{the bridge that spans it is ahead of gabe but there is nothing around but flat terrain. it's a beautiful sight, but no good for hiding. and qualen is right behind him.}
