<A>__{evey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear stained, staring at the lifeless body of v.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i remember... i remember staring at the mask, at that smile.}
<A>__{she touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{part of me couldn't believe he was dead and maybe that was why. the smile was still the same. it made me want to tear it off so i could see the face, so i could see that he was dead.}
<A>__{her fingers stop.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{but i had promised.}
<C>__{v }
<D>__{you will discover the face under this mask but you will never look beneath it.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i began to try to imagine his face. of course, i had long pictured my father behind that smile but i knew in my heart that v was not my father.}
<A>__{evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{yet every time i pictured another face, any face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished. v was more than a face. v was v.}
<A>__{her expression changes.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{and then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, i realized whose face must be beneath that mask. it was the only face that mattered.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i won't let you die.}
<C>__{v }
<D>__{i know you won't... i know.}
<A>__{a small smile creeps across her face.}
