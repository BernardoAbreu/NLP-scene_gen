<L>__{interior palace hallway night}
<A>__{lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows out candles as she goes. she finally arrives at her own chamber and enters...}
<L>__{interior palace lucilla's chambers night}
<A>__{senators gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus are waiting.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he's asleep. be quick.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{we've taking a sounding, the senate is with us.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{but we are only words. we are air. we need steel.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{the city guard is faithful to the republic. but we don't stand a chance against the praetorians.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{can they be bought?}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{they are zealots totally committed to your brother.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{well, can they at least be rented for a day?}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{i doubt it. he pays them exorbitant salaries and lets them loot and extort as they see fit. the city belongs to them.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{and they've started arresting scholars now. anyone who dares speak out even satirists and chroniclers.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{and mathematicians and christians. all to fill the arena.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{and what pays for it? these games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{the future. the future pays for it...}
<A>__{a beat. she looks at them.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he's started selling the grain reserves.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{that can't be true...}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he's selling rome's reserves of grain. the people will be starving in two years. i hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{rome must know this.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{and who will tell them?! you, marcellus? you, senator gaius? will you make a speech on the senate floor denouncing my brother? and then see your family in the colosseum? what town crier would dare?}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he must die.}
<A>__{a beat as her words sink in.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{the praetorians would only seize control themselves.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{no cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{lucilla, gaius is right. until the city guard can neutralize the praetorians we can accomplish nothing.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{and i haven't enough men.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{what about the army?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{no roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{so we do nothing?!}
<A>__{a door opens, a voice...}
<C>__{lucius' voice}
<D>__{mother...}
<A>__{an eight year old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy. he is lucius, lucilla's son.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{i heard voices...}
<C>__{lucilla}
<P>__{(going to him)}
<D>__{it's all right, darling, you }
<A>__{lucius suddenly notices senator gracchus:}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(running to gracchus)}
<D>__{senator! what did you bring me?!}
<A>__{he leaps onto gracchus gracchus laughs and pulls something from his robe.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{for you prince lucius... a sea monster!}
<A>__{gracchus gives lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea serpent.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{off the coast of achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty praetorians they come across... now, where is achaea?}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{below macedonia!}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{show me on the map.}
<A>__{lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at achaea. we sense this is an old game between them.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{lucius, you go in now, i will be in shortly.}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(to gracchus)}
<D>__{thank you, senator mountain!}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{you're welcome, prince anthill!}
<A>__{lucius goes. lucilla shuts the door after him. a moment. she turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<A>__{gracchus goes to her, holds her.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{peace child... one dark night the gods will light our path. they will give us the voice we need. have faith in that. have faith.}
