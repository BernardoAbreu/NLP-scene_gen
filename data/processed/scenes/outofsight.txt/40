<L>__{interior car same}
<A>__{as karen watches glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door. he half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs his hand through his hair...}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{...if he thinks he can talk to me like this. shit, i don't even know what i need them for.}
<A>__{karen leans forward to have a look, sees foley and buddy against the dark foliage.}
<C>__{glenn }
<D>__{i got a big score lined up up north. they wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me. i could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in january }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{glenn?}
<A>__{his head turns so that we can see his designer shades.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you don't remember me, do you?}
<C>__{glenn}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it couldn't have been out at glades, if that's what you're thinking. i was never out there.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, that's not what i'm thinking.}
<A>__{he raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{but you're sure we've met, huh?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{last fall, i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice. you're glenn michaels.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i never forget anyone i've cuffed and shackled.}
<A>__{he doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's been turned to stone.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{let's think for a minute, glenn, see if we can work this out...}
<A>__{he turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{do we have a gun in the car?}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{i remember you now. shit.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{foley's not going to make it. and if he goes down, glenn, you go with him.}
<A>__{she touches his shoulder and he jumps.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{look, i can understand if you and foley are close.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{we're not. i'm helping him, yeah }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{wait. have you helped him, glenn? at this point, technically, i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. so you still have a choice. you can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to god you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard on. or, if you want to play it another way...}
<A>__{she pauses. he turns and looks at her.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{like how?}
