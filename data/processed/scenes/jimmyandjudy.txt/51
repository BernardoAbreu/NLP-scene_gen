<D>__{that i will never ask, request, or even insinuate to jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{and furthermore, i do hereby solemnly swear to commit myself to giving jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that he has become accustomed to.}
<A>__{judy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement. her laughter and happiness is infectious. she pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again. we can hear jimmy laughing off camera as well.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{keep your right hand up.}
<A>__{judy lifts her right hand back up. she looks at the camera with a huge smile.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i do hereby solemnly swear to g...}
<A>__{thwack! someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of jimmy's car. he pans and zooms the camera over and sees a car full of three teenagers laughing at them.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{mother fuckers.}
<A>__{suddenly the teenage driver of the car appears, as if out of nowhere, running to the passenger side. jimmy zooms out. the frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge loogie into the car, hitting judy right in the face. judy screams. the car full of three teenagers laugh hysterically at her expense. jimmy hands judy the camera.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{here, you're definitely going to want to tape this.}
<A>__{jimmy calmly gets out of his car as judy tapes him through the window. we can hear her breathing heavily as she tries not to cry softly off camera. jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. we hear the trunk open while judy films through the windshield at the car full of laughing teens. jimmy enters the frame carrying a baseball bat. we see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the kid who spat in judy's face. then... wham! jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with the bat. the kid falls over into the front seat of the car. jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins bashing in the windshield.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{now rage has taken over jimmy over entirely. he's bashing in the windshield with all of his might. the teenagers all go running from the car. a crowd starts to form in the parking lot.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{oh, god jimmy...}
<A>__{jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves to the front of the car. he now begins smashing the other windows. now a sizeable crowd is formed. jimmy is seemingly oblivious to them and continues bashing the car.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i love you jimmy.}
<A>__{now it's to the point of overkill. but jimmy won't stop. it's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his entire life is now coming to the surface. we hear sirens in the distance as jimmy continues to bash the car. the car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in the distance. judy begins screaming.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy stop, please stop. jimmy... oh god, jimmy stop. god damn it, fucking stop!}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't. he pounds the car harder as a police cruiser pulls up. two policemen get out of the car. they are temporarily paralyzed with indecision. we see one of the officers trying to speak with jimmy. he just ignores them. the policemen are oblivious to the fact they are being filmed. one of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in jimmy's face. now jimmy is completely freaking out. we hear him scream, but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. one of the cops draws his gun as jimmy swings aimlessly towards them. he gets sprayed again with the mace and is now completely blinded. a huge crowd has now amassed outside of the grocery store.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh, god jimmy, oh god...}
<A>__{now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. lights are flashing all around jimmy. he is surrounded but sill continues to swing the bat.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy...}
<A>__{three cops tackle jimmy from behind. judy throws down the camera and runs out the door. the camera is face down on the seat. we hear judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. the sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming. we hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are pulling up. more screaming and sounds on the radio is heard. we hear police chatter:}
<C>__{police chatter }
<P>__{(over the police radios)}
<D>__{we're going to need an ambulance stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on route 18...}
<A>__{more screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the car. we don't know who it is. they turn off the camera.}
