<A>__{of a slide mounted blood smear stained with wright stain (blue ink). what we see is a collection of donut shaped pink things (red blood cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the occasional larger, light blue blobs (white blood cells). karen jansen (20s), a fine featured hematologist with a social life in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. next to her is julie whitaker, a cheerful chemtech.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you took this off a doa?}
<A>__{curtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this isn't human blood.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know }
<P>__{(re: microscope)}
<D>__{look at this blood smear }
<A>__{curtis takes a look for himself.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. they're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{look at the pmns, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{what about the chemistry panel?}
<A>__{karen looks to julie, who reaches for a computer print out.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{blood sugar level is three times the norm, phosphorous and uric acid are off the scales.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{like the woman said, impossible.}
<A>__{karen removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{curtis, it's three in the morning. i'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{it's not a joke. i've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now look, just come up and see him, okay? five minutes, that's all i ask.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i thought you promised to give me some distance?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{this is purely professional curiosity, karen, i swear.}
<A>__{karen rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{five minutes, not a second more. and i don't want to hear a word about "us".}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{no problem.}
