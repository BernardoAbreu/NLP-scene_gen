<L>__{exterior new york fish market below jfk highway day}
<A>__{even in the rain doesn't keep people away. buyers haggle with sellers. a large market, truck loads of fish. no one seems to notice the river across from them...}
<B>__{mouth of the east river}
<A>__{enormous turbulence in the water. slowly something begins to lift, sheets of water fall. bursting out, the backside talons of the enormous reptile pierce through. the tail slices through the turbulence. two ships anchored at dock begin to lift upwards as the beast below them begins to rise.}
<B>__{angle fish market}
<A>__{a groaning wail roars, echoing. the people of the fish market turn just in time to see...}
<B>__{the anchored ships}
<A>__{lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. suddenly a tidal wave of water comes crashing down, flooding the fish market.}
