<L>__{exterior william wall high school parking lot day}
<A>__{fred and matt are walking towards their bikes after school.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{did you videotape it?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{yeah. i took my camera to gym class with me.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you are the biggest moron i have ever known.}
<A>__{just then, deacon comes up to them.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hey, guys. here's the money.}
<A>__{he hands out the proceeds from the operation, and matt notices that deacon is a little out of sorts.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<A>__{deacon lets out a deep breath.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah. i heard rachael unger did it with john baldwin.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, you had your chance. i told you to seal that deal.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{shut up, fabio. i don't see you sealing any deals.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i'm biding my time.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{whatever. it just wasn't good timing.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{it doesn't get any better than that. you and rachael were perfect for each other. and naked girls don't just appear out of thin air.}
<P>__{(scoffs)}
<D>__{"i have a math test tomorrow."}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{will you shut up already?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, i've been thinking about this all day. we're juniors now. upperclassmen.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{they reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{so we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. this year is our year.}
<P>__{(takes the chain off his bike)}
<D>__{there's nothing holding us back any more.}
<A>__{over in the parking lot, jake, a studly senior, revs the engine on his truck. two hot girls, kelly and wendy, sit on his bumper, chatting.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{you see? that's exactly what i'm talking about. that could be us.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{why not? all we have to do is follow the simple lessons of tony montana in "scar face."}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ooh. good movie.}
<C>__{deacon and matt}
<P>__{(with cuban accents)}
<D>__{"first you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so, we're going to become cuban drug lords?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. when i get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls.}
<A>__{fred and matt look at deacon warily. is this a plan? then, the hot girls and jake drive past the guys.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{bye, sphincter!}
<A>__{they laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{nothing's going to change, deacon. you're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i had a stomach virus, asshole.}
<A>__{just then, a super hot cheerleader drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh, that's just not fair.}
<A>__{fred adjusts himself.}
