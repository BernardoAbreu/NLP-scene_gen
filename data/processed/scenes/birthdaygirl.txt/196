<A>__{john walks without looking back. he turns to see nadia is behind him. as they round the corner, she hands him a case. they walk side by side without speaking. both look forward, straight faced, as it both are thinking about what it is that they are actually doing. john looks back once, but he keeps walking. he looks across at nadia, but she doesn't look back. they stop opposite the automatic boarding doors. nadia turns to john.}
