<A>__{and now they both try and stand. neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it quickly, but richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her. christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her fingers scratching deeply but he will not let go. she twists and jerks her body no good he continues to tighten his grip on her throat and spreads his legs for better balance. the bed table, as christy, beyond desperation reaches around for something, anything her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she slashes his right arm. now he lets go. and stares, stunned, at his bleeding arm. then he crunches her flush in the mouth, a brutal blow, and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she weren't so scared, maybe it would have stopped her, but it doesn't because somehow she manages to maintain balance and knees him all she has, in the nuts. it's over richmond falls to the floor, helpless. he lies on his back, holding his crotch. but it isn't over. christy, blood pouring down her face, stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her hand. and in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage and she drops to her knees beside him and richmond can only lie there, watching her and she gets a better grip on the letter opener and richmond still only lies there, watching her and she raises the letter opener slowly very high above her head, the point aimed at his heart and richmond screams one time and as christy starts to kill him, two well dressed men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway, guns in their hands, and they blow her brains out before the opener reaches richmond's heart...}
