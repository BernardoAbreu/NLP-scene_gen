<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior barracks night}
<A>__{it's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing cards, listening to music, whatever. jaeger lays on a bunk holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying to find a way to make it open. wes crosses over.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you get it yet?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{naw, nothing.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you will. you'll get it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i will show epps. he'll be sorry when i get this thing open.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you really think there's a treasure inside?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. i just want to be able to rub epps' face in it when i crack this thing.}
<A>__{wes watches jaeger work the box for a beat.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{jaeger?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. so?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{that's in two days.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{like i said; so?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{they're cancelling all leaves, all passes. no more drills. we stand at full ready starting }
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what's your point, wes? you have a point?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we're going to war, aren't we. if they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it doesn't mean anything.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{why would they do all that if we weren't?}
<A>__{jaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{okay, so we're going to war. we're supposed to go to war. we're soldiers, that's what we do. the guns, the tanks, the planes; you're just now getting the hint we're in the war business?}
<A>__{jaeger goes back to his box. wes stands over him for a beat longer, then:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{jaeger?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<P>__{(for sure aggravated)}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you ever think about dying?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{come on, man. i almost had this thing open.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you ever think about it? you ever worry?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass i'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. the only people who i've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them; an m 16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. now if you'll excuse me, soldier, i'd like to get back to my box. i've got a treasure to find.}
<A>__{wes lingers over jaeger for a few more beats, then walks off as we:}
