<A>__{whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large, two story, open ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm equipment and old furniture. he finds... a wall of photos whip with his father next to a plane. his grandfather, father and whip pose next to the barn. a crop duster acts as the background for a picture with a 15 year old whip and his father next to a small plane. a series of pictures feature the plane in flight and shots taken from the plane, aerials of the farm, etc. whip holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back to the plane, resting his arm on the wing. whip pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff. we recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce. we see bikes, weights and fishing gear. whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office. trophies, sports memorabilia, citations a photo of he and his wife from happier times. their wedding photo. now whip comes upon a framed black and white photo of he and charlie in their younger, navy days wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an f 14 tomcat. big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger. whip puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. he roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket. next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag. he goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf.}
