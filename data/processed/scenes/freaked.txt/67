<L>__{interior elijah's den}
<A>__{it's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of magazines like "better homes and gardens," "national review" and "freaks illustrated". elijah sits in a big barcalounger, smoking a pipe. rick sits on the sofa. toad walks up with a tray of soft drinks.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(to rick)}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{elijah points to a bowl of fiddle faddle. toad sits beside rick.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{fiddle faddle?}
<P>__{(rick shakes his head)}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, okay.}
<P>__{(he scoops some into his mouth)}
<D>__{well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{torture my greatest creation ever!? kill the final piece of the puzzle that i've been putting together for years!? sure, it'd be fun, but i've got a bigger plan, my boy.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{and when you ripped off that guy's head, i knew it was working like gangbusters!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{but i thought i scared everyone away.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{uh huh. and then they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on. look at this.}
<A>__{elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on the table. elijah opens one and reads it.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{dear mister skuggs, i was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head popping beast at your show. please send me six tickets.}
<P>__{(he reads another)}
<D>__{dear beast boy, i used to like new kids on the block, but you're way cuter. my favorite ice cream is chocolate. is it fun ripping people's heads off? i love you.}
<P>__{(another letter)}
<D>__{the beast boy is on a blood letting spree, and oscar is along for the ride!}
<P>__{(he looks up at rick)}
<D>__{that one's from pat collins!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yeah, but she loves everything.}
<A>__{rick reaches for the fiddle faddle but the bowl is empty. toad burps.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{toad! that fiddle faddle is for guests only! you've had enough!}
<A>__{toad is blankfaced. elijah walks over and refills the bowl. rick scoops some into his mouth. elijah walks to the fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look skuggs elijah i've been in show business all my life. the public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{oh, and i suppose jake and the fatman is just a fluke?}
<A>__{the phone rings. elijah looks at it, and back to rick.}
<C>__{elijah }
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{he goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{`yello?}
<A>__{on the other end of the line, we hear laughing man's insane chuckle. elijah's smooth smile fades. he turns his back to rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice. elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{yes... right... tomorrow... mmhmm... mnunhmm... wow. okay. you got it... hasta la vista to you too. hahaahahaahaha }
<A>__{laughing man hangs up on elijah. he looks a little pissed off as he turns to face rick again. grumbling, he takes the poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{okay, coogan. i'm finished with you for now.}
<A>__{ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before elijah spins to face him.}
<C>__{elijah }
<D>__{but listen. i may not be "mr. tinseltown", but i damn well know what i like. you're gonna be a hideous killing machine, and that's final! tomorrow night i will finish the job onstage! and then, to demonstrate your horrible power, you'll slaughter all the old obsolete freaks in cold bl hey!}
<A>__{elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and zap! he catches toad's ten foot tongue curled around the searing poker inches from the fiddle faddle.}
<C>__{toad}
<D>__{aaagggghh!}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i told you enough!}
