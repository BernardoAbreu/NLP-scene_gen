<B>__{a black void}
<A>__{we can hear movement. strange skittering sounds, like razor claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses... the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an eerie, alien cacophony.}
<B>__{earth}
<A>__{appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. the alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear the muffled thump of what could be a distant explosion. alien text suddenly appears next to earth, and we reveal we are in }
<L>__{interior borg recon center}
<A>__{the image of earth is actually on a monitor, which is only one of dozens of monitors covering a huge wall. we don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre a mixture of organic and mechanical elements. circuitry and optical cabling are side by side with what looks almost like arteries and organs. we can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises. occasionally, a shadowy form sweeps past the camera, vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is. all of the monitors are active, and they present myriad images and sound all related to earth history. the screens show everything from written chinese... to renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel footage of world war two... to what look like clips of space battles from the 24th century. the entire range of human history dancing across the monitors. the effect is dizzying we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race. there is another thump and the wall of monitors shudders slightly. we hear the voice of what we will come to know as the borg collective thousands of voices speaking at once :}
<C>__{borg}
<D>__{restrict search parameters to 1 9 9 8 through 2 0 8 4.}
<A>__{the images on the monitors now change to show us images from 21st century earth history. again, it's a collection of still photography, video footage, text, artwork, etc. we hear snippets of sound bites, music, speeches from the period. a lot of enticing details. as the images race across the monitors, we should learn the following. the turn of the 21st century brought chaos. regional wars, the collapse of the united nations. societal break down. crime, starvation, desperation. a third world war. nuclear explosions, environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. the united states ceases to exist. all political authority vanishes. humanity teetering on the edge of the second dark age. the image of a single man zephram cochrane. a visionary scientist. he see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile. he flies the first warp test, breaking the light barrier. it changes history. grainy black and white images of a vulcan scout ship landing on earth. they saw cochrane's flight, followed him back to earth, and made first contact with the human race. humanity turns the corner. first contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before. humans and vulcans working together, beginning to solve long standing problems with new technology. we see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions. a new world government is formed. people from planet earth and people from vulcan form an alliance. they call it the united federation of planets. and they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration. they call it starfleet. these are images recounting the birth of the star trek universe. another muffled explosion, this one stronger, shakes the entire wall. one of the monitors blows out in a shower of sparks. and now a new voice, a woman's voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic inflection, speaks for the first time:}

<A>__{as the borg sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this is just one small part of }
<B>__{a massive space battle}
<A>__{involving dozens of starfleet and borg vessels, engaged in a fierce firefight as far as the eye can see. ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding. lots of movement. it's a spectacular sight. the borg sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{in the middle of the battle. a borg cube is attacking a smaller federation starship. the starship is taking quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it doesn't look like it can take much more of this. suddenly a spread of four torpedoes come blazing in from o.c. the torpedoes slam into the borg ship, causing massive damage. the uss enterprise ncc 1701 e soars into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship. the enterprise is starfleet's newest and most powerful vessel. an elegant and majestic ship. but unlike the last enterprise, starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory. we get the feeling this enterprise is ready for anything.}
