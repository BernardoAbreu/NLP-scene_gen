<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{agent hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining colonel hardwick and six of my cid staff. because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison.}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{what makes you so sure he was the last cell?}

<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i know the whole story, general.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{you don't know shit. poor suffering sharon and her poor suffering people. it's called "going native" the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it. she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it. and now they're getting exactly what they want, which is the sheik will be back in the mix. but ten times as strong, because now he's the big man who stood up to the americans.}
<P>__{(looks at hub)}
<D>__{i did what was necessary. i make no apologies. if you think you're going to be able to use that file against me, you know even less about politics than i imagined.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{general. i'm not in politics. you can have this back. i won't use it.}
<A>__{hub hands him the file. devereaux takes it.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{because you don't have the balls.}

<A>__{behind them, a commotion as frank and several agents force their way into the room, followed by reporters, who shout questions as strobes and videotape record the arrest.}

<B>__{hundreds of young arab boys}
