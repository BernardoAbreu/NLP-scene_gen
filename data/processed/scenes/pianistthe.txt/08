<L>__{exterior ruined warsaw street day}
<A>__{a column of german soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, march into view. on the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins, smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including szpilman and henryk, and a little behind them, father, craning to see. they watch, expressionless, as the germans march past.}
<L>__{interior warsaw apartment day}
<A>__{regina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers. halina is on a box, removing and replacing books. mother sits at one end of the table, polishing a man's watch and chain. at the other end, father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. henryk is deep in thought and szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin. the apartment has less furniture now and the silver has gone.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(finishing the counting)}
<D>__{five thousand and three.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{yes, five thousand and three zlotys, that's all we've got left.}
<C>__{regina}
<D>__{it's three thousand and three zlotys too much,}
<P>__{(reading from newspaper)}
<D>__{'re: further restrictions regarding liquid assets: jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes.'}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what are we supposed to do with the rest?}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{deposit it in a bank. blocked account.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{banks? who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a german bank?}
<C>__{regina}
<D>__{we could hide the money here in the window frame.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{no, no, no. i will tell you what we'll do. we'll use tried and tested methods. you know what we did in the last war? we made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{and suppose they take the table away?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what d'you mean, take the table away?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{do they?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{idiot! what would they want with a table?}
<A>__{all look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer is coming away at one end. a table like this? he pokes his finger under the veneer. it snaps, revealing bare wood beneath.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what on earth are you doing?}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{there's a good place under the cupboard.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{no, no. listen, i've been thinking }
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{that makes a change.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{you know what we do? we use psychology.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{we use what?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{we leave the money and the watch on the table. and we cover it like this.}
<P>__{(covers it with the newspaper)}
<D>__{in full view. the germans will search high and low, i promise you, they'll never notice it.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{of course they'll notice it. but look }
<P>__{(lifts the violin fingerboard.)}
<D>__{this is a good place for something.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{a good place for what?}
<P>__{(to the others')}
<D>__{he's insane!}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{just shut up.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{my violin?}
<A>__{they all talk at once.}
<C>__{regina}
<D>__{quiet! quiet! order, please, order!}
<C>__{halina}
<D>__{she's a lawyer, she likes order.}
<C>__{regina}
<D>__{listen, just listen. let's come to an agreement. we jam the money in the window frame. the watch we hide under the cupboard. and the chain we put in the violin.}
<A>__{a brief silence.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{will i still be able to play?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{let's find out.}
<A>__{they start to hide the things.}
