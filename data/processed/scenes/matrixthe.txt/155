<A>__{neo looks at morpheus whose body is covered with a cold sweat.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what are they doing to him?}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{they're cracking his mind.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{they inject virus like serums to break down the system. it's like cracking a computer. all it takes is time.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how much time?}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{depends on the mind. but eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.}
<A>__{tank punches several commands on morpheus' personal unit. the monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical one.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{when it does, morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{the access codes to zion.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{if an agent got inside zion's mainframe he could do anything. disable the defense system. it would be the end of us.}
<A>__{he looks up at trinity who is pacing relentlessly.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{we can't let that happen. we have to do it, trinity. zion has to be protected.}
<A>__{trinity sees cypher's dead body. rage overtakes her and she starts kicking hin.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{goddamnit! goddamnit!}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{we have to pull the plug.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{we don't have any other choice.}
<A>__{those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze. she walks past him and gets into her chair.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{trinity, what are you doing?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i'm going in after him.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{morpheus could conform at any minute }
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{if he does i'm sure you'll do what has to be done.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{you saw that place. it's suicide.}
<A>__{she glares at him.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{i know what morpheus means to you }
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{no. no, i don't think you do. if you did, then you would know that i'm not letting him go. not without a fight, tank.}
<A>__{she yanks her harness tight.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{not without a fight.}
