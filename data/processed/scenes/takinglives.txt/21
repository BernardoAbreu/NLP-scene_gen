<L>__{interior task force room day}
<A>__{photos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls. twenty four hour news on a tv. six detectives man the phones. rookies fetch reports, pour coffee.}
<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{the long table is crowded. inspectors laval and reynaud. three more police officials. a pair of city councilmen. grace sits next to gillet.}
<D>__{councilman #1 you found the skull. incredible.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains. councilman #2 so i can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of quebec?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no headhunters, sir. however, a killer is out there. councilman #1 director gillet. do you have the victim identified?}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{no name yet, sir. we have someone from the university recreating his face from the skull. councilman #1 why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he wasn't missed. he had no family, or moved often. he had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. he spent a lot of time in his kayak. councilman #1 the big question is who killed him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{always is, sir. i can give you a rough profile; white male, thirty to thirty four. has some college but no degree. neat in appearance. at least six feet tall. very intelligent. charming when necessary. he uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor. he's killed before and will again unless caught.}
<A>__{laval and reynaud write furiously. gillet is impressed. as are the councilmen.}
<D>__{councilman #1 we really appreciate the fbi sending you. when can we expect your report?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{a couple days, sir.}
