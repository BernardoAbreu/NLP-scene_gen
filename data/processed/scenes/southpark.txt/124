<L>__{exterior south park day}
<A>__{from an extreme wide shot, we see all the forces on both sides exchange firepower. the canadian national anthem can be heard in the distance. we see mr. mackey looking like a natural born killer. he shoots like a maniac into the canadians. he wounds one and then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.}
<C>__{mr. mackey}
<D>__{die canadian, mmkay?!}
<A>__{and he drives the knife into the canadian's chest. but then, suddenly, another canadian soldier appears out of nowhere, and blows a hole through mackey's chest.}
<C>__{mr. mackey}
<D>__{mkay }
<A>__{mackey falls to the ground, dead. just then big gay al runs through the frame, we follow him as he skips his way around gunfire.}
<C>__{big gay al}
<D>__{ooh! goodness those bullets are going fast!!!}
<A>__{another bullet zings by his head.}
<C>__{big gay al}
<D>__{jumping jesus, this is insane!!}
<A>__{thump! a bullet hits big gay al square in the head. more bullets follow, tearing him to shreds. wide angle on entire battle this shot parodies one of the big shots from 'saving private ryan'. just complete overkill. explosions, helicopters, gunfire and death. kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.}
<C>__{stan's mother}
<D>__{my god... this is terrible...}
<A>__{kyle's mother holds out her m 16. she is now completely insane.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{this is what we wanted! we wanted our children to be brought up in a smut free environment!!!}
<C>__{kenny's mother}
<D>__{but we didn't want this. i just followed you 'cause i made a shitload of money selling kenny t shirts!}
<C>__{stan's mother}
<D>__{oh lord, what have we done...?}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{wake up, people! we all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! it's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?}
<A>__{the other mothers look very confused.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{why does it matter?! my plan is a perfect plan!! perfect! perfect! perfect!!!!!}
<A>__{the other mothers walk away.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{where are you going?! we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!}
<C>__{stan's mother}
<D>__{we're going to find our boys! for god's sake sheila, you almost had them killed!!}
<A>__{kyle's mother turns back to the battle. more killing and explosions.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{killed. they should only be so lucky. kyle wasn't even born in a hospital!}
