<L>__{interior crawford's office day}
<A>__{crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless. he takes a deep breath and checks his watch. then he stands, removing the glasses. we now see his office: large, austere. decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip. crawford gets a brand new bottle of jack daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom. he gargles, spits into the sink. he pours out more, then puts the half empty bottle back on his desk. he collects a home made device from the workbench: it looks like a pda connected by wires to a blank credit card. he puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby. crawford goes to a light box, studying a set of large x rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal. tina, his assistant, appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{the n.t.s.b. guys are here.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(doesn't look up)}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{she hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle. crawford ignores her, pulling an x ray off the light box and grabbing his jacket which knocks over the bottle. it skitters across the desk, liquor spilling. crawford just walks out past tina.}
