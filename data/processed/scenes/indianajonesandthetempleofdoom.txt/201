<L>__{172. exterior the rope bridge}
<A>__{willie and short round pull themselves up at the end of the bridge. behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines. what's in front of them is hardly more reassuring the rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely wasn't built by army engineers. laying across the two bottom rope spans, worm eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings. vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope spans to the two up per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand railings. short round steps tentatively out onto the bridge. it holds him and he turns and smiles at willie }
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{easy like pie! kid's stuff!}
<A>__{suddenly the board under him breaks! willie grabs short round before he falls into the abyss! looking pale and less cocky, short round starts out again and willie follows his carefully. they continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear stopping up and down movement. behind them, indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge. he stands up and sees willie and short round halfway across already. then he hears something and turns quickly he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two thuggee guards rush out. indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck the guard spills forward and trips the second guard. the first man tries to stand but indiana kicks him in the head. the second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword indy ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's sword. he grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd attempts to slice him in two! indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en gage in a sword duel with the enraged thuggee guard. indy looks at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide the best way to use it suddenly the guard shouts and charges. indy decides shouting must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly the two swords clang and spark as the duel erupts. indy flails and feints and the thuggee guard lunges and slashes. indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt. keeping the sword, indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as quickly as possible across the rickety span. he hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge. the guards suprise willie and shorty as they finally get across the bridge. struggling futilely with the guards, willie shouts at indiana }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{indy looks out behind you!}
<A>__{indy sees more thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind him. he turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured willie and short round coming across the bridge in front of him. indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below! a wind comes up and the high priest, mola ram, appears on the far end of the bridge. he stands with the guards who hold willie and short round. the wind whips around indy and he staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches mola ram }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{let my friends go!}
<A>__{mola ram shouts in hindi and the guards start to move toward indy from both sides of the bridge.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{that's far enough!}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{you are in no position to give orders, dr. jones.}
<A>__{indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you want the stones, let them go and call off your guards!}
<A>__{mola ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of the bridge suddenly indiana swings the sword and it cuts into one of the bottom rope spans! the rope is half severed and frays slowly under the tension!}
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{impressive, dr. jones. but i don't believe you would kill yourself!}
<A>__{mola ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now) step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to indy from both sides. indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope span! it, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly. the bridge jolts and indy and the guards sway precariously! suddenly mola ram shoves short round out onto the bridge. the high priest draws a dagger and pushes willie onto the swaying span, holding the knife behind them both.}
<C>__{mola ram }
<D>__{your friends will die with you!}
<A>__{in different times this would be called a mexican stand off indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him. he sees willie and short round out on the bridge now with mola ram at their backs.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{then i guess we're all going to take a big dive!}
<A>__{indy and short round's eyes meet and the kid realizes that his hero isn't kidding. willie looks at shout round anxiously she notices that shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support. petrified, willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm }
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{give me the stones!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{mola ram you're about to meet kali in hell!}
<A>__{indiana swings the sword with all his might it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes ! immediately mola ram's guards start to flee in panic too late! indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed the rope bridge is sheared in two! it breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart! the guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! willie and short round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge. mola ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats below them, indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang ling from its moorings at the top. there's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive. short round and willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge. below them, mola ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life. short round and willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats. finally, short round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help willie up. meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, indy reaches up and grabs mola ram's leg. the high priest kicks and tries to break indy's grip. he kicks again and smashes indy in the face. indy won't let go. suddenly the high priest reaches up and grabs his own thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt mola ram shoves the luckless guard down onto indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming thuggee. indy manages to hang on. the thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death. then mola ram looks across the gorge and yells. indy sees a dozen of the last thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge. indy starts climbing up after mola ram again. he grabs at the back of mola ram's robe and pull him down. slipping, mola ram turns and it's indy's chance to punch mola ram in the face. mola ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent ly. he grabs the strap of indy's shoulder bag and stamps on in dy's hand indy falls! indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something meanwhile, mola ram now has the bag with the sankara stones. indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge. across the gorge, the thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge. the guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions at the top of the bridge, mola ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above willie and short round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm. indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength. he reaches for a wooden slat suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood! indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him! across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows. indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu ing bursts of fiery arrows. at the top, mola ram reaches up des perately for a hand old willie smashes his hand with a rock! the high priest yells in pain and slips down to where indy slugs him again in the face! they struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them. on the cliff above the fallen bridge, willie watches the fire rising toward indy and mola ram as they fight. short round turns and sees something }
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{willie, look!}
<A>__{they see horses galloping through a narrow pass the british cavalry is returning. captain blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly. a fussilade of flaming arrows force the british to take cover they quickly start firing back at the thuggees with rifles. as the battle above the gorge continues, indy and mola ram fight below on the dangling bridge indiana sees the high priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely. mola ram's hand thrusts out toward indiana's chest and indy yells in pain indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees mola ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)! mola ram's finger are inching into indy's body indy clutches at mola ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart. slowly, indy is able to push mola ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from indy's chest. indiana suddenly slugs the high priest in the face and grabs for the bag of sankara stones }
<C>__{mola ram}
<D>__{no, the stones are mine!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you're betrayed shiva. (he re peats in sanskrit sankara's warn }

<A>__{as indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and starts to burn mola ram as he clutches it the stones begin to spill out of the bag and the high priest grabs from them.}
<C>__{indiana }
<P>__{(he repeats sankara's warning in sanskrit)}
<A>__{the blazing stones sear mola ram's flesh and he screams in pain. the light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at indy as if awakened from a nightmare mola ram loses his balance and indy grabs for the stones. he manages to clutch only one of them as mola ram screams and falls! indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool. he watches mola ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom. the irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more but soon wel come the meal that just dropped in. jaws flash and teeth rip at the high priest's likeless corpse. and indy's bag with the sankara stones sinks into the murkly cur rent and disappears down the river ...}
