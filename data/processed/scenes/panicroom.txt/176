<L>__{interior entry floor night}
<A>__{meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open the big front door. on the stoop, the two cops turn to look at her. she acts as if she's just been awakened. she looks it, too, still in t shirt and boxer shorts. the wind is gusty and cold outside.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{what are you guys what time is it?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{'bout four o'clock.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{we got a call...}
<A>__{cop 1 looks at him. cop 2 stops talking.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{somebody called you?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{can we come in?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{we'd like to come in.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no, you can't come in.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{can we come in?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{stop asking me that. i'm fine. who called you?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{you don't look so good.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{you wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me i look like hell? of course i look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, jack. i'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can i go?}
<A>__{cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her t shirt, the black smudges still on her face.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{your husband says you said "there are three..." right before you got cut off.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{oh, that phone call...}
<A>__{cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to hear him.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{ma'am, if there's something you want to say to us right now that maybe you can't say to us right now, maybe you just want to make a signal, by blinking a few times, something like that.}
<A>__{she just looks at him. wow, this guy's intuitive. she is sorely tempted. but she can't.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{that's something you could do. safely.}
<A>__{she thinks, thinks and burst out laughing.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{man, you are good! you mean, like, if somebody was in the house or something? that's great, they really train you guys these days, don't they?}
<A>__{cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no. i'm fine. cross my heart.}
<A>__{cop 2 turns to go, but cop 1 lingers.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{may i ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(stalling)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{the sentence that started "there are three." what was the rest?}
<A>__{pause. she stares at him.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{okay, look. my husband and i just broke up. it's my first night in the new house, and i was feeling a little lonely and a little drunk. the sentence, if you insist on knowing, was going to be "there are three things i will do for you if you come over right now and get in bed with me."}
<A>__{cop 2 stifles a laugh.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{but thank god i came to my senses before i said all that and hung up instead, so nobody would ever know what i was thinking, unless, of course, two policemen showed up in the middle of the night to interrogate me about it.}
<A>__{that was good. cop 1 is embarrassed. cop 2 thinks it's funny.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{you want her to show you which three things, rick, or should we just go?}
<A>__{cop 1 looks at meg, a long look, he holds it for one last moment, trying to read her mind. on the monitors, we see the video image of the cops as they turn and head away down the front steps. meg closes the doors, looks up into a camera, right at us. in the panic room, burnham and raoul breathe a sigh of relief. burnham goes back to work on the safe. he's making progress. raoul looks at sarah. stares actually. he's thinking too. bad thoughts. he moves over, crouches down next to burnham.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{she saw my face. the kid too.}
<A>__{sarah overhears that. she raises her head, alarmed. burnham turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back down in time. burnham and raoul close themselves off, for a private conversation. sarah edges closer. she overhears a fragment.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{that's your problem.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{that's their problem.}
<A>__{sarah is terrified. doesn't know what to do. she looks to her immediate left, sees the intercom panel. she edges closer.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you finish. then we finish.}
<A>__{sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button "all page."}
