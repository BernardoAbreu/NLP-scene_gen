<L>__{exterior suburban street day}
<A>__{the two men come out the back door and cut through the hedge. miller's car, a pontiac sunbird, is parked at the curb. hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard. holsters his gun. a neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail. hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{where you want it, mike? head or gut?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{listen, joe, i }
<P>__{(stops, sighs)}
<D>__{gut.}
<A>__{hallenbeck pats the dog. straightens. plants his back foot and spins. punches like a sledgehammer, into miller's gut. miller drops to his knees. begins to retch. hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. lights it.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{if i see you again, i will kill you.}
<A>__{miller nods weakly. gasping for breath.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{so. west hollywood at seven, right?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{huh...?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{the job. seven o'clock, right?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you still... want the job...?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{it's two hundred bucks.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah. i guess it is.}
<A>__{he climbs to his feet, still doubled over.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm sorry, joe.}
<A>__{hallenbeck says nothing. miller turns and stumbles to his car. hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. a dead mask. he walks back toward the hedge. the neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth. behind him, mike miller gets into the sunbird. hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. throws it. the dog barks and bounds after it. mike miller turns the key in the ignition. the car blows to pieces. an eruption of flame. flying glass and metal. the car becomes airborne. engulfed in fire. does a lazy spin. comes down. the shockwave catches hallenbeck. slams him ass over teacups. windows blow in up and down the street. smoke and fire roll to the sky. the dog cowers, howling in fear. beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. hallenbeck rolls to his feet. covered with twigs and leaves. clothing scorched. stares. eyes glazed.}
