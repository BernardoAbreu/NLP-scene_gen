<L>__{interior short hall night}
<A>__{an hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes. hull walks past him and out the back door. from inside we see hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun clattering away from him. a couple that had been making out, stops, looks. it takes hull a moment to gather himself. he picks up the gun, gets into elias's car. it drives away.}
