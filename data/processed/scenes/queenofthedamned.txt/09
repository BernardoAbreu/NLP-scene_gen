<L>__{exterior new orleans house night}
<A>__{in the street, lestat emerges from the shadows in the dealer's snug fitting leather outfit. he looks up at an extremely run down flophouse...}
<C>__{lestat }
<D>__{my old house.}
<A>__{high in the attic, a single window glows with dim light. the source of the music. the whole house is shaking from the sound of the band playing upstairs.}
<L>__{interior attic just after}
<A>__{the room booms with music, speakers stacked high on all sides, literally shaking the house to its foundations. reveal the band members of satan's night out. james, alex and maudy stare at each other as if in some tantric trance, as they play their music alex's long fingers climbing up and down his guitar, maudy's waifish body sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music flowing through them while james, on drums, drives them further into it.}
<C>__{lestat }
<D>__{it was hard to believe these beings were mortal so confident in their skin. everything in my body wanted to be with them. i couldn't help myself.}
<A>__{then, from somewhere in the room, an angelic voice begins to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in exquisite harmony. arching her neck in some higher ecstasy, maudy looks across the makeshift studio and suddenly stops playing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what the hell, maudy.}
<A>__{seeing maudy's stunned face, alex and james turn to see lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb of the guitars. slowly opening his cool grey eyes }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{please don't stop.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what the f how did you get in here?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the door, of course.}
<A>__{james and alex look at the door on the other side of the attic they should have seen him. maudy stares at lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks drinking maudy in with his eyes }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your music woke me from the longest sleep. it's sublime. in two hundred years i've never heard anything quite like it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{lestat }
<D>__{the question provoked an irresistible urge...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you may call me the vampire lestat.}
<A>__{as we remain on the stunned looks of the band's faces }
<C>__{lestat }
<D>__{it just rolled out of my mouth. with one simple sentence i had betrayed everything about my kind. betrayed our code of secrecy.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your struggles are over.}
<A>__{suddenly from across the room }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{all that you've ever dreamed of will be yours.}
<A>__{they spin around to see lestat now right behind them, smiling.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your lucky day.}
<A>__{they all stare at him, faces white. a beat. then james breaks into a big smile.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{cool. we got our very own vampire.}
<A>__{maudy and alex look at each other getting used to it. they break into smiles, going with it.}
<C>__{maudy}
<D>__{hey, vampire lestat, i've always wondered... about keith richards...}
