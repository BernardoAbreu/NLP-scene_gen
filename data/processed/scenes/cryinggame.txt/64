<L>__{interior metro night.}
<A>__{the place is hopping. fergus enters. he now sees it as he should have seen it the first night as a transvestite bar. he makes his way through the crowds. all the women too heavily made up. some beautifully sleek young things he looks at he realizes are young men. he makes his way to the bar where dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it. her face is bruised. she is wearing dark glasses. as he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. she talks to col the barman.}
