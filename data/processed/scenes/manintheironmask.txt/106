<L>__{exterior road night}
<A>__{aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees. the musketeers and phillippe pile out, to find another much grander carriage there waiting. aramis ushers them into it.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{whose carriage is this?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it was mine. but since you are about to be the king, it is yours.}
<A>__{the new carriage lurches away.}
<B>__{inside the new carriage}
<A>__{are bundles of elaborate clothes.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{phillippe first.}
<A>__{they begin to dress phillippe in a masquerade costume.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{remember, phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{hold your goblet with two fingers.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{and make love as if you don't care. the way kings do. and fart whenever you wish.}
<A>__{aramis tucks a note into phillippe's pocket.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{remember, all you have to do is get through tonight. smile and nod a lot, and if you get stuck just wave and announce, "continue." in the morning you hand this note to d'artagnan, pardoning athos and instructing that he, aramis and porthos be brought to the palace as your advisors. and all is well.}
<A>__{phillippe nods; everyone's nervous. aramis grabs more clothes and hands them out.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{now the rest of us.}
