<A>__{the star man presses on through the trees. he hears a light plane overhead. he stops and watches until the branches cut off his view. a path between two logs leads him to the tip of a promontory. from behind the cedars growing there, he sits and looks down on the center of eau claire. arm in arm, a young couple meander through the trees. the boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is disheveled. without seeing him, they walk past the star man crouched in a thicket of small pines. after they've gone by, he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the highway.}
