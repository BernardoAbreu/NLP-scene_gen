<B>__{the ambulance}
<A>__{jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a fiery ball. in the foreground, hawk's gurney coasts down a peaceful off road hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle fear, comes to a tranquil gurney wheels gently squeaking stop. lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness, carrying a steel suitcase. he kneels before hawk and opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara tus. he begins mumbling into a cellular phone. a malevolent, silent deadpan wraith passes him and approaches hawk. both men are dressed in outfits that seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute couture. on the fingers of one wraith hand is carved the word hate. on the other hand is the word frog. the frog hand hands a befuddled hawk a card. it reads: my name is kit}
<B>__{kat and this is not a dream.}
<A>__{hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as kit kat chops his neck, knocking him off the gurney. the sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.}

<D>__{whoops, forgot....}
<A>__{she deftly kicks hawk across the face. hawk angrily bounds back up until he sees the biggest member of the group fe fi fo fum his way toward them. suddenly, the giant clumsily trips over snickers' suitcase apparatus and ram collapses into hawk and the gurney. laying atop hawk, butterfinger goofily speaks...}
