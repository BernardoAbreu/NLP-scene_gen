<A>__{chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids. the whitewater roars. as we slowly zoom into chris' face, terrified and absorbed by the torrent, a bead of sweat drops across his forehead, tilts our camera to his trembling hands and legs, when peter gabriel's i have the touch begins to play.}

<A>__{zoom into chris' face...a decision: fear becomes determination we smash cut on cue : with peter gabriel's vocals. slo mo, super dramatic chris blasting out of a shoot in the rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. it's outrageous. hair raising. just like peter gabriel sings it, he has the touch. this kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on rapids. but it's that immortal stage of life, no care, no helmet, no life jacket, pure adrenaline. he can hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's no looking back now. and with every thump of the music, we share his rush. his pure unadulterated exhilaration. with the culmination of the music, chris has successfully shot the rapid. he paddles through quiet waters. we move in on him as he maneuvers the kayak to face upstream. there before him, the impossible rapid he had just completed.}

<A>__{he feels immortal. he makes his about face and is about to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a group of river tourists and their guide lunching beside a pontoon raft. the tourists look like a bunch of bewildered tubby troopers in their misfitted orange life vests and cereal bowl helmets. the river guide yells out at chris as chris moves past camera and away. the guide gets on his satellite phone to alert the rangers. we zoom slowly away from them toward the rapid.}
