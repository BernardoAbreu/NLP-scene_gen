<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{ms. rain's desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a semi circle. four of them are occupied by girls roughly precious' age: rhonda johnson african american, stocky and even taller than precious, rita romero latin descent, medium build, friendly face and dressed entirely in black, jermaine hicks wiry, lean, seated and dressed like a boy and consuelo montenegro latin descent, petite glowing and gorgeous. she twirls her hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips. a seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows. the girls all stare up at precious blankly as she enters the room. precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she gazes around from the girls to ms. rain to the clouds outside the windows.}

<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{does everyone have her notebook?}
