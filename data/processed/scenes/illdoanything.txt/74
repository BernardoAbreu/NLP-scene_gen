<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i mean i haven't been to bed with anyone since jeannie got here... i haven't talked to anyone the way i need to.}
<P>__{(cradling her breast)}
<D>__{i haven't seen anything this beautiful. i haven't felt this good about life. i mean, i've been lonely, cathy.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(as he enters her)}
<D>__{i will tell you the truth, matt. i've never felt more like turning my phone off.}
<A>__{she twists her body gracefully, sexily towards the phone.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you can't shut the phone off. i left this number with jeannie's sitter.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i don't understand what you're worried about.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm not worried. but if the phone was off, i would worry.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{but i get a lot of calls.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i could put the machine on 'monitor,' but it's going to be... i don't know.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it will be okay. i think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone. turn it off, monitor, whatever.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she twists toward the phone again not quite so beautifully.}
<B>__{other angle}
<A>__{as she hits the "monitor" button, then turns back to him.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you look so serious.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i am so serious.}
<A>__{cathy's pov matt totally there... this is major for him, then he does something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth of his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help it.}
<B>__{on cathy}
<A>__{she likes him.}
<B>__{the couple}
<A>__{as they make love... their union thrown off kilter by the phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and sweat towards intimacy.}
<C>__{younger male voice}
<P>__{(broadly)}
<D>__{hi, cathy... all my magazines came today... read the new vanity fair, they take apart three people we hate... spy is bad this month... scorsese didn't get the time cover, the plane crash did... ha, ha, ha... why aren't you at the office? you know, i'm getting to the point where i prefer to reach people's machines... bye.}
<A>__{the love making continues as the calls continue.}
<C>__{male d person voice}
<D>__{cathy? are you there? hello... are you there?? i'm going to count to ten. one, two, three...}
<P>__{(then to someone passing his office)}
<D>__{did you go to the screening last night? what did you think? that makes two bombs in a row for her.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{...four, five, six... pick up if you're there. i've got major gossip... major screwup. it could be good for us.}
<A>__{cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone... she shakes it off.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{is this the kind of crap you listen to all day?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{please, we're making love here.}
<C>__{burke's voice}
<P>__{(incredibly depressed)}
<D>__{if the tv show bombs, there's going to be a dance party on my grave. i don't give a crap. nothing seems to have a point anymore. i'm really questioning everything... including action adventure... don't tell anyone i'm down. even destroy the message tape. don't tell anyone i said to destroy the message tape. don't even give hints that there's something you can't tell them, but you wish you could... i'm losing it. i'm losing it. i'm losing it. don't tell nobody. don't tell nobody. don't tell nobody.}
<A>__{the sound of a hang up... the couple having more difficulty making love...}
<B>__{on cathy and matt}
<A>__{as they look to the phone and react still joined, then:}
<C>__{jeannie's voice}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{daddy...}
<P>__{(berating someone who is with her)}
<D>__{you dialed bad... where is he?}
<C>__{lucy's voice}
<P>__{(with jeannie coaching b.g.)}
<D>__{matt, jeannie is very upset because you are not here when you said. and now the big hand is on the eight...}
<A>__{the sound of a hangup... as matt springs from the bed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(as he leaves)}
