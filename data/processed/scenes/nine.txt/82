<A>__{...and the cry is now in guido's mouth, on top of carla in the spasm of sex... he suddenly can't breathe... carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... he rolls over, recovers slowly. as always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what? what?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i can't breathe, i can't breathe.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{guido, don't die on me! can you imagine... poor luigi! it would kill him.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(finding her ridiculous)}
<D>__{if i die it would kill your husband?}
<A>__{guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{no, that's not what i meant, guidino. no. where are you going?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i have to go to work. carla, i can't breathe.}
<A>__{guido stands up and picks up his shirt. he puts it on whilst they argue.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{let me come with you.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{because it's impossible. please.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{but why is it impossible? look at your producer! he's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. guido. everybody knows about me. why? why won't you let me near you?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{for the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. it's not fair to your husband. it's not fair to my wife.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{see, you're playing with me. you're twisting everything... please let me come with you.}
