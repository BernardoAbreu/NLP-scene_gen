<L>__{exterior later that day surf's up wave pool}
<A>__{the three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge. one of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team. alex is the one in the sweats for concessions. slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay down. the grounds kid is the littlest guy of all. a judge blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water. they lie them down on a clear area and begin cpr. the guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin cpr. they are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained. we move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced. one girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card.. we move again to see the concessions kids, who are in trouble. alex is lying there dying, and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth. they form a circle over him, pointing and arguing. finally they all just walk off and alex is still lying on the ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene. the judges take their notes.}
