He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead. The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin. The boy's eyes snap open. Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue to drone. Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE. The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else. Jacob frowns. The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob immediately turns back to him.}

The hull of the cabin buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside.

It's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox. The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says THOMPSON.

There's a Jack-in-a-box with its head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes. Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater. Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!! Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY. The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure. There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf. She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a CRASH. FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs. Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the hallway.  Karen raises the bat. And Jacob appears.
