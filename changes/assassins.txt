<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK}
<ACTION>__{We know that we are looking at something because its polished surface shimmers with light. PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and white tiles of a chess board. The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess game. The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies unravel towards a final outcome. Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black king. We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold black eyes...}

<LOC>__{EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK}
<ACTION>__{The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens. Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end- less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the mire. The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man. He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand. His name is ROBERT RATH. The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the brambles and mud. As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the mud.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Aw-shit!}
<ACTION>__{He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud. He looks at Rath.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How much farther?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.}
<ACTION>__{About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, fuck it.}
<ACTION>__{He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud. He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off, laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud. Rath waits, a faint smile. He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark, wet earth.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, this feels kinda good.}
<ACTION>__{They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why not?}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My Margaret... I loved her but you know what?  I cheated on her.  All the time.  I don't even know why. It wasn't the sex, Margaret was great in bed.  I think if I wasn't married I wouldn't have even looked at some of those women.  I knew she couldn't trust me, so how could I trust her?  If she was here right now I'd think that I would tell her that I was sorry... 'course, if she were here right now, maybe I wouldn't feel like talking.}
<ACTION>__{He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think I've heard of you.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's possible.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're pretty famous aren't you?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I hope not.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's a common question.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A dime.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Average.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit... oh well.}
<ACTION>__{Ketcham laughs.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Taken.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's exactly what I told myself.}
<ACTION>__{Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like he's high.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I always wondered what I'd be thinking at this exact moment.  I imagined that I would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this, trying to figure out who it was...}
<ACTION>__{Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't know.  That's how it works.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you thinking about?}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And an R.C.}
<ACTION>__{He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I ask you something?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Go ahead.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do other guys do?}
<ACTION>__{He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Some.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I ask you a question?}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anything.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why didn't you fade?}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You mean quit?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I always pictured that I would end in some land fill, under someone else's garbage.  I kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some baby's green shit, covering me.  But this is nice...}
<ACTION>__{He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black horizon.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{Ketcham stares at the last of the light.}
<CHAR>__{KETCHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice... real nice.}
<ACTION>__{With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry. Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand. When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark- ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SHOTS.}
<ACTION>__{Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud, a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze left by the dying sun. Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand- ing alone in the middle of nowhere.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The room is dark and still. A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light. Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the city's electric night. The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window. In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath. Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below. He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door. Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(WOMAN)}
<DIAL>__{Hi.  Did you call --}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.  Please come in.}
<ACTION>__{Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Goodness, it's so dark...}
<ACTION>__{She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I prefer it like this.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How can a beautiful man like you be shy?}
<ACTION>__{He smiles.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I prefer it, that's all.}
<ACTION>__{She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's okay, honey.  We can do it anyway you want.}
<ACTION>__{Rath is obviously uncomfortable.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would you like a drink?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.}
<ACTION>__{They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows. She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a city night.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Beautiful.}
<ACTION>__{He hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good will towards men.}
<ACTION>__{Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she drinks at all, we can not tell.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why are you working today?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.}
<ACTION>__{She touches his face, the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're very good at this aren't you?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think you're supposed to answer that question.}
<ACTION>__{Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know what you expect, but I don't want...}
<ACTION>__{He pours himself another drink.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I called because I just want... I need to talk.}
<ACTION>__{She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've been thinking about my life, about things I have done... What I do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do.}
<ACTION>__{He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know that everything has a price.  I want you to understand that I'm willing to pay.}
<ACTION>__{He takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For what?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Honesty.}
<ACTION>__{She puts the envelope down.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I just want to ask you some questions.}
<ACTION>__{Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for the right words.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you ever regret things you've done?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Everyone regrets something.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sometimes.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you think about their wives or their families?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.}
<ACTION>__{Rath nods.  His next question is barely audible.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you ever think about starting over?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All the time.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you tell me about it?}
<ACTION>__{For the first time we really see her take a drink.  She closes her eyes.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sometimes I dream that I meet a man, this good, honest man and we fall in love.  I imagine us living on a boat, reading books, sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did.}
<ACTION>__{She opens her eyes and looks at him.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And what if you never meet that man?}
<ACTION>__{She smiles.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then, I'll sail alone.}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you believe that?}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you asking me if I believe in another life?}
<ACTION>__{Rath nods.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have to.}
<ACTION>__{She finishes her drink.}
<CHAR>__{ESCORT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that all you want?}
<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{She picks up the money and stands.}

<ACTION>__{It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about. He has been here for a while. He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the same positions as in the opening sequence. He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and then finishes off another bottle of bourbon. He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a black rook. A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He gets up and shifts to the other side of the board, studying the game from white's perspective. Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through it as he moves around the table, returning to his place behind the black king. The games reaches its end as black is check-mated. He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the white king.}

<ACTION>__{Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer. On the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled and cleaned, spread out on a white towel. He types in a complicated access code sequence, then waits, staring at the blank screen.}
<DIAL>__{CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Where have you been, Robert? RATH/SCREEN Sick.  The flu. CONTRACTOR/SCREEN I don't believe you.}

<CHAR>__{RATH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts -- RATH/SCREEN I need a rest. CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN That's impossible, Robert.  You're at the top of your field.  These are the best contracts.  To stop now would be self-destructive.}

<DIAL>__{You fucking should be -- RATH/SCREEN Don't be.}
<ACTION>__{On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears.  Rath slowly gets out of his chair. The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk. Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything he can get his hands on.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY}

<ACTION>__{Rath is working at the desk.  He is tallying numbers, materials, totaling his estimate. Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by bodyguards. The file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his income tax return. Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the modem and makes a call. The network comes on-line as the General Contractor types:}

<DIAL>__{RATH/SCREEN Who? CONTRACTOR/SCREEN A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.}
<ACTION>__{The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe.}
<DIAL>__{CONTRACTOR/SCREEN You know what must be done.}
<ACTION>__{The screen goes black as the network shuts down. Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma."}
<LOC>__{EXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian restaurant.}
<LOC>__{INT. TRATTORIA ROMA}
<ACTION>__{It is a large establishment with many tables and booths. The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian families who have been eating here for years. Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian. In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine. He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies the room. LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian. The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over- sized booth in the back. Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin. Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the room. A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles. They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back to the kitchen. At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses. It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is BAIN.  He smiles. The goon reaches for his gun as -- Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He screams. Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm. It happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead. Leevio screams.}

<DIAL>__{Don't!}
<ACTION>__{A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT. Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table. Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON from his belt expecting an attack. Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who moves or stands, men or women. There is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling to the ground, scrambling under tables. Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other. The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing. He moves through the room, watching, searching.}

<ACTION>__{Electra flies across the living room to the monitors. She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel. On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking her phone messages.  One from her mother. Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire apartment is in front of her. On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room. Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath. Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out. Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just been. Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that she had dropped on the table and sorts through it. Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though he knew she couldn't see him. He moves into a room, just as she moves out. Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is unable to turn away. Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts undressing for her bath. He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom. If Jennifer would turn around she would see him. Electra is about to run, to call out when -- Something catches Bain's eye. He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is looking straight up into the camera. He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed. Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra. Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers --}

You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.}

<DIAL>__{Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.}

<ACTION>__{She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD. When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him.}
