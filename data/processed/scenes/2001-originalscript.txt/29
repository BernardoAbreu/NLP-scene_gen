<D>__{hello, dave. now, i'm going to play for you a pre taped briefing which had been stored in hal's memory and would have been played for you by mission commmander kaminsky, when he had been revived. the briefing is by doctor heywood floyd. here it is...}
<A>__{floyd's recorded briefing.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{good day, gentlemen. when you see this briefing, i presume you will be nearing your destination, saturn. i hope that you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. i should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which mission commander kaminsky will have already briefed you. thirteen months before the launch date of your saturn mission, on april 12th, 2001, the first evidence for intelligent life outside the earth was discovered. it was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater tycho. no news of this was ever announced, and the event had been kept secret since then, for reasons which i will later explain. soon after it was uncovered, it emitted a powerful blast of radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the lunar sunrise. luckily for those at the site, it proved harmless. perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at saturn. a lot of thought went into the question of whether or not it was sun triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun powered device. burying it could only shield it from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable. we finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself. what is its purpose? i wish we knew. the object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primitive man apes. we've examined dozens of theories, but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm. what the purpose of the alarm is, why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us? these are questions no one can answer. the intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. in view of this, the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcement might lead to significant cultural shock and}
<C>__{floyd }
<D>__{disorientation. discussion took place at the highest levels between governments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary. this is, of course, why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need to know basis. and now i should like to show you a tv monitor tape of the actual signaling event.}

<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{those who had begun the expriment so long ago had not been men. but when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt awe and wonder – and loneliness. in their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution. they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night. and because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than mind, they encouraged its dawning everywhere. the great dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system, after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years. they swept past the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth. for years they studied, collected and catalogued. when they had learned all they could, they began to modify. they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean, but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years. they were patient, but they were not yet immortal. there was much to do in this universe of a hundred billion stars. so they set forth once more across the abyss, knowing that they would never come this way again. nor was there any need. their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest. on earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them, the changeless moon still carried its secret. with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice, the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy. strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to their successors. earth was not forgotten, but it was one of a million silent worlds, a few of which would ever speak. then the first explorers of earth, recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies, passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created, and who now trnscended them in every way. for a few thousand years, they shared their universe with their machine children; then, realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done, they passed into history without regret.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet earth again. but even the age of the machine entities passed swiftly. in their ceaseless experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light. they could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny of matter. now, they were lords of the galaxy, and beyond the reach of time. they could rove at will among the stars, and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. but despite their god like powers, they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago. the companion of saturn knew nothing of this, as it orbited in its no man's land between mimas and the outer edge of rings. it had only to remember and wait, and to look forever sunward with its strange senses. for many weeks, it had watched the approaching ship. its long dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them. and it recognised what was climbing starward from the sun. if it had been alive, it would have felt excitement, but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers. even if the ship had passed it by, it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment. it had waited four million years; it was prepared to wait for eternity. presently, it felt the gentle touch of radiations, trying to probe its secrets. now, the ship was in orbit and it began to speak, with prime numbers from one to eleven, over and over again. soon, these gave way to more complex signals at many frequencies, ultra violet, infra red, x rays. the machine made no reply. it had nothing to say. then it saw the first robot probe, which descended and hovered above the chasm. then, it dropped into darkness. the great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent; but it was too simple, too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now. then the}

<D>__{pod came, carrying life. the great machine searched its memories. the logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last fainterior glow of the reflected saturnian light. in a moment of time, too short to be measured, space turned and twisted upon itself.}
