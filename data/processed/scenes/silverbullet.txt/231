<A>__{we pan their faces, stopping on joe haller. now something is happening to joe's face. it is bulging, changing. he looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. the pupils are split. he grins, showing big teeth. they are all changing. among the things we see are: pete sylvester, who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling. he grabs andy fairton and the two of them grapple in the aisle. a young woman with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the young woman's own hands are turning into claws. tammy sturmfuller changing; peltzer the druggist changing; the zinneman brothers changing. at the organ, mrs. bowie is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands. she sounds like jerry lee lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. and now the tune changes from the remnants of "bringing in the sheaves." it changes into the rheingold jingle.}
