<L>__{interior office building day}
<A>__{a sign on an office door says "concert ticket agency." from inside we hear someone talking loudly on the phone. chulo, rick and o'neill open the door and go inside. on the walls in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters advertising rock bands like men at work, the clash and barry manilow. behind a cluttered desk we find a little man with a thin mustache and horn rimmed glasses. this is gary melnitz, wheeler dealer, entrepreneur and coward. gary yells a lot, which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex.}
