<A>__{they watch... on the monitor her body twisting, contorting. her suit, ripping apart. screaming. she convulses. her body falling.}

<D>__{what is this, beth? you taking valium?}
<A>__{beth, looking into the microscope.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{sedatives. whatever my mood calls for.}
<A>__{norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 leagues under the sea.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{where'd this come from?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{the library.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{we have a library?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{a bad one. it was the only book in there. norman, come here, look at this.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no, thank you. i hate jellyfish.}
<A>__{walking toward her...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{... when i was six, my younger brother and i we went swimming in the pacific. at my mother's beach house. we both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. killed him.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{my gosh, norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{yeah, it was awful.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what about you? what happened to you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{me? well, i was wrapped in seaweed. it itched for a while, but i survived.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. then jellyfish?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{normally, i'd say no. everything's quiet now no ships, no divers, no electricity. makes sense. but what's curious is these aren't normal jellyfish.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what do you mean not normal?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{they have six tentacles. a new species. and the squid too. they had no stomach.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you knew about the squid not being normal. before fletcher went out there?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah, why?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and you didn't tell anyone?}
<A>__{beth, nervous...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what? why...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth }
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i mean, i'm not... i wasn't absolutely sure if... they }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they are or they aren't. which is it?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what?... wait. don't... why are you }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{nobody said... norman... what? why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth }
<A>__{she backs away from norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it shatters on the floor. she starts breaking down. norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass, hurriedly...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i didn't do anything wrong. i didn't mean...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth.}
<A>__{she's crying, glass in her hands. she looks up at norman, frightened, nervous...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you wouldn't go and tell the others, would you?}
<A>__{norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him away.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i hate this place, norman. i want out.}
