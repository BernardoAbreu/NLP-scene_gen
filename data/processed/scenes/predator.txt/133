<L>__{exterior hunter's p.o.v. of schaefer day}
<A>__{closing rapidly...another few yard. back to scene schaefer runs like a madman, the sound of the hunter's footsteps close behind. he's losing ground. he knows he's going to die. schaefer shouts. suddenly the ground before him collapses and he disappears from sight.}
<L>__{exterior canyon wall day}
<A>__{in a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, schaefer crashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free falling into space. with a sickening impact, he hits the branches of the first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet, through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing for limbs and branched to break his fall. he hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees, impacting crosschest on a large branch, knocking his wind out. semi conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving river.}
