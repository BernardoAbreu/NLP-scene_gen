<T>__{on andrew and joe:}
<A>__{andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have receded,his weight is up. he's in a stage of recovery.}
<T>__{on the other lawyers:}
<A>__{charles wheeler (seeming ironic) and walter kenton (he's pissed) lead the battalion. behind them, walk young lawyers belinda conine and jerome green. belinda is white, jerome is black.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{hushed voices (interior day) ... a judge's chambers, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a loose circle, like a casual living room. joe and andrew whisper to each other. the wyant wheeler team takes up several chairs. belinda conine and jerome green sit next to wheeler and kenton. some of their assistants stand. wheeler is looking across the room at... andrew, who catches wheeler's stare.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{you're looking better, andy. how do you feel?}
<A>__{silence. everyone watches andrew for his reaction.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{fine, thanks, charles.}
<A>__{judge lucas garnett enters his chambers (not wearing a judge's robe). he shakes hands with wheeler and kenton.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{charles, walter...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{congratulations on the new grandson.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{thank you. we're very happy.}
<A>__{the judge brushes by joe and andrew without a word. the room becomes silent as the judge takes a seat.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{attorney for the plaintiff?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{joseph miller, your honor. macready and shilts legal services.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{i've seen your television commercials. "if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... it should say, "through the negligence of others."}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will take that under consideration, your honor.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{on behalf of the defendants?}
<C>__{belinda conine}
<D>__{belinda conine. of petersen, lehigh, monroe and smith.}
<C>__{jerome green}
<D>__{and jerome green.}
<A>__{and a waspish lawyer wearing round glasses:}
<C>__{dexter smith}
<D>__{dexter smith.}
<A>__{a white haired lawyer next to belinda:}
<C>__{ralph petersen}
<D>__{ralph petersen.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{you're outnumbered four to one.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{whom do i address? i can't talk to four lawyers at once.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{i'm chief litigator, your honor.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{fine. i've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... there is nothing i hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. if you look at the opinion polls, when mr. john q. citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... where are the lawyers? somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. if we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. and when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. and when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{if it please your honor, we hope to settle this matter.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{by god you will settle it! if you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural born days... now, joseph. what would you require to settle this matter today?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{reinstatement at full salary. back pay covering the period of unemployment and...}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{hold it, joe.}
<P>__{(to wheeler)}
<D>__{he wants to come back to work, chuck.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{that's impossible, your honor.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{that's impossible, joe.}
<C>__{belinda conine}
<D>__{if it please your honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty five thousand dollars.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your generosity overwhelms me, belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{give me a break, joe. let's cut through these false attitudes. give them a figure. how much do you want?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i want to go back to work, your honor.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{you're here at my indulgence, young man. i'm waiting for a figure, joe.}
<A>__{andrew and joe confer with each other.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome... we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{very good, joe. now, belinda, i've got a figure over here, of one million, five. i...}
<A>__{andrew whispers to joe, who interrupts the judge:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{one more thing, your honor...}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(jumping in)}
<D>__{any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.}
<A>__{charles wheeler whispers to belinda conine.}
<C>__{belinda conine}
<D>__{your honor, mr. beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i was the one who was sabotaged.}
<C>__{belinda conine}
<D>__{we have complaints about mr. beckett's lack of preparation, his disorganization, his arrogant, defensive attitude... the list goes on.}
<C>__{jerome green}
<D>__{we have letters.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why haven't you produced these letters?}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<P>__{(to wheeler)}
<D>__{what's the big deal, chuck? the boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone. why are you being hard assed about this?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{i wish i could exonerate you, andy. but i'd have to lie to do it.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(very calm)}
<D>__{you can save it for the jury, charles. i want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, i'm a bad lawyer.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{gentlemen.}
<P>__{(to belinda)}
<D>__{counselor.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{don't do this, andy.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{whoa, whoa...}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{what do you expect them to say, you're alan dershowitz?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{a trial takes time, beckett. do you know what i'm saying?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i think i catch your subtle drift, walter.}
<A>__{andrew saunters out.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{you'll be sorry, beckett.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{andy, you don't want this.}
<A>__{joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. his frown turns into a grin. he faces the judge.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{with all due respect, your honor, my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial.}
<A>__{joe exits.}
