<L>__{interior dr. drayton's office day}
<A>__{claire sits back in the chair. she looks drained. a soft rain taps against the windows.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{and his face...it seemed so gentle, and i knew...in that second i knew that i'd imagined the whole thing.}
<A>__{dr. drayton takes this in. she seems genuinely frightened.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what's happening to me?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{well, that's what we're here for.}
<A>__{he watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes, but...}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{your friend saw them.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{isn't there something called group hysteria?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{you think you influenced her?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{maybe. i don't know. i just know that when all this was happening, i felt, some part of me felt...alive. like somebody needed me. and the more i reached out to, it, the fuller it became.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{you're saying you willed these events to happen?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know, i'm very confused right now.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{did you ever find out what it wanted?}
<A>__{claire remembers.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she said, "you know." that i know.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{guess.}
<A>__{claire ponders this.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i felt...pain. that she'd been hurt by someone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is great. i'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my }
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{have you been hurt?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{me? no. well, in the accident i was injured, but...}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{you were in an accident?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{last year. i drove my car up a tree. nothing serious, this...}
<P>__{(she indicates her scar)}
<D>__{...a minor concussion. but the car looked bad. it could have been bad. i think it scared the hell out of norman.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{how's your marriage?}
<A>__{claire's eyes widen.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{listen, don't hold back.}
<A>__{dr. drayton smiles kindly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{well, he's been amazing throughout this whole thing. patient and caring...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work, and...it's a very important time right now with all that. but, sometimes...i mean with everybody, right? sometimes it's like...}
<A>__{she trails off.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{that he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that i'm...that's something's wrong...with me.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{that can't feel good.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no, it doesn't...okay, look, i see what you're doing here, and that's, i'm sorry, but that's not it. my marriage is fine. i've had some kind of "empty nest" episode where i saw some things that weren't there. let's deal with that. i'm willing to deal with that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.}
<A>__{claire finishes her tirade. dr. drayton lets her settle for a moment.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{fair enough. but you should know that i'm far less concerned with whether things you saw "existed," than i am with why you saw them.}
<A>__{she takes in the ramifications of that.}
