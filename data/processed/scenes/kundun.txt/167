<L>__{interior mao's office night}
<A>__{there is a knock and tenzin gyatso is led into the room. mao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{ah, dalai lama, thank you for coming so late.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i leave tomorrow.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{yes, i am aware. how has your time in china been?}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso sits. he takes out his book and pen, ready to take notes.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. industrial progress. great efficiency. your people are capable and courteous.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{you have a lot to learn about organization. how to draw out people's opinions. how to make key decisions. train your young tibetans. when i make contact with you, i want to reach you through a tibetan.}
<C>__{dalai lama}
<D>__{always.}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso records mao's words.}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{your attitude is good, you know. i understand you well. but you need to learn this: religion is poison. it undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people. tibet has been poisoned by religion.}
<A>__{the boy cannot look up. he is in shock. we see the last words he writes:}
<D>__{"religion is poison."}
<C>__{mao tse tung}
<D>__{well, let me walk you to your car.}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso slowly gets to his feet. we must see on his face that he realizes it has all been lies. all the kind words and promises, it must all be lies. he is unable to raise his face to mao's. all he sees before him are those shinny shoes, those exquisitely shaped, glistening hands.}
