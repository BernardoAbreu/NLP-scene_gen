<A>__{it flies down the street. the board conquers the cracks in the street at an incredible rate. it turns a tight corner, cuts off a turning car, and suddenly stops on a dime. danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left hand side of the street and slowly follows from across the way.}
<L>__{exterior venice blvd. – a crosswalk}
<A>__{derek steps across the sleeping homeless as he walks down the street by himself. danny’s pov. approaching derek from thiry yards away and two animated black men. derek reaches behind him and realizes he’s without a gun. paranoid, derek sticks his hand in his jacket and pretends to be armed. the three men cross paths. the two laughing black men are in suits with briefcases.}
<C>__{black man}
<D>__{what’s going’ on?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{not much.}
<A>__{derek looks back at them as they pass and exhales. he spots danny from across the street, staring and skating from behind. derek stops, sits on a bus stop bench next to an old man, and waits. danny crosses the street and barely avoids a collision with an oncoming caddy.}

<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(teary eyed)}
<D>__{what is it, der. tell me…cause... i want to understand this shit.}
