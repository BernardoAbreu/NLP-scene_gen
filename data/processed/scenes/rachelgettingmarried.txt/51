<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i've made some tea.}
<A>__{abby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into the living room. trailing behind her, kym looks around her mother's unfamiliar house the spaciousness and stark modernity of andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the rampant folksy ness of the buchman house. abby places the tea service on a low table in front of a sprawling sofa in the stone walled living room.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{here darling. sit down. you look upset.}
<A>__{kym sits, pours and sips. abby remains standing and tightens the belt of her bathrobe.}
