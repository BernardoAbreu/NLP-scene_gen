<A>__{full shot interior inn floor (night) it is empty and most of the lights are out. at a considerable distance from camera martha extinguishes the last light, except for a small work light which is servicing bob, who is fingering the piano keys and writing music notes, hard at work. full shot girls' bungalow in the background we see the boys' bungalow. med. shot interior girls' bungalow betty and judy are in twin beds, the light is coming in from the moon. the girls are seen in profile.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(talkative)}
<D>__{the moon! i can't get over the moon up here. the size of it!}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(in a quiet mood)}
<D>__{same one they have all over.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{they'll never prove it to me. and everything smells so beautiful.}
<P>__{(she breathes)}
<D>__{what is it pine or fir?}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(small sniff)}
<D>__{we're near the bakery.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(friendly, not realizing the stab)}
<D>__{you know your trouble, betty? you're not romantic.}
<A>__{betty turns and looks toward her. since judy does not see her, betty's expression is a true reflection of how she feels.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{everything's so wonderful here, so pretty, so exciting, i can't understand how you stay frozen up. let yourself go, go, like me!}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(afraid to ask)}
<D>__{which one is it?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{bob or phil?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{neither.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you mean both.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{it's the same. no one is going to break up our act.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{isn't there one you prefer over the other?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{the way phil dances, and he's funny. it's easy to see yourself married to him.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(an effort)}
<D>__{and bob?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{he's different, deeper, and he's funny, too. it'd be nice to be married to both of them.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{good thing they're not a quartette.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{if i was catherine the great, that's what i'd do. phil in the daytime, bob at night. or should it be the other way around?}
<A>__{close shot judy and betty shooting past betty. is it possible our betty has a suspicion of a tear?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{phil'd be more fun in a night club, but eventually a girl wants a pipe and slipper fellow. that's bob, smoking a pipe and petting a cocker spaniel. still, phil could learn to smoke a pipe. breaking a fellow in to suit you is something every girl should go through. i hear it's half the fun. which one do you like better? betty?}
<P>__{(no answer.)}
<D>__{betty?}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{are you asleep?}
<P>__{(no answer. judy turns}
<D>__{over and closes her}
<P>__{eyes)}
<A>__{music has underscored this scene. betty is wide awake. she is looking toward the window. as the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of bob, sitting on a fence, putting out his pipe. this is followed by an equally diffused figure of betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, and joining bob. bob takes her in his arms. at this point we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter. this causes the diffusion to vanish, and betty gets out of bed and puts on her robe.}
