<L>__{exterior of the tenement again}
<A>__{mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley. he walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large alleyway; this one connecting two streets. the alley is deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction. the man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry. suddenly, mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him. he turns around to see a small, weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray haired black man. limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls. the stranger yells at mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief. mottola just stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice. just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand. the stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where mottola is standing. almost by reflex, mottola picks it up. the thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new found enemy, brandishing a knife. both the stranger and mottola brace themselves for an attack. the thief, realizing that there are two people to fight, begins to think better of it. he is not a young man, nor particularly strong.}
<C>__{thief}
<P>__{(shaking his fist at the stranger)}
<D>__{you fuckin' nigger lover. i will get you for this someday, sucker egg.}
<A>__{mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears. the black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is staggering toward them. he collapses against the alley wall after a few steps. the stranger rushes over to him, followed somewhat absently by mottola.}

<C>__{black man}
<D>__{no, no cops!}
<A>__{mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber band. mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of money.}

<P>__{man, plus the $100 bill)}
<D>__{all right. i will make your drop for you, old man. and don't worry, you can trust me.}
<A>__{mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next to the numbers money. the stranger, who has now finished bandaging, watches him do it.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{if that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.}
<C>__{black man}

<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{how 'bout a handkerchief?}

<A>__{the stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{let me have the money.}

<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(to the black man)}
<D>__{so long, partner. don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{the black man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of worry on his face. mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble. he walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance. suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him. mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking into a dead run. we follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening a big lead on the guy with the knife. he reaches the taxi zone. he hops in a cab and slams the door.}
