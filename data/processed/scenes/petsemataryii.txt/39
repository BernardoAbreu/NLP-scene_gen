<A>__{crude cages house dozens of rabbits. situated alongside the garage. a sign above the cages reads: pet rabbits $10.00. bells positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play. gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage. finishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into feeding slots for the hungry rabbits. setting the feed aside, he takes a seat. opening one of the cages, he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft fur. one of the cages starts to vibrate. gus gives it a look: a pair of rabbits aren't interested in eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion. gus gets a chuckle out of the sight.}
