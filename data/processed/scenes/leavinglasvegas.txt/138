<L>__{interior corridor of hotel night}
<A>__{sera walks along, checking numbers on the doors. she finds the right one and knocks firmly.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{yes? what?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{it's me, yuri.}
<A>__{the door opens a crack and yuri peers out.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{sera! it's...}
<A>__{he looks around for a clock.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{... it's late.}
<L>__{interior yuri's room night}
<A>__{sera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out seven hundred dollars.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{sorry, yuri... good night... lots of tricks... i think things are picking up.}
<A>__{yuri sits on the bed. he looks unwell and disoriented. his face is covered with a thin film of sweat. he seems to be listening for something, because he stops her talking by putting his fingers to his lips. he looks at her and then}
<D>__{beckons her to the bed. sera is nervous. as she walks to the}
<A>__{bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. yuri stops her with a wave of his hand. sera is puzzled and frightened now. yuri seems to be deranged.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{have you told anyone that i'm here?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{yuri suddenly hears something. he grabs sera's hand and takes her to the wall. he presses her head to the wall.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{do you here that?}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{they're talking about me.}
<A>__{he pulls himself together.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{go, sera.}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{go. stay at home. i will call you tomorrow.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{yuri... are you...}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{sera... please go.}
<A>__{he indicates the wall.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{this is very important... and i must listen. now go.}
<A>__{they face each other for a moment and then yuri does an almost comic gesture to tell her to go. he hustles her to the door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her blouse. he slams the door.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(through the door)}
<D>__{goodbye, sera. don't come back here. i will not see you again.}
<A>__{sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she}
<D>__{begins to walk. the camera follows her as she makes her way}
<A>__{down the endless corridor of doors. ahead of her, three men are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they make their way. sera doesn't take them in. they pass and turn a corner. we recognize them as the men from the black town car.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the men have stopped outside yuri's room. the camera pans and we see sera down the other corridor getting into the elevator.}
