<A>__{the chief judge puts on his glasses, stands to read the verdict. yesil, standing with the others, motions billy to rise. billy rises, tense. father looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile. judge continuing, after preliminaries:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the defendant has been found guilty by the court of the illegal possession of hashish...}
<A>__{prosecutor, his expression souring, makes a gesture of defeat. we wanted a conviction for smuggling, not possession. billy, not understanding sees the prosecutor's gesture, and a hint of hope crosses his expression. judge puts the paper away, looks at billy directly.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{...therefore. this court sentences you, vilyum hi yes to be imprisoned at sagamilcar prison for a term of four years and two months. this case is now closed.}
<A>__{billy looking at the judge doesn't understand. thinks he might be free. but suddenly two soldiers move in, and start chaining his hands together. he is bewildered, looking at: yesil hastily conferring with billy's father, more concerned about making a good impression with him than with billy.}

<D>__{four years, two months. it's good.}

<D>__{we appeal it.}
<A>__{billy watching this, a lost look. father is too shocked to do anything but look at yesil who continues on:}
<C>__{yesil}
<D>__{you will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour. remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling...}
