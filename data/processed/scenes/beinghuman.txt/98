<L>__{interior camp night}
<A>__{hector goes inside his little house. he puts his back to the entrance and opens the canvas sack which contains all his possessions. he pulls out his prize, a sizeable chunk of bread and some dried fruit. he guiltily gnaws at the hard bread. he is surprised by the sound of the boy, nuno outside.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{senor hector?}
<A>__{hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the shelter. nuno is holding four fruits, about the size of large apples, but green and thick skinned.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{this was all they found in the forest. four for each of us. they taste kind of milky, but sour.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{thank you, nuno.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{my mother ate three and she was sick. so try two... but she's sick anyway... maybe you can try three...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i will start with two.}
<A>__{nuno makes to leave, but then hesitates.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{hector, will you help me?}
<A>__{nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the raft on the shoreline. the shapes of the two deserters chained there can just be seen.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{lopo... the boy they're going to hang tomorrow... he was cook's cabin boy... i was going to take him something to eat... i thought, perhaps, one of yours and one of mine...}
<A>__{he looks at the fruit he has just given hector.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{you said you might just eat two...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{but there's tomorrow, nuno... we must eat tomorrow too...}
<A>__{nuno looks disappointed. his eyes turn again to his playmate tied to the raft.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{dom paulo would call it a waste. you must keep yourself strong, nuno, that's what he'd say... so that you can help the others... god knows what we have ahead of us... we'll need strong people like you...}
<A>__{nuno is silent, unconvinced.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{try not to think about lopo any more... the guards wouldn't let you near him anyway.}
<A>__{nuno stomps away in silence. hector shouts after him cheerily.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{goodnight!}
