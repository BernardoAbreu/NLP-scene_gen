<A>__{a kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree lined street, tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block. around the corner at the end of the block, the produce truck starts slowly forward. as it turns onto luna's block, a car pulls up behind it and stops, blocking the street. the produce truck parks at the curb in front of the luna house. a neighbor from across the street approaches. the front door of luna's house opens, and tito emerges, helping tony's aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables.}
