<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room day}
<A>__{eliot leans over frank's body on the slab. rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. he gently moves frank's head to one side. in the b.g. anna lies on her slab watching eliot work. anna's pov frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. his face partially reconstructed with plaster of paris.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give frank's face a more natural texture. then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook like barb at each end.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{what's that for?}
<A>__{eliot looks up surprised. anna stands beside him. he leans down. peels back frank's upper lip.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{his mouth. to keep it closed.}
<A>__{eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back frank's lower lip. he attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. he picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{now his eyes.}
<A>__{he inserts the caps into frank's eyes. pulls his eyelids over them. glues the eyelids together.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is this how you'll prepare my body?}
<A>__{eliot looks at her for a moment. smiles reassuringly.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. there's no need. i had to rebuild his face. you're still beautiful.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{does he have family?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{yes. a brother. he's coming in later.}
<A>__{anna touches the white sheet covering frank's body.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{my mother... she didn't cry did she? when she came to see me?}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and paul?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{it's not important anymore.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i need to know.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{no. he didn't cry.}
<A>__{we see a brief flicker of pain in anna's eyes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i knew he wouldn't. he always got upset when i cried. he said crying never helped.}
<A>__{anna suddenly looks very weary. she leans heavily against the slab. as if she's about to fall.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you should rest.}
<A>__{he guides her back to the slab. helps her lie down.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're getting weaker. it's almost time.}
<A>__{eliot strokes her hair tenderly. she looks up at him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{can i ask you something?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why do we die?}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{to make life important.}
<A>__{anna's fingers curl around his hand. like a vulnerable child. totally trusting in him. eliot looks down at anna sadly. we sense he's conflicted. confused. wavering. but then reluctantly he reaches for a syringe filled with amber liquid on the steel trolley. he injects her gently in the neck. watches over her for a moment. then moves to the window. he picks up a window pole. pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.}
