<D>__{i stuffed a hand towel and a big roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, so i could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg... next i fixed the telephone and the doorbell, so that the cards would fall down if the bells rang. that way i would know there had been a phone call or visitor while i was away. i left the apartment house by the fire stairs and side door. nobody saw me. it was already getting dark. i took the vermont avenue bus to los feliz and walked from there up to the dietrichson house. there was that smell of honeysuckle again, only stronger, now that it was evening.}
