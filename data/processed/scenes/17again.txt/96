<A>__{mike tries to squeeze out. the bras block him. the music changes... a remix version of hammer's `can't touch this' blares.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i thought you girls wanted to dance?}
<A>__{mike breaks into the 80's hammer routine we saw from the first scene. the bras back up. party goers stop what they're doing and watch... not sure whether to laugh or join in. and then, the bras fall in. followed by others. the party just got hotter. maggie runs through the party and out the back. stan chases after her. mike inconspicuously hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside.}
