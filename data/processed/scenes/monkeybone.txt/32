<L>__{interior stu's private room morning}
<A>__{as she's done every morning for the last three months, julie brushes stu's teeth. although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around stu on the off chance that he might be aware of her presence. she packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i think we can go another day without shaving. long as you don't look like you're growing one of those stupid little goatees.}
<A>__{she opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{hey, there's an article about the monkeybone show. they've run that one episode about eight times now. herb says it gets higher ratings every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some new material soon...}
<P>__{(long, bored pause)}
<D>__{wanna hear another joke?}
<A>__{she refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback entitled the book of raunch. she pages through it for a moment.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{okay...let me see...here we go. a plane full of explorers crashlands in new guinea; they are captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the chief's hut, where...wait a minute. i know this one...}
<P>__{(reading ahead)}
<D>__{you stinker! you swiped this joke for a monkeybone strip!}
<A>__{she whacks him on the arm with the book. no response at all.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{okay. let's try again. why did the pervert cross the road?}
<A>__{the sound of sobbing interrupts her joke. she looks up and sees kimmy standing in the doorway, red eyed and crying.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{kimmy! what's the matter?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{this is hard for me, julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and...}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i gave the order.}
<A>__{julie just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. then it sinks in. her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.}
