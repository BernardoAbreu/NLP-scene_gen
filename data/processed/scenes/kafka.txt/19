<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the embankment midday kafka and gabriela stroll by the river, kafka finishing off his lunch as they go, occasionally offering tidbits to gabriela who either samples or refuses them.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i was having an affair with eduard.}
<P>__{(notes kafka's reaction)}
<D>__{he didn't tell you?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{he would have. you were his best friend. a better friend than me.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i suspected that he well.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{that he was satisfied in that regard. i didn't want to pry.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(throws her hair back proudly)}
<D>__{it's not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.}
<A>__{kafka lets out a smile at that. gabriela is suspicious of smiles.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{what's funny?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{as long as it's on their terms. if your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator with no recourse whatsoever.}
<A>__{the gnarled, barren branches of a nearby tree shiver over the two of them.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{how long were you and eduard }
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{two or three months, that's all.}
<P>__{(adds)}
<D>__{ i seduced him.}
<B>__{high terrace}
<A>__{a flight of stone steps takes them up here to this vantage spot overlooking the river and the city beyond. kafka stands by a railing and the huge, distorted shadow of someone looms suddenly on the high wall under him.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you know as well as i do that he didn't commit suicide.}
<A>__{kafka looks at her.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no, i don't. i'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{the police would know the difference, wouldn't they?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{do you think people in the new town care what happens over here?}
<P>__{(nodding across the water)}
<D>__{this will always be the ghetto.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{he wasn't robbed. he was identified by his wallet.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{and you believe everything the authorities tell you.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{when i have no reason to doubt.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{the very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. people will do anything to protect their own interests. for all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ what could he have done to warrant that?}
<A>__{for a moment she seems about to tell him, but then looks away. kafka follows her gaze.}
<B>__{in the distance}
<A>__{someone else has paused at the embankment wall further away to stare at the roiling water. he's too far away to see clearly. probably nothing sinister about him at all. still ...}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{turns back to kafka.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{are you free tonight?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{tonight?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{there are some people i'd like you to meet. can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{... all right.}
<A>__{her eyes lock on his for a moment. she's beautiful. he's fearful.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you almost married recently, didn't you?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{last year. i it was broken off.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{eduard wanted to marry me.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{and you ...?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i'm suspicious of men who want to marry. i believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.}
<B>__{the shadow on the wall beneath}
<A>__{disappears, the ominous black mass flowing off the large flat surface as abruptly as it arrived. while up there on the terrace we see gabriela walk away from kafka.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{stays where he is a moment, watching her. he may have found his ideal woman.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(then follows behind her)}
<D>__{ i don't know the musil district.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{you won't have any trouble finding it.}
