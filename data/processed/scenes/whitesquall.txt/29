<A>__{robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the horizon. chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of food.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{how ya doing?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{look, i appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, i can take care of myself.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i just brought you something to eat.}
<A>__{robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods. they stand silently. it's awkward.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i feel like i got you into this.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm used to spending a lot of time alone. i guess that's what i thought it would be out here. but, it's not is it?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i left you hanging up there.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. really. i'm just sorry you got chewed out.}
<A>__{robin nods. they both stare out at the rising moon.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my brother and i used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this. my parents would fight all the time so we'd sneak out there where we couldn't hear 'em and recite scenes from our favorite movies.}
<A>__{robin grows quiet.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{would you believe i miss it? the middle of paradise and i'm homesick.}
<A>__{chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't worry. it'll all be there when we get back.}
