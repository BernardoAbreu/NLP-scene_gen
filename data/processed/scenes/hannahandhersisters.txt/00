<D>__{by woody allen}
<A>__{as the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and the screen fades to total black. immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as a title appears on the screen.}
<D>__{"god, she's beautiful..."}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hannah's apartment night}
<A>__{a full face of lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning against the dining room doorway. she gazes into the camera with a half smile on her face as elliot speaks over the screen.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{god, she's beautiful.}
<A>__{lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away. the camera follows her, moving across a book and photograph filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. people, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her. everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{she's got the prettiest eyes, and she looks so sexy in that sweater.}
<A>__{lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{hi, how are you?}
<A>__{two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now. still walking, lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room. elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her...}
<A>__{lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...and tell her how much i love her and take care of her. stop it, you idiot. she's your wife's sister. but i can't help it.}
<A>__{the camera is still moving with lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother. elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i'm consumed by her. it's been months now. i dream about her. i i, i think about her at the office. oh, lee.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{what am i gonna do?}
<A>__{lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother. she passes several other guests, then turns to greet april, giving her a warm, brief hug.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting. before, when she...}
<A>__{elliot's voice over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man. both are holding drinks as lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. the space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...squeezed past me in the doorway, and i smelled that perfume on the back of her neck...}
<A>__{elliot watches lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk. elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen lee as the other man chatters on.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{...jesus, i, i thought i was gonna swoon! easy...}
<A>__{the camera resumes following a smiling lee. she has just put down the tray and drinks near april, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{you're a dignified financial advisor. it doesn't look good for you to swoon.}
<A>__{the camera stays with elliot, who is still watching the offscreen lee. in the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other. hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted elliot.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)}
<D>__{elliot? elliot?}
<P>__{(rubbing his shoulder)}
<D>__{sweetheart?}
<A>__{elliot returns from his reveries with a start.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(turning to hannah)}
<D>__{mm hm?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(pointing to the tray)}
<D>__{have you tried these? these are wonderful.}
<P>__{(nibbling, swallowing)}
<D>__{holly and her friend made them.}
<A>__{elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(swallowing)}
<D>__{they're fantastic.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(overlapping, still eating)}
<D>__{aren't they great?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{your sister is an unbelievable cook.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(swallowing)}
<D>__{i know! i know!}
<A>__{elliot and hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as holly appears, walking down the hallway. she holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(walking offscreen)}
<D>__{she has all the cooking talent.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(walking offscreen swallowing)}
<D>__{no, she doesn't, either. you've got tons as well.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{ohhh, but i've eaten five of these.}
<A>__{holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping holly)}
<D>__{holly, why don't you open your own restaurant?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(turning to the}
<D>__{offscreen elliot and}
<P>__{hannah, trying to swallow)}
<D>__{mmm, we practically are. well...}
<P>__{(holding her hand to her mouth)}
<D>__{not a restaurant, but...}
<P>__{(swallowing)}
<D>__{april and i are going to do some catering!}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{what? you're kidding!}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{no, no, we decided!}
<A>__{holly takes a sip of her drink as hannah and elliot walk over to her.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{perfect!}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding and swallowing)}
<D>__{mmm...i mean, we love to cook for our friends, so}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{great idea.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(overlapping hannah)}
<D>__{that's where your talent lies.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(swallowing and nodding)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{holly and hannah begin to laugh.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing to elliot, still laughing)}
<D>__{get outta here.}
<P>__{(to hannah)}
<D>__{could i speak to you privately?}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{holly and hannah walk off; elliot watches them leave.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(calling after them}
<D>__{as he nibbles on an}
<P>__{hors d'oeuvre)}
<D>__{i'm her husband! she tells me anything!}
