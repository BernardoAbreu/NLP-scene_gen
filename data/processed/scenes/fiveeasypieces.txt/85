<L>__{exterior dupea house day}
<A>__{bobby stands on the front porch, looking toward... ... catherine coming up from the ocean. she wears a bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a towel, and as she approaches:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i guess you fell in the water.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{yes, intentionally.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's dangerous, you know.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{swimming?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. you could get a cramp.}
<A>__{she laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner of the towel.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i love to swim, and i don't mind the cold at all. it's invigorating.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what would i do with it? run amok?}
<A>__{she comes up the stairs.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{well, there's fishing and boating. there's concerts on the mainland and... but i feel silly telling you. this is really your home. you probably know better than i what there is to do.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{nothing? then it must be very boring for you here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's right. have you anything to suggest?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i don't know. let me give it some thought.}
<A>__{she moves toward the front door, with bobby following.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what're you doing right now...}
