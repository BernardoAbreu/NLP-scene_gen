<C>__{korben}
<D>__{so you do know her.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..}
<A>__{cornelius runs into the next room. korben looks at the girl, goes to slap her, then changes his mind. her beauty troubles him. he hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek. her skin seems so soft, so fragile.}
