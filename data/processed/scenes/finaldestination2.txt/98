<L>__{exterior windy roads day}
<A>__{the pick up truck races to the hospital. as kimberly speeds past a billboard, a police car pulls in hot pursuit.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{shouldn't we pull over?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{no time. keep going. i wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.}
<A>__{at the next intersection, two more cop cars appear.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{oh come on.}
<A>__{the pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which instantly join the high speed chase. kimberly takes a long look in the rearview mirror at the tailgating cops. she then inspects the road ahead.}
<B>__{up in the distance}
<A>__{a busy six lane intersection.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(hesitated beat)}
<D>__{speed up.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{yeah, fuck 'em.}
<P>__{(to thomas)}
<D>__{no offense.}
<A>__{kimberly speeds toward the intersection. she pulls her seatbelt aside, making sure it offers zero protection. thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{be alive, isabella, please be alive.}
<A>__{kimberly's eyes widen in fear. her foot hesitates over the brake pedal as the truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously missing every car! the police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns, avoiding the intersection completely. kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry.}
