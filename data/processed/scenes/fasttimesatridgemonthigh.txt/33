<A>__{the furniture in the hamilton living room looks like it was gleaned for a sale at pic 'n save. through the living room, one can see a very small, kidney shaped pool. stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet near the refrigerator. there are two names on it: brad stacy. brad's side is filled with messages. stacy's is empty. she notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement. stacy reads the attached note. it reads: "memories of you, ron johnson." she quickly gathers it up and carries it back outside. she fans the door several times to dispel the odor.}
