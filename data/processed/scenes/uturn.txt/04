<A>__{the radio blares as bobby fights to stay awake. his attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. he sits up as the police car (sheriff potter inside) closes quickly. the siren starts faintly, then screams as the cruiser roars past at speed.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{there is a loud pop from the front of the mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood. the temperature gauge now starts rising.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no!...not now!...shit!}
<A>__{a couple of semis roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the mustang with their air waves.}
