<L>__{interior alice's cabin day}
<A>__{in the fg is the camp bed with its white coverlet. the snake is nowhere in sight which means it could be anywhere. alice is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her. the room is small. there is the metal frame cot, an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top. the walls are a light blue, freshly painted. the wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side. alice looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees. she pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier. she smiles at herself. she reaches out in cu. open a drawer. takes out a towel. alice turns and goes to her footlocker. bends down and opens it up. takes out a terrycloth robe. she closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.}
