<A>__{mid day another sizzler. temperatures in the nineties. the sun is directly overhead. maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the rock.}
<B>__{a steady stream of sand pours from the crack... a slight tremor... then the frightening sound of rock moving against rock...}
<A>__{maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... hands scraping at the dirt... he slides off the rock... feet and hands desperately trying to cling to the hillside... he picks up speed as he tumbles down... maurice looks down in time to see a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for panic... slam! a sickening crack of bone as maurice hits the rock square in the ribs... maurice flops down the rest of the slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt, clutching his ribs. the sun beats down on his stunned eyes. maurice stares up at the dizzying slope. sand still trickling down to a stop. he doesn't try to move for the first few seconds. his breathing increasingly erratic. maurice drags himself to sit upright. the sharp pains causing a distorted grimace on his face. a short rest, before working his way to his feet.}
