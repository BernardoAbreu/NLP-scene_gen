<L>__{interior elijah's lab}
<A>__{julieernie, the worm, and rick are just emerging from the hole. it's really dark in the lab.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{shit. i can't see a damn thing.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{keep your voice down, ernie.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{don't push me, coog. i got a real short fuse today. i'm cranky, bloated, got a wicked case of cramps. don't ask why.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(whispers to rick)}
<D>__{pms...}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(has to think about this)}
<D>__{oh.... right.}
<A>__{rick pats ernie on the shoulder reassuringly. he moves over to elijah's computer terminal.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{well, here it is the control panel for elijah's freaking process.}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{good work, my boy. now step aside. this is scientist's work.}
<A>__{worm muscles rick out of the way and sits at the console. using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches and punches a fast series of computer keys. the light on top of the tasty freekz machine starts to revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of gooey light brown glop oozes out of the spigot.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{hey! it's working!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you did it, worm! way to go!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{but how? you didn't even use the noxon.}
<A>__{the worm rushes over to the container of glop below the spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it! rick, julie, and ernie gasp in horror! the worm lifts his glop smeared face out of the bowl, and smacks his lips in delight.}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{ah! you don't need noxon to make butterscotch pudding. i just wanted to test the machine's capabilities. mmmm! glorious! so creamy! yum!}
<A>__{the worm is lost in his pudding induced reverie. they ignore him. julie turns to rick.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{hang on, rick. do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you? what if it doesn't work? what if something goes wrong? what if }
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{if it does work, do you think there'll be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney?}
<A>__{julie goes to doink ernie in the eyes, but he uses the classic "three stooges" handblock.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{here, hold this.}
<A>__{rick hands the container of noxon to ernie. julie gives him the eyepoke. rick shakes hands with julie, and takes back the noxon.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(to julie, heroically)}
<D>__{look, i've been a freak all my life.' i realize that now. up there on that screen, humiliating myself for every fool with six bucks in his pocket }
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{seven bucks.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{sometimes seven fifty.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{alright. it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{sure it does. they don't let you into the theater if you don't pay the price of the ticket.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look, i'm talking about the ultimate human sacrifice.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no kidding. when you consider money for parking, popcorn, drinks...}
<A>__{the worm chimes in, still gorging himself on pudding...}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{don't forget a sitter for the children!}
<A>__{rick's had enough.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hey! in case you haven't noticed, i'm about to commit a noble and selfless act here.}
<A>__{rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying. it smashes through the window, setting off a loud siren.}
