<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{it's amazing, us running into each other like this. maybe it's fate.}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{maybe not. i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. when it turned out it was you, i made sure we'd run into each other...}

<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{or...?}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{they revoke our flight status.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{oh, i see... teamwork.}
<A>__{carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. zander's impressed.}
<C>__{deladier}

<C>__{zander}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. star drive in three... two... one...}
