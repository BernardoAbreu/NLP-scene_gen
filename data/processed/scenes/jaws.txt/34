<L>__{interior boat shed night}
<A>__{dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. at one end, the large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a tarp. a single dark figure is bending over the dead shark. the large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, and the shadowy figure moves abruptly away from the shark. the new entrants move into the shed. it is hooper and brody and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on the way over. as the shadowy figure moves silently into a vantage point against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; it is quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize him as he backs against the wall.}

<D>__{...and it was dartmouth winter weekend, and she was homecoming queen, and i was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right her great grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders. so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what stinks so bad?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{our friend, the shark.}
<A>__{they bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{we always had a summer place on the water newport, the vineyard, so i figured i'd major in something i knew about. oceanography, marine biology. it was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. hmmm. he we go. up the old alimentary canal. hold the light.}
<A>__{we hear a slurp and a squish as hooper produces a big knife and dips into the shark with a major incision.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{we open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. simple.}
<P>__{(he attends to his work)}
<A>__{from his vantage point, quint watches, unseen by the two men. brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, fascinated by the bizarre ritual.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{half a flounder. hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what? what?!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{just as i thought. he drifted up here with the gulf stream, from southern waters.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(showing it)}
<D>__{florida license plate.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he ate a car?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{no, but tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. they eat anything. but this one didn't eat any people. there's nothing here...}
<A>__{he kicks the remains around below camera.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{...nothing.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{if you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. you go out and chum for him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{chum?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{only one sure way to find him offer him a little something to eat. chum blood, waste meat, fish, anything. they can sense it miles away. if he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{it's a good time, too. they're night feeders...}
