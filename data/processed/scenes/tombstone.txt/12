<L>__{ext o.k. corral allen st. day}
<A>__{a large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot. wyatt's big horses feed in their stalls while wyatt faces the stableboy:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{...and easy on the grain, i don't want 'em too fidgety.}
<A>__{morgan and virgil enter with fred white, the jovial old town marshal. shaking hands, all 4 go up allen, taking in the town.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{wyatt, meet fred white, he's town marshal.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{lotta law around here. just met the sheriff.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{who, behan? he ain't no law, only real law here's the cowboys.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{the cowboys, yeah. i heard of 'em.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{nobody does nothin' without 'em. they're it. hell, even the apache're scared of 'em. there's a couple right there: sherman mcmasters and pony deal. can always spot a cowboy, they all wear those red sashes.}
<A>__{white points to sherman mcmasters and pony deal, a half breed, standing over by the hotel, joking in sign language.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{look pretty rough.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{just like any other hard cases. gotta know how to handle 'em.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{well i'm no wild bill. way i handle 'em's just mainly live and let live. that usually answers but even so, gets kinda spooky sometimes. still somebody's gotta do it, i mean how the hell else you gonna walk down the street?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{doesn't anybody raise a stink? the hell kinda town is this?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{boomtown. wide open. people grabbin' with both hands ain't got time for any law and order. in fact the less law the more opportunities there are for makin' money. plain fact is the cowboys're good for business.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{what about all these saloons?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{ah, now that's the real mother lode in tombstone. up and down allen street, full blast 24 hours a day, liquor, hostesses, gamblin', makin' money hand over fist. all except the oriental. on account of the element. have a man for breakfast in there most days. regular slaughter house. high rollers won't go near it. too bad, nice place.}
<A>__{wyatt nods, suddenly very interested as they walk on and....}
