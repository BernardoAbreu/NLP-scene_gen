<L>__{exterior bus stop. day}
<D>__{the rain has begun. jenny attempts to cover herself. a mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and a beautiful, sleek red sports car a bristol stops to let them across. david, possibly in his mid thirties, dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the car. david, distracted, impatient, spots jenny at the bus stop. in front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the foot of one of the children,further slowing down their painfully slow progress across the road. jenny is wet. david makes eye contact. jenny smiles ruefully, and enchantingly. david sighs, and then hesitates for a moment. the window of the bristol slowly rolls down.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello. jenny ignores him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{listen. if you've got any sense, you wouldn't take a lift from a strange man. jenny smiles thinly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i am, however, a music lover, and i'm worried about your cello. so what i propose is, you put it in the car and walk alongside me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how do i know you won't just drive off with the cello?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah. good pointerior he winds down the other window and waves on the cars that have stopped behind him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how much does a new cello cost? twenty pounds? thirty? i don't know. let's say thirty. he pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten pound notes, hands them to her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there. security. jenny laughs and waves the money away.}
