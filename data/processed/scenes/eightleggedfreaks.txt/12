<L>__{exterior road joshua's house day}
<A>__{two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of nowhere.}
<L>__{interior joshua's house day}
<A>__{the decor is an odd mix of vietnam era war relics and homegrown scientist. charlie the parrot sits on a perch.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{charlie, don't surf!}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{quiet, bird. we're working.}
<A>__{mike and joshua stand near the spider tanks. a dozen aquariums on low shelves. each glass tank replicates a specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.}
<C>__{joshua}
<P>__{(dims tank lights)}
<D>__{the sun is going down, my nocturnal hunters. it's time to come out and feed.}
<A>__{mike watches joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah. they're definitely getting bigger.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{i've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty eight hours. but that seems to be accelerating.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{all from eating these bugs? maybe i should try some.}
<A>__{mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food. a trap door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack in the box. the arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond. mike looks in another tank where ogre eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{run, little guys.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{they can't outrun the food chain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i could get away.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{imagine yourself the size of that fly. a scytodes spitter would be as big as a cadillac. you'd be spider chow, kid.}
<A>__{mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets. he moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{are the new tarantulas in here?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{took me forever to get a breeding set of chilean reds. i must have bribed every customs agent from vegas to santiago.}
<A>__{joshua unveils the tank. dirt floor. several burrow entrances. joshua pours in the bugs. a large, male tarantula comes out of a burrow. it pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy like bundle.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that is too cool.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{male tarantulas compete for the female's attention.}
<C>__{joshua }
<D>__{each one tries to bring her the best present. bugs, rats, even the occasional parrot.}
<B>__{charlie squawks.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{the prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest. you know how women love breakfast in bed.}
<A>__{joshua leads mike to the back of the tank. a network of subterranean tunnels is revealed. the male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male.}
<A>__{mike peers into a large den. the female tarantula steps out of the shadows. this is consuela, the chilean red tarantula.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{say hello to consuela.}
<A>__{mike watches consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles. she begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{she fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. now watch... she'll drink her victim from the inside out. while it's still alive!}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(looks queasy)}
<D>__{and you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. and they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried.}
<A>__{suddenly consuela lunges at the glass. mike recoils.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{bad! bad consuela!}
<A>__{consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated. tarantula pov mike the multi eyed spider's panoramic vision. mike looms large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.}
<B>__{back to mike}
<A>__{mike stares into the many eyes of consuela.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{do that again and i feed you to the parrot.}
<A>__{charlie squawks hungrily. the sound of a car horn.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{there's your mom.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{see you tomorrow, joshua!}
<A>__{mike heads for the door.}
