<D>__{to tim the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. that right there is p t. prime time.}

<C>__{karaoke dj}
<D>__{tim lip? you in the house?}
<A>__{joan passes tim the shot. he slams it. the room applauds as tim nervously makes his way to the stage. tim confers with the dj. the dj nods, cues up the song. tim gives joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i, um, i've met some really, just super neat people here. but this song, i'd like to dedicate to the first african american person i've ever met. i mean, i've seen guys at the oneida mall in rhinelander said hello and that. but... anyway, i just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. ronald wilkes!}

<D>__{i was born and raised down in alabama. on a farm way back up in the woods. i was so ragged that folks used to call me patches. papa used to tease me about it. but deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.}

<C>__{tim }
<P>__{(breaks into song, very soulful)}
<D>__{my papa was a great old man. i can see him with a shovel in his hands. see education he never had; he did wonders when the times got bad. the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.}
