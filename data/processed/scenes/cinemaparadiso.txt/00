<A>__{shooting script salvatore's mother's house. giancaldo ext interior day the october sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the city of giancaldo have been built up. bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white walls in an almost blinding reflection. maria, a woman a little over sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{...salvatore, that's right, salvatore. di vita salvatore ...but, miss, what do you mean you don't know him?!...i...yes...}
<P>__{(she gives a nervous sigh.}
<D>__{she has dialed her way through endless numbers but still hasn't managed to speak to mr. di vita. she finally heaves a}
<P>__{sigh of relief.)}
<D>__{...that's right, good for you! oh!...yes...and i'm his mother. i'm calling from sicily. been trying all day...ah, he's not there...but would you be so kind as to give me...?...yes...}
<P>__{(she nods at another woman}
<D>__{around forty sitting nearby: it is lia, her daughter, who jots down the numbers her}
<P>__{mother dictates:)}
<D>__{...six, five, six, two, two, oh, six...thanks ever so much...goodbye. goodbye.}
<A>__{she hangs up, takes the number lia has jotted down, determined to have still another try. lia speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.}
<C>__{lia}
<D>__{look, ma...it's useless calling him. he'll be terribly busy, god knows where he is. besides he might not even remember. do as i say, forget it...he hasn't been here for thirty years. you know how he is.}
<A>__{maria pauses to think it over. the decision she has to make is important. then, stubbornly.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{he'll remember! he'll remember!}
<P>__{(she puts on her glasses}
<D>__{and starts dialing}
<P>__{the number.)}
<D>__{...i'm positive. i know him better than you do. if he were to find out we hadn't told him, he'd be angry. i know.}
<P>__{(she takes off her glasses.)}
<D>__{...hello? good morning. could i please speak to mr. salvatore di vita. i'm his mother...}
<A>__{streets. rome ext interior night it's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown. inside a high powered car, a man around fifty is driving. it is salvatore dl vita. elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face creased by deep wrinkles. his weary expression hides the determined, sell assured manner of the successful self made man. he must be a heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his cigarette. he stops at a red light. he stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the window, as a little fiat uno pulls up alongside. a rock tune plays full blast on the radio. salvatore turns instinctively to have a look at the man at the wheel a boy with a brush cut standing straight in the latest fashion. he studies the boy's expression with almost exaggerated attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. the girl sitting beside him, lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns salvatore'5 look, provocatively. the boy notices, turns to salvatore in a surly voice:}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{hey! what the fuck you looking at!?}
<A>__{green light. the fiat uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.}
<C>__{salvatore s apartment. rome interior night}
<A>__{the apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. there is no one waiting for salvatore. through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen slumbering in the night. salvatore gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. he moves quietly, as if to make no noise. he doesn't even turn on the light, finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. a rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{salvatore...but what time is it?}
<A>__{she turns on the bedside light. it is clara, a young woman around thirty. salvatore climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a whisper.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{it's late, clara. sorry, but i wasn't able to let you know i wouldn't be corning...}
<P>__{(he fondles her, but he is}
<D>__{tired, feels like}
<P>__{sleeping.)}
<D>__{go to sleep now. sleep.}
<A>__{he turns over on the other side. clara shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, but whispers.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{your mother phoned. she took me for somebody else...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{and what'd you tell her?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i played dumb, so as not to disappoint her. we had a nice little talk. she says you never go see her, and when she wants to see you she has to come to rome...is it true?}
<A>__{salvatore doesn't answer. god only knows how often he's heard that question before.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{she phoned just to say that?}
<A>__{she reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{she said a certain alfredo had died. and the funeral's taking place tomorrow afternoon...}
<P>__{(a strange look suddenly}
<D>__{comes into salvatore's eyes. the idea of going to sleep has clearly left him. it's a piece of news he didn't expect. that's taken him off guard. clara would like to carry on the conversation, but sleepiness makes it almost impossible. an she can manage is one last question in a faint little}
<P>__{voice:)}
<D>__{who is it? a relative of yours?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{no. sleep. go to sleep.}
<A>__{she falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. salvatore is seized by a sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. he gazes through the window al the city, with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a heavy curtain of rain. but he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re emerges, comes back to life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle aged features of his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is formed, an ancient, remote image...}
<C>__{church and sacristy. giancaldo interior morning}
<A>__{an image from over forty years before. in the baroque church of giancaldo. salvatore is nine years old. dressed as an altar boy, he is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. the congregation is also kneeling. the priest is consecrating the host. little salvatore has just got out of bed, is still half asleep, yawns and doesn't notice that the priest is standing there with the host in the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{pss! pssst!}
<A>__{salvatore finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the withering look of the priest. he gets the message at once and rings the bell. now the priest can carry on, lifts the chalice and the bell is heard again.}
<D>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the service is over. the priest is in the sacristy removing his vestments. and salvatore is also there, removing his altar boy tunic.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{but how can i make you understand? without the bell i just can't go on! always half asleep, you are! what do you do at night anyway? eat instead of sleep?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{father, at my house we don't even eat at noon. that's why i'm always sleepy. that's what the vet says.}
<A>__{the priest has finished disrobing. he takes the bell salvatore was holding during the service and turns to leave.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{all right, toto, get moving, i've got things to do. say hello to your mother.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{can i...}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{and don't ask if you can come... because you can't!! shoo, shoo, off with you!!}
<A>__{salvatore gives a shrug and leaves. the priest goes down a corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door leading to an outside courtyard. he cuts across it and disappears into another door.}
<C>__{interior cinema paradiso and projection booth morning}
<A>__{the priest enters a movie house. not very big 200 seats on the main floor and another seventy in the balcony. along the walls, posters of films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. in one corner, a statue of the virgin mary with flowers. the cleaning lady has finished work and is leaving. up in the balcony, over the last row of seats, are the holes of the projection booth. the middle hole is camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth. there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be made out, appearing and disappearing...it is alfredo, the projectionist. he is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough peasant face. he has finished loading the projector and is checking the carbons in the arc lamp. then he removes the glass from one of the holes and looks down into the theatre, at the priest who waves his hand.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{ok, alfredo, you can start!!}
<A>__{he sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre. up in the booth, alfredo lights the arc lamp and sets the projector going. down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. string music, sweet and ominous, spreads through the theatre. on the screen appear the credit titles of an american film of the 1940s. the priest screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on the arm of his seat. at the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves, opens a crack and salvatore's gaunt little face appears. he has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen. the credit titles have long come and gone. the story is at a turning pointerior up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion, alfredo watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the priest, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. on the screen, the male and female lead, two hollywood stars, are in close up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. salvatore, carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. the love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love struck couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. instinctively, the priest raises the bell into the air, as in some age old ceremony, and gives it a loud ring... up in the booth alfredo hears the bell; it's the signal he's been waiting for. he takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that specific scene as it winds on to the reel. the projection continues... ...and also the kiss of the two actors. the priest's nervous look lingers on those black and white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last declaration of love before separating. salvatore is wide eyed, he's probably never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. the screen is now filled with the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. salvatore stares in open mouthed wonder. the priest, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. from the sound of the bell to another sound...}
<C>__{main square. giancaldo exterior day}
<A>__{the tolling of the bell tower rings out over the square. it is noon. the vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. a noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. people come and go in front of the town hall. the working men's club is deserted. the entrance of the cinema paradiso is shut. hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been seen on screen. up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. the hum of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'the end'. then dead silence. the showing is over.}
