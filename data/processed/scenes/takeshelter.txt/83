<A>__{hannah watches television in the den by herself. in the bedroom, samantha sits on the edge of the bed. curtis stands a few paces back. his hands dug into the back of his dusty jeans.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{not a word. you didn't say one word about this to me. don't you think you owe me that? don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what i had to say?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i didn't want you worryin' about it.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{well i'm worried curtis. how are you paying for all that?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i got a home improvement loan from the bank.}
<A>__{samantha is stunned. she stands and gets in his face.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{how could you do that without talking to me? you know the expenses we have comin' up. you want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i'm doin' it...i'm doin' it for us. i know you don't understand.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you're right. i don't understand. i don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. i don't understand you puttin' red out back. i don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. you don't come to bed half the time. you leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. explain that to me. please. tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this.}
<A>__{curtis can't look at her. he tries to find words but fails.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{there's nothin' to explain.}
<A>__{samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer. she's on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i'm gonna go put hannah to bed.}
<A>__{curtis walks out of the room. samantha can't hold back, tears run down her face.}
