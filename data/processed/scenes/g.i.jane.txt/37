<A>__{a photographer stands near a car parked just outside the base. he's peering through a 600mm lens. photographer's pov: focusing through cyclone fencing... panning past the sand dunes... and finding green clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course.}
<L>__{exterior obstacle course coronado naval base day}
<A>__{an explosion of sand: england and wickwire belly flop into a sand pit and speed crawl under barbed wire. clear, they gain their feet and blitz toward... the rolling logs. they balance beam their way to... the rope climb. racing to the top, they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto... the high poles. they land awkwardly, losing their wind and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before... racing for the finish. the chief thumbs a stopwatch.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{england, 88 seconds. you're good to go for the slide for life. wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90.}
<C>__{wickwire}
<D>__{fuck. yes sir.}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{who'd you kiss to get back in here, anyway?}
<A>__{wickwire dusts off and starts back for... the starting line. stepping up next is cortez, the human fighting cock. jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle and eight foot sheer wall.}
<C>__{instructor johns}
<D>__{hang on, here...}
<A>__{he grabs something off a truck and positions it at the base of the wall. it's a little two step platform. snickers, moans from the guys. cortez can barely contain his disgust.}
<C>__{cortez}
<D>__{aw, what is this...}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(mortified)}
<D>__{sir...}
<C>__{instructor johns}
<D>__{don't have to use it, o'neil, but it's gotta go out.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{five... four... three...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i can make this wall without }
<C>__{instructor johns}
<D>__{... two... one... mark!}
<A>__{cortez blurs away. jordan starts a step late. cortez takes the wall clean. eschewing the two step, jordan jumps right over it but jumps too far out because of it. she takes the wall awkwardly.}
