<L>__{interior hotel}
<A>__{as jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard stand up, prominently displayed in the lobby. it is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation at the bottom: "with guest vocalist." on the other side of the lobby, frank is pacing nervously.}

<D>__{i will hit you, frank. i swear.}
<A>__{frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at jack's hair. jack hits him.}

<D>__{she's here.}
<A>__{susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, look at her. you'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.}
<P>__{(walking over)}
