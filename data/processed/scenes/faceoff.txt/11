<L>__{interior humvee day}
<A>__{archer slams the vehicle into gear.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{you're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{tito obeys as archer peels out. the hummer roars at the jet. the jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft. the humvee is aimed right at it... archer's eyes narrow.}
<B>__{collision course}
<A>__{as two hunks of metal bear down. the machines are seconds apart when archer looks up to see... winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, castor holding a gun to her head. archer cuts the wheel just avoiding the jet. the hummer skids to a stop as federal back up arrives but too late. archer watches an fbi chopper landing in a swirl of dust. as the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens. castor blasts winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{castor smiles at pollux, sensing freedom, until... ka chunk: something pounds the jet from above. castor leans out the hatch and sees... the chopper on top of them archer at the controls. eye contact years of hatred pass between these men. castor blasts at him from the open hatch. the chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs. archer jerks and weaves dodging the bullets. the chopper pulls away. the jet finally lifts off... when... the chopper settles on the jet slamming at its tail.}
<B>__{tarmac}
<A>__{tito reacts to this madness as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap frog with the jet. the end of the runway is coming up fast. archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.}
<B>__{jet pilot}
<A>__{can't budge the jet's jammed yoke. thwarted, he powers back the throttle. thrust reverse.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{the horizontal elevator's smashed! we can't lift off!}
<B>__{castor}
<A>__{shoots the pilot then takes the controls. he struggles to maneuver the jet. suddenly... a biplane descends right at them about to land.}
<B>__{archer}
<A>__{pulls up just as the jet swerves radically to avoid the biplane and slams into the hangar.}
<B>__{jet}
<A>__{plows through the glass door, the nose wheel snaps off. the plane skids right into the hangar finally stopping at the wings.}
<B>__{fbi chopper}
<A>__{lands. archer steps out calmly like a cop about to write a traffic ticket. he hurries to join more fbi agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.}
