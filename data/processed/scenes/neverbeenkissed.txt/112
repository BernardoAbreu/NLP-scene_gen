<D>__{are you scared?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm gonna tell you something here, and i hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. i'm a little afraid of heights.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you're afraid of the ferris wheel.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{oh right. the spiderman incident.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{you remember that story?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{of course. i remember everything from your class.}
<A>__{they smile at each other. the smile is interrupted by a heavy swaying of their bucket, caused by tommy rocking in the bucket ahead. sam looks a little green.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yoooooow.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{don't look down!}
<A>__{they're facing the ground at this pointerior}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay this is okay. smooth.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{can i ask you something? do you think i tell too many stories in class?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{that's what makes you interesting.}
<P>__{(beat, recovering)}
<D>__{as a teacher.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{god, i would love to think i'm an interesting teacher. i mean, i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{you do. seem to. have passion. in the classroom.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you have to say that. you're my student.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{i don't have to say that.}
<A>__{they look into each other's eyes just as tommy rattles his bucket ruthlessly.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{if the bucket's a rockin', don't come a knockin'.}
<A>__{josie and sam laugh uncomfortably.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{boys.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. some of us will always be rattling cages.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{why do you do that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know. and you know what's scary when you get older it just gets more confusing. i've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know what, i shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{that's okay. it's nice to have someone to talk to }
<A>__{the bucket is rocked again by tommy sam grips the safety bar.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(as he rocks)}
<D>__{same here.}
<A>__{they stop rocking but they're still stuck at the top.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all i can tell you is that when you're my age, the guys will be lined up around the block for you.}
<A>__{they share a smile.}
<C>__{josie}
<P>__{(suddenly shy)}
<D>__{you have to say that. you're my teacher.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i shouldn't say that, because i'm your teacher.}
<A>__{they look at each other, their smiles fading into realization. suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to move down. josie and sam are pulled out of their reverie. they smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh. wide shot of the ferris wheel as josie and sam descend.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{thanks, josie. this wasn't as bad as i thought.}
<C>__{josie }
<D>__{when are you going to open your eyes?}
