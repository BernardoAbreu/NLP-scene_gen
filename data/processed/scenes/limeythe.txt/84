<L>__{exterior valentine's house. afternoon.}
<A>__{avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where all the action is. party guests milling outside, waiting for their cars so they can leave. a fire truck, a police car. smoke pouring out of valentine's garage. valentine finishes talking to a couple of cops. walks over to avery.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{you should have let me do the talking.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{why, because you're my security consultant?}
<P>__{(insecure)}
<D>__{this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.}
<C>__{avery}
<P>__{(more concerned about police presence)}
<D>__{what did you tell them.}
<A>__{valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i told them a long time employee flipped out. had a drug problem, refused counselling. set the garage on fire, then committed suicide. one of my "guests" tried to stop him but how do you stop gordon .}
<A>__{in this context meaning how did that rangy englishman do it.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i mean, gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{heavier than that now. but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{as it happens. i didn't make that part up.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{and where is this guest? don't they want to interview him.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{i don't know everyone here. he was so traumatized he split.}
<P>__{(another notion)}
<D>__{maybe he was gordon's pusher .}
<A>__{avery stares at valentine. impressed at him thinking on his feet.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{where do you think he is, mike.}
<C>__{avery}
<P>__{(already turning)}
<D>__{we'll find him.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(stops him)}
<D>__{no. i mean. not even your people should be involved. right? it's too close now.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{you think i'm staying?}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{there's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{well, can we make it one more. nowhere the fuck near me.}
<A>__{he's being glib, but he's being serious. his open handed gesture inquiring of avery: are you up to the task?}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i have other resources.}
<A>__{he turns to go.}
