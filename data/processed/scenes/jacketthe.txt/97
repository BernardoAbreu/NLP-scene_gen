<L>__{interior main room, ward, alpine grove, day, 1992}
<A>__{the state rep 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy is recognizable among a group that includes the chief of staff (dr. williams), becker, lorenson and gries. they are presiding over a group therapy session when starks enters...}
<D>__{starks [calling out] sorry i'm late, dr. becker.}
<A>__{becker is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{mr. starks, this session is for our civil patients. damon, please take mr. starks back to his ward.}
<A>__{starks cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.}
<D>__{starks [derisively] no. please, dr. becker. you can strap me in a jacket or even gag me, but please don't leave me out of therapy. this is where i feel like i make the most progress.}
<A>__{becker relents, seeing starks has the upper hand an audience, deranged but eager no less.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{fine, mr. starks. you can pull up a chair for yourself.}
<A>__{as starks walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone as they turn their heads to watch him that he is a physically ailing man. using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the group, dragging a chair behind him because he doesn't have the strength to lift it. starks sits down.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{mr. jensen, please continue.}
<A>__{jensen a twitchy schizophrenic surveys the group seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's about to...}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{well, [beat] i've been approached by the federal trade organization.}
<A>__{becker's not listening to a word jensen says. but starks is.}
<D>__{becker [calm as ever] and what have they approached you about, mr. jensen?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{they want me to head the organization for the organized.}
<A>__{the other patients look at him in wonder as the state rep listens limply.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{the organization...for the organized?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{that's right. have you heard of them?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{no, mr. jensen. i have not.}
<C>__{group patient 2}
<D>__{that's because there is no such organization, you idiot.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{that is categorically not true. bl bl blatantly and manifestly not true. i've been asked to lead them. but, if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush hush, would they? becker [wearily] what do the rest of you think?}
<A>__{the group stares at one another silently.}
<D>__{starks [loud and emphatic] well, [beat] i know they exist.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{and how is that?}
<A>__{starks looks at jensen, who looks back avidly. mackenzie eyes starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{when i was in the gulf, the organization was recruiting the organized. becker [incensed] is that a fact, mr. starks? because if it's not, it doesn't help mr. jensen. starks [looking right at jensen] it is a fact. bona fide, and classified.}
<A>__{lorenson and mackenzie watch starks curiously.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{i knew it! i knew it! those little fuckers are everywhere.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{they recruit only the best, mr. jensen. [beat] i didn't want to have to say this...}
<A>__{not even the doctors dare disrupt the silence...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{but these people [pointing to the doctors] know about it. in fact, when presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to alpine grove. they're among us right now! [looking right at becker] isn't that right, dr. thatcher? and jensen, i'm proud they picked you.}
<A>__{jensen looks on nobly.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{they're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm?}
<A>__{starks suddenly turns right at becker, wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[looking suddenly directly at becker] all they do is give orders. that's all they have to do. and no one will ever know. all it comes down to is an order. [beat] they've got hands everywhere.}
<A>__{starks stands up, ready to salute mr. jensen. the observers look to becker for order.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{long live the organization for the organized!}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{sit down, mr. starks! sit down, mr. starks!}
<A>__{but, at that, jensen's completely lost it. his excitement erupts in the form of him jumping out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly hitting himself in the head.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{sit down, mr. jensen!}
<A>__{too late. other patients are on their feet, hands jubilantly up in the air. and, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless order is soundly delivered in becker's nod to damon.}
<C>__{random patients}
<D>__{dr. thatcher! dr. becker!}
<A>__{damon and harding grab starks while the other members of the staff slowly calm the other patients. lorenson is too busy to notice them taking starks out. starks winks at mackenzie, who smiles somewhat sadly back.}
