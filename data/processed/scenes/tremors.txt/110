<L>__{exterior nestor's house roof day}
<A>__{straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof. nestor grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly! the roof warps, spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the ground. this causes a flurry of activity. tentacles snake around where the tiles fell. we hear creatures crash through inside, snorting and huffing. they attack the house in earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out till it falls flat. the roof collapses on that side! nestor can't hang on! he slides all the way down, landing across a window on the flattened wall. the next instant he's grabbed and pulled through the window, right into the ground. he screams! dolly along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where melvin is. all we can see is dirt, but we can still hear nestor screaming underground! his screams get more and more faint as dolly ends on:}
