<L>__{exterior house same}
<A>__{pauline marches toward malcolm. malcolm wears the safety goggles and revs the chainsaw.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{are you able to do this yourself?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pauline, do you want me to cut it down or not?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{watch the tent.}
<A>__{the jagged blades pierce the trunk. pauline crunches her face. malcolm stops suddenly. he walks around the tree and inspects the bark.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(indicating his fleece)}
<D>__{i liked how it looked on vogler.}
<A>__{pauline starts to say something stops. then:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i think it's over between dick and margot. he was so cruel to her today. and poor claude had to watch it all. she should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. it's cowardly. and dick koosman. what a choice. i mean...you know?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i agree. i hate the idea of dick fucking margot.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what does that mean? you want to fuck margot?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pauline, that's not what i said.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.}
<A>__{malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again. they yell over the noise:}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i said i thought she was attractive after you grilled me. she has no interest in me anyway. not that it would matter if she did.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{have you ever done anything like that.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{have you ever cheated on me?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{malcolm shuts the motor.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{can i do this?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{those emails you had with that student of mine.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(exhales)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did that...i know you said it was nothing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it was.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i just... can you say it again?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i just did. now, can i cut down the tree?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you never did anything with her?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no. she emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and... you know we were friends.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{right, just a regular friendship between you and a twenty year old girl.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pauline, how many times do i have to say it.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but...why don't i believe it?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{because margot can't understand why you're with me and now when she's around you look for things.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{you promise.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{pauline looks at him long and hard. malcolm takes off his goggles.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{okay. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{malcolm and pauline continue to stare at one another. he guns the chainsaw. tears spill suddenly from his eyes. pauline startles. he flicks the switch off.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm going to tell you something.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(suddenly terrified)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't want to lose you, though. okay?}
<A>__{pauline's face goes pale.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm going to tell you... just let me... maisy...}
<A>__{pauline teeters.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{...we didn't really do anything. we were goofing around, i was making fun of her cause she dates a jock...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i shouldn't've put myself in that position, i know that. we brushed lips really. it was barely a kiss. and then we stopped. that was it.}
<A>__{his nose runs. he wipes it messily with his arm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{our tongues touched. i don't want to under sell it either. i mean... we made out. i made out with her. i don't know why. i don't even like her. it's been a heady time.}
<P>__{(pauline says nothing)}
<D>__{what are you thinking? please, tell me what you're thinking.}
<A>__{pauline rushes at the tree she smacks her hands on the trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. it doesn't budge. in frustration and rage, she runs.}
