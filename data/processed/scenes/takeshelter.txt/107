<A>__{samantha closes the door. in the kitchen, samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down from the fridge. she removes the envelope with the word "beach" written on it and takes out a stack of bills. she folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse before placing the empty envelope back in the tin. she looks out back and sees curtis sitting with hannah. outside, the shipping container has been covered over with dirt. two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with hannah. he signs something that makes her laugh. hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands. curtis touches her nose, leaving a dirt smudge. hannah laughs. she touches his face, smudging it. in the kitchen, samantha watches through the back door.}
