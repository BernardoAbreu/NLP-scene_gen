<L>__{interior jeff's apartment night medium shot}
<A>__{lisa turns away from jeff's chair to get a cigarette from the table. she lights it, as jeff turns his chair back to the room.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{as much as i hate to give thomas j. doyle too much credit, he might have gotten a hold of something when he said this was pretty private stuff going on out there.}
<A>__{he indicates the outside neighborhood with a movement of his head. she doesn't answer, but studies the photographs on the wall of his room.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long focus lens until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm not much on rear window ethics.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{of course, they have the same chance. they can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(turns to him)}
<D>__{jeff if anybody walked in here, i don't think they'd believe what they see.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you and me with long faces plunged into despair because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. we're two of the most frightening ghouls i've ever known.}
<A>__{jeff starts to smile at the realization.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you'd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well.}
<A>__{jeff smile is broad, and he starts to chuckle. she relaxes and joins him. she sits on his lap, her arms around his shoulders.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{whatever happened to that old saying "love thy neighbor."}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i think i will start reviving it tomorrow, with say miss torso for a start?}
<A>__{she gets up, goes to the blinds, and proceeds to lower them one by on.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(as she get up)}
<D>__{not if i have to move into an apartment across the courtyard and do the dance of the seven veils once an hour.}
<P>__{(as she lowers the blinds)}
<D>__{show's over for tonight.}
<A>__{he smiles. she goes to the table, picks up he overnight case.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{preview of the coming attractions.}
<A>__{she goes to the kitchen entrance, pauses.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{did mr. doyle think i stole this case.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(mock seriousness)}
<D>__{no, lisa i don't think he did.}
<A>__{she shrugs, goes into the kitchen, the camera panning her.}
