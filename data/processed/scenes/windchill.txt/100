<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{inside. safe! she sits there, out of breath. she glances over quickly at our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel. she chafes her hands to get the circulation going again. she turns down the volume on the radio.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(chattering teeth)}
<D>__{ i did it got through but i don't know how much she understood the operator i mean }
<A>__{he doesn't respond.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{ just have to hope maybe they can trace the line }
<A>__{when this too gets no response from him she looks over, frowning. she scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him. which is when we see }
<B>__{his ghost}
<A>__{standing outside the car, slack expressioned and staring. he stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{hang in there, can't be much longer...}
<A>__{she reaches to jostle him awake. one touch confirms her worst fears. she reaches up to switch on the interior light, to get a better look at him.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it seems for a moment she's going to be sick. she covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw throated terror. then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{no! please! don't leave me alone!}
<A>__{tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. she shakes him harder. his inert body spills to one side, slumping against her. her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her. she scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse. cowers against the passenger door. the interior light flickers out as the battery finally dies.}
