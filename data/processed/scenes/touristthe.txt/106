<L>__{interior demidov's hotel room day}
<A>__{demidov is getting dressed. it's an elaborate ritual: carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar, etc. his two bodyguards stand nervously at attention, watching him.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{when i was a young man, times were very hard. when an opportunity presented itself, you took it.}
<A>__{he pats talcum powder on himself. the men remain stone faced.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{i was twelve years old when gregor asked me if i was ready for a man's job. he was the top chelovek in our housing block. so i said yes. he gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him.}
<A>__{he points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table and snaps his fingers. scarface hands them to him.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{now it just so happened this boy was a friend of mine. i did not want to do this terrible thing. but when you come from the streets, you have no choice.}
<A>__{he carefully knots his tie in the mirror.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{i worked very hard for years to get past that life. so i would not have to do these terrible things. so i would have a choice...}
<A>__{he turns and smiles at his thick necked bodyguard. he gestures toward the man's holstered pistol }
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{i have people like you to do these things for me...}
<A>__{he holds out his hand; thick neck hands him the pistol.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{except that you don't!}
<A>__{suddenly demidov pistol whips the man across the face! blood explodes from thick neck's nose. he falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain. scarface looks on in fear. demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper. he drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{if you did your job properly, i wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit.}
<A>__{he turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands.}
