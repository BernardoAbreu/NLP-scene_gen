<D>__{you look lovely.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(she moves to sit, and lechter comes up and holds her chair for her)}
<D>__{no, i know you'd prefer "i'm glad you find me so..."}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{i'd prefer you to say what you feel.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{what is that that smells so wonderful.}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{i hope you'll find it so.}

<D>__{yes. it's good to see you regaining your strength...}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{thanks to you ...}
<A>__{we see lechter excuse himself, and retire into the kitchen. we see him taking down saucepans, and mixing what appears to}
<B>__{be a marinade.}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{now, what were we last speaking of...?}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{we were speaking of my father ...}
<A>__{lechter pours the marinade into a pan, lights the flame in the stove, wipes his hands, and returns to the diningroom.}

<D>__{...and my need for the institution...}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{freud, do you know...? freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon.}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{and how did he do that?}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{he saw the truth, and spoke it...}
<C>__{starling}
<D>__{i'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...}
<C>__{lechter}
<D>__{...you have to eat ...}
<A>__{lechter returns to the kitchen, indicating "one moment."}
<C>__{lechter }
<P>__{(as the camera takes him to the kitchen, and we half see the torso of a man sitting in a kitchen chair)}
<D>__{you've sought out the institution all your life, as you with it to replace your father. this is obvious. less obvious is this : that you require the institution not to support you, but to fail. for this keeps your father alive .}

<A>__{on starling, sitting, nodding, as she drinks her wine. she puts the glass down, a trifle woozy.}
<C>__{lechter }

<A>__{angle, starling, looking perplexed, at the kitchen where we see the form of lechter, moving across the kitchen.}
<B>__{angle on lechter.}
<A>__{as we see, he carries a scalpel, he moves toward the half }
<B>__{seen form of the man in the chair.}
<A>__{he bends down over the man, and we see that he carries a}
<B>__{scalpel and a small medical saw ...}
<C>__{lechter }
<D>__{...the only art in this dish, of course, is that it must be fresh ...}
