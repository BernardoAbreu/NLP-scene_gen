<A>__{widen to a stone chamber and a crazy looking dentist in a filthy long white smock, puffing on a cigarette holder, his ashes falling over billy as he works his mouth. a motorized drill is plugged into the wall, adjacent a filthy spittoon covered with blood; dried blood is spattered liberally around the chamber. billy spits out the blood and looks in the mirror.}

<D>__{...i have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. my gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when i massage them... they've pulled five of my teeth...}
<A>__{suddenly he starts shouting angrily in turkish. the dentist screams back at him. ad lib. the dentist still screaming, leans billy back in the chair and looks in his mouth.}
