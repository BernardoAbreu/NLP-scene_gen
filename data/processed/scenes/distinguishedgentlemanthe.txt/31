<L>__{42 exterior bait shack night}
<A>__{blinding lights. media circus. tv power cords, a huge tangle snaking back toward mobile generators. cameramen narrowly miss knocking each other into the water. a steel drum band plays "happy days are here again." the small crowd tommy's cronies, their pals, and a jubilant contingent of panthers led by hattie lets out a great whoop.}
<D>__{florida reporter #1 is that him? tricia, i believe congressman elect johnson is coming this way.}
<A>__{for the first time, we see tommy wearing a beautifully cut suit. he's instantly engulfed by lights, cameras, and supporters. an amazed cameraman, watching tommy, whispers to a producer.}

<D>__{thank you, thank you, all of you, for your help. give yourself a round of applause.}
<A>__{they do. as applause continues (o.s.), camera pans from reporter to reporter to reporter, their mikes bearing the call letters of different channels. on grandma being interviewed. she wears a johnson for congress button and speaks with manifest pride.}

<A>__{on tommy. speaking meaningfully, with great sincerity, he shows a gift for political discourse.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{we ran a positive campaign. we campaigned on the issues. the issue is leadership. leadership for the future. ask not what you can do for your country. the people have spoken. the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. live free or die. and in conclusion...read my lips!}
