<A>__{fry reaches a porch. it looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain. she starts back inside but something glints at the edge of her vision. fry turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the source of the glinterior excited hits on her breather. fry vaults off the porch and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing. soon she's running.}
