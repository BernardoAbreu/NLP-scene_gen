<L>__{interior pawnshop back room day}
<A>__{butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. sodomy and the judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to russell's old room.}
<L>__{interior russell's old room day}
<A>__{butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. it swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. zed is now bent over marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. maynard watches. both have their backs to butch. maynard faces the camera, grinning, while butch comes up behind him with the sword. miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see butch coming up behind maynard. his eyes widen.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{hey hillbilly.}
<A>__{maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword. butch screams... with one mighty swing, slashes maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on zed. maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. butch, while never taking his eyes off zed, thrusts the sword behind him, skewering maynard, then extracts it, pointing the blade toward zed. maynard collapses. zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butch's sword to marsellus' .45 automatic, which lies within reach. butch's eyes follow zed's.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you want that gun, zed? pick it up.}
<A>__{zed's hand inches toward the weapon. butch grips the sword tighter. zed studies butch. butch looks hard at zed. then a voice says:}
<C>__{marsellus }
<D>__{step aside, butch.}
<A>__{butch steps aside, revealing marsellus standing behind him, holding maynard's pump action shotgun. kaboom!!!! zed is blasted in the groin. down he goes, screaming in agony. marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, ejects the used shotgun shell. butch lowers the sword and hangs back. not a word, until:}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{marsellus}
<D>__{naw man. i'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!}
<A>__{long pause.}

<C>__{butch}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{the two men shake hands, then hug one another.}
<C>__{marsellus}
<D>__{go on now, get your ass outta here.}
<A>__{butch leaves russell's old room through the red curtains. marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.}
<C>__{marsellus}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hello mr. wolf, it's marsellus. gotta bit of a situation.}
