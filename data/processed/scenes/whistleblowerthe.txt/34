<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{clarkson leads kathy and the bosnian police through the hall. gurney's and ivs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't want to be examined here. some windows are still covered with wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. the floors still hold the stains of old blood. clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...}
<C>__{clarkson}
<D>__{seems we have two stabbings, one shooting, and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who can't remember what happened... average night back in brighton.}
<A>__{the cops stare at him, lost. as they file into a small room filled with tightly drawn curtains. they all squeeze into the center together. kathy is pressed against the large cop. clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing... zlata sehik, 40, muslim. her face is covered with wounds. she avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. she pulls her bed sheet up to her chin as...}

<C>__{clarkson }
<D>__{anyone?}
<A>__{no answer. clarkson looks to kathy to take control. she turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. she goes to speak, when... viko, 25, looks up, hesitant.}
<C>__{viko }
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{the cops turn. clarkson unclicks his pen. viko sees kathy, hungry for support. but danik scoffs.}

<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{viko}
<D>__{she is muslim. he said she deserved it.}

<C>__{kathy}

<D>__{complaint?}
<A>__{the other cops eye kathy, defiant. this is our turf. clarkson ushers the cops out. kathy catches viko's eye. simpatico. then follows the other out. kathy looks back at zlata, who lies helpless.}
