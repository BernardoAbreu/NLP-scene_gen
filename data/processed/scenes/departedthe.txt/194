<L>__{interior parking garage. night}
<A>__{costello, shot through the stomach, is moving through the dark. all that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig. plenty of places to hide. we hear gunfire in the distance. costello hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone. to his surprise the phone rings quite nearby. and keeps ringing. costello moves out into the open, and sees, at a near distance, colin, his shadow long on the concrete. he has a gun in his hand. costello moves out to face him.}
