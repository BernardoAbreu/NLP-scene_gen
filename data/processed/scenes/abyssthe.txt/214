<A>__{coffey works intently. his eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a face streaked with blood. he brings the rov into view with the boom arm. geek rov had a passenger. brigman. the diver is holding geek's skid with one hand, doing something with the other. he turns to look at coffey.}

<A>__{coffey releases the rov with the gripper and makes a grab at bud with the steel claw. bud dives. the gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow. bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out. we see he has managed to tie one end to geek's skids. coffey hits the button to activate the rov, sending an acoustic pulse to geek's transponder. the little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. coffey pivots his bid machine toward bud. bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage. he loops the rope around a twisted pipe. big geek is hauling ass away from him. the line snap taut an instant later. the rov strains, like a rottweiler on a leash... trying to go. the rope is slipping as bud fights to make a knot. flatbed slews around, thrusters whining. as it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. through the front panel we see coffey jerking on the controls. the big arm extends menacingly. the smaller from manipulators open. an enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. the big machine roars forward. straight at bud. bud gets his knot partly done. see flatbed looming. glare lit in its lights, bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as coffey closes the last few feet. one manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over. flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework. k cruuunch!!}
