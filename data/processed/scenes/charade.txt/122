<L>__{interior hotel lobby night}
<A>__{the night porter is asleep behind the desk. the elevator, gideon inside, keeps coming down. it passes the lobby level and keeps right on going, toward the basement.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{hey! how do you stop this thing?}
<A>__{the elevator passes out of sight, still going down. there is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. the night porter, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. he looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. he presses the call button and the motor starts. an instant later the cage appears and stops. the night porter opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the camera rushes past him to pick up gideon. his body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut. except that gideon has no strings to cut only a throat. from ear to ear.}
