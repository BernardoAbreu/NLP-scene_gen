<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior desert rock outcrop later}
<A>__{val, earl, rhonda, and burt prepare to try again. this time val has the rope and a new bomb. rhonda stands by him, ready with the lighter. earl lobs rocks out into the desert.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{where the hell are they? hope they didn't wise up.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{nope, there! that's one.}
<A>__{rhonda shakily lights the fuse. val heaves the bomb out and starts trolling. the creature swallows it. everyone drops down behind the boulder, val impulsively grabbing a second bomb. they tense with anticipatory glee but the creature suddenly spits its bomb back out ! it sails back right over their heads. it strikes the rocks above them, skittering down a crevice and landing in burt's pile of bombs! val, earl, and rhonda scatter. burt dives backward over a rock ledge. bababammm!! all the bombs explode, throwing rocks every where. the creatures streak away. val, earl and rhonda sprawl into the dirt, half stunned. when the panic is over, val and earl realize where they are fifty yards out in open desert! so is rhonda, off at an angle from them! only burt is safe on the rock outcrop. and the creatures are coming back fast! the stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the creatures burst up ahead of them one blocking rhonda's path, the other two cutting val and earl off! the creatures roar toward their easy prey! val and earl freeze. the ground bulges as the creatures "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them. rhonda stands stock still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature. over on the outcrop with the main group of people heather sizes up the situation.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{make noise. everybody! come on!}
<A>__{everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and clapping. burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks, firing a pistol into the dirt.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{come on, you slimebags! over here! fresh meat...!}
<A>__{the crowd keeps up the ruckus. the creatures are distracted by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after it. their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that. but they just stay where they are. their hook tentacles slide out, feeling all around. earl whispers:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{they're not falling for it!}
<A>__{heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i will make'em pay attention goddamnit...}
<A>__{but before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from view. val, rhonda, and earl remain frozen. what the hell is going on? nothing happens then a huge hump of earth suddenly wells up near rhonda. it sinks back down as fast as it appeared. it's like the creature suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then submerged again. another hump rises and falls right near val and earl. there's a pause as the men whisper:}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{they're...they're trying to make us move!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{or just knock us over. look, use the bomb!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{it's out last one. we can't kill them all.}
<A>__{the creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some coming perilously close. they know they'll eventually topple their prey. one comes so close to val and earl that pebbles roll down its sides into their boots!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{use the fucking bomb!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(slowly; terrified)}
<D>__{i want to live for the three days.}
<A>__{more humps rise and fall. val gives in. he signals rhonda, gesturing with the bomb. she understands. he'll set it off, driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the outcrop. val digs for the lighter. doesn't have it. earl digs for it, too. but he doesn't have it either! they go dead pale. how can that be? they look across fifty feet of deadly open ground trembling rhonda holds up the lighter! over on the outcrop, burt shouts:}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{what's wrong? use the bomb, for godsake!}
<A>__{val signals to rhonda to throw the lighter. she nods. but just before she does, a hump starts rising directly under her! she fights to keep her balance struggling to keep from taking that single step which will instantly tell the creatures where she is. but there's no hope. the hump jerks higher. her boots slip down the gravelly side! instantly the creature twists toward her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt. she screams and dashes for val and earl. they run to meet her. the other creatures surface. the trio is cut off from the rock outcrop! val and earl link up with rhonda and they all run madly while rhonda tries to light val's bomb fuse. but suddenly val yanks the bomb away.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{no wait! this way!}
<A>__{he veers off in a new direction. startled earl and rhonda have no choice but to follow. as they desperately try to catch up to val:}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?!!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i got a goddamn plan!!}
<A>__{earl looks up ahead. they're headed right for }
