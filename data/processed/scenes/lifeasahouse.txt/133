<C>__{george}
<D>__{two ribs, a finger, a leg, a bruised kidney and a mild concussion aren't bad considering he landed on brick.}
<A>__{neither robin nor sam attempts a response. finally:}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i better get the kids home.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{not a perfect day.}
<A>__{robin stands. george stands because robin's standing. without warning, robin begins to cry again. ryan and adam stop playing ball. sam studies her before finally lowering his eyes. with her kids looking on, george stands still, hesitant to comfort her. there's a moment where all that there is, where the only thing seen or heard is robin's pain. after an awkward amount of time, she wipes her eyes, wipes her nose, crosses around the table to sam and kisses the top of his head, then his cheek. without a word, she walks to her car and climbs in; ryan and adam quickly join her in the car.}
