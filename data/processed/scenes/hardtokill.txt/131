<L>__{interior power plant equipment room night}
<A>__{a mesh enclosed space above the main dynamo room. deafening din of turbine generators below. a bulb illuminates sonny sitting rigidly on a metal chair. nolan, a cop we saw earlier in the film, and turner (whom we haven't seen before) play cards, making sure sonny goes nowhere.}

<P>__{(re: power plant)}
<D>__{it's fun, huh, kid? kinda like a field trip.}
<A>__{sonny glowers. there's a lot of his father in him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i'm remembering both of you. and when my dad gets here }
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{he's gonna have a long trip, kid starting from forest lawn.}
<A>__{they both laugh derisively.}
<C>__{nolan}
<D>__{by the time this night's over, your old man'll have a use for that phony grave of his.}
<A>__{a wall mounted phone rings. nolan picks it up. he listens seriously for a long beat.}
<C>__{nolan}
<D>__{yeah... yeah we'll be right down.}
<A>__{he hangs up, stands. so does turner. they exit the wire mesh space, re close the door on sonny.}
<C>__{nolan}
<P>__{(to sonny)}
<D>__{we'll come back with your french fries.}
<P>__{(padlocks the door)}
<D>__{don't leave home without us.}
<A>__{angle stairway down from equipment room nolan and turner clump down and away, laughing and making wisecracks.}
