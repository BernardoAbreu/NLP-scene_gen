<L>__{interior stairs landing malahide's house day}
<A>__{kyle advances carefully, and slowly, from the stairs onto the landing. he looks about him at every step he takes. ahead of him on the landing is a door, which is very slightly ajar. he advances gingerly down the landing to the door. when he reaches it, he pauses. we see his face working as he ponders his choices should he push it open inch by slow inch, or slam it inwards quickly? very slowly he moves his hand towards the door. the camera matches his movement, moving in on his hand, the door, and the space between. his fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door when another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist. julia has crept up beside him on the landing while all his attention was on the door. kyle swings round in horror, his mouth opening to scream when he sees that julia has her other hand to her mouth, her finger at her lips in a silencing gesture. there is of course, nothing for him to recognize from the monstrous vision of the previous night. julia's arms, chest, and face are completely re skinned now. all kyle sees is a beautiful stranger in a white dress.}
