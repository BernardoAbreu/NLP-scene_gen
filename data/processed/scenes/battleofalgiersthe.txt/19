<L>__{19 bar. european city facing casbah. outside inside. sunset.}
<A>__{it is dusk. in the european city, the first lights are visible. people begin to crowd the bars for an aperitif. an algerian shoeshine man leaves his workbox at the entrance of the bar. he goes to the counter. he is tall and thin as a reed. he takes from his pocket a handful of change; his hands tremble slightly as he counts it. the barman recognizes him, fills a glass of wine, and places it in front of him. the algerian pays and takes the glass. it's probably not his first; the trembling of his hands increases. the algerian drinks the wine in one gulp, then goes to the door. he waits patiently while some europeans enter. he goes out, picks up his workbox, and moves away.}
